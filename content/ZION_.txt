supervision and regulation 

this section describes the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers and taxpayers these regulations are not generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry which have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders furthermore changes in applicable laws or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results 

general 

we are subject to the provisions of the national bank act and other statutes governing national banks as well as the rules and regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” and the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” we are also subject to examination and supervision by the occ and examination by the cfpb in respect of federal consumer financial regulations we as well as some of our subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies these regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the securities and exchange commission “sec” financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and state securities regulators 

the national bank act 

our corporate affairs are governed by the national bank act and related regulations are administered by the occ with respect to securities matters we are not subject to the securities act but are subject to occ regulations governing securities offerings our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the exchange act which vests the occ with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the exchange act applicable to national banks though we continue to make filings required by the exchange act with the sec as a voluntary filer these statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as welldeveloped as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held corporations 

the national bank act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable ie holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the occ the occ has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the national bank act assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank’s stock our common stock has a par value of 0001 in addition according to the occ it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation including robust capital standards prompt corrective action requirements and supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level 

capital standards – basel framework 

at december 31 2021 we met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules which include certain riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the occ the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and risk weights where applicable and other factors affecting the numerator and denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratio requirements are as follows 

• 45 cet1 to riskweighted assets 

• 60 tier 1 capital ie cet1 plus additional tier 1 to riskweighted assets 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

• 80 total capital ie tier 1 plus tier 2 to riskweighted assets and 

• 40 tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets known as the “tier 1 leverage ratio” 

the basel iii capital rules also require us to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress composed entirely of cet1 and in excess of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of 1 cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 2 tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and 3 total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 financial institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income 

capital planning and stress testing 

we utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions our 2021 internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected the ongoing economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the results of the stress test indicated that we would maintain regulatory capital ratios at levels adequate for our risk profile throughout the ninequarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act require many banks to adhere to an annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process and stress testing administered by the federal reserve board “frb” we are not regulated by the frb and therefore are not subject to this process however we use the frbs ccar process including published economic scenarios to inform our stress testing activities 

liquidity 

our liquidity profile remained very strong during 2021 we manage liquidity in accordance with the basel iii liquidity requirements and we utilize internal liquidity stress tests as our primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including but not limited to holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets maintaining levels of readily available contingency funding concentrations of funding sources and the maturity profile of liabilities 

financial privacy and cyber security 

the federal banking regulators have enacted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties including provisions of the grammleachbliley act which require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 

state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have enacted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and have provided detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements in june 2018 the california legislature passed the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” which took effect on january 1 2020 and which was further amended in november 2020 by the california privacy rights act the “cpra” the ccpa as amended covers businesses that obtain or access 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

personal information on california residents grants them enhanced privacy rights and control over their personal information and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to individual data privacy rights some of the rights afforded to california residents also extend to california employees though the cpra amendments now exempt certain employee information and employer usage from some of the cpra provisions until at least january 1 2023 other states have implemented or are considering similar privacy laws we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate 

data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly remain a focus of state and federal regulators are likely to be the subject of future rule making and will continue to have a significant impact on our risk management practices 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia as modified by the basel iii capital rules an insured depository institution will generally be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 an insured depository institution will generally be classified as undercapitalized if it has a cet1 ratio less than 45 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio less than 6 a total riskbased capital ratio less than 8 and a tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4 

at december 31 2021 our capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered well capitalized under these regulations 

an institution that is classified as wellcapitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth interest rates paid on deposits the acceptance of brokered deposits and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator add back some language taken out 

other regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

• limitations on dividends payable to shareholders our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

• safety and soundness standards prescribed in the fdicia including standards related to internal controls information systems internal audit loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies

environmental social and governance “esg” standards and concerns continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years we are closely monitoring developments in standards published by esg interest groups and organizations as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to esg issues although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations our ongoing monitoring enables us to enhance our business practices by incorporating esg recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors customers employees and communities we publish a corporate responsibility report that provides a summary of how we address esg issues the report is available on our website

human capital management 

we are proud of our employees who bring their unique diverse talents to work each day we are committed to identifying recognizing and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees and rewarding them for their contributions to our success 

the covid19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on how we work and the work we perform since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 we successfully transitioned approximately 70 of our employees to working remotely we implemented additional programs to promote mental health and wellness as well as policies and procedures to keep our employees safe including workfromhome arrangements elevated cleaning standards of our facilities required masking and we strongly encourage our employees to be fully vaccinated we continue to monitor and adjust our policies and procedures to keep our people safe

the number of fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2021 totaled 9685 and remained relatively flat from the prior year period the following schedule presents certain demographic attributes of our employees at december 31 2021 

schedule 1 



the following objectives and initiatives are integral to our human capital management efforts

employees and offer networking and initiatives that support our commitment to diversity both internally and externally 

attracting developing and retaining talent for longterm success 

we are committed to attracting developing and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the markets in which we operate to helping our employees grow in their careers and to actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities as we attract and hire talent we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future

we are also mindful of the increasing competition for talent in the current labor market our overall 2021 turnover rates and timetofill for vacancies were comparable to the annual rates we experienced prior to the pandemic we continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements 

recognizing engaging and rewarding our employees 

we support a culture of integrity engagement and achievement through comprehensive rewards and recognition our programs are designed to enhance the employee experience drive retention promote recognition and reward high performance we provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk 

we routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender minority status and other factors these actions help us compensate employees fairly during 2021 we enlisted the services of an independent third party that found after adjusting for relevant variables such as education experience performance and geography women are paid on average approximately 99 of what men are paid and people of color are paid approximately 98 of what white employees are paid 

our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums which include quarterly leadership calls biannual employee opinion surveys and targeted focus groups these forums for employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals and reinforce our guiding principles and code of business conduct and ethics

 item 1a risk factors 

we generate revenue and grow our businesses by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks these risks are outlined in our risk management framework our board has established an audit committee a compensation committee a risk oversight committee “roc” and appointed an enterprise risk management committee “ermc” to oversee and implement the risk management framework the ermc is comprised of senior management and is chaired by the chief risk officer our largest risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in extensions of credit to customers in addition to credit risk these committees also monitor the following risk areas market and interest rate risk liquidity risk strategic and business risk operational risk technology risk cyber risk capitalfinancial reporting risk legalcompliance risk including regulatory risk and reputational risk as outlined in our risk taxonomy we have developed policies procedures and controls designed to address these risks but there can be no certainty that our actions will be effective to prevent or limit the effects of these risks on our business or performance although not comprehensive risk factors that are material to us are described below 

credit risk 

credit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks a decline in the strength of the us economy in general or the local economies in which we conduct operations could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan and investment portfolios an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses “acl” 

we have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio including loans secured by real estate oil and gasrelated lending and leveraged and enterprise value lending which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results 

concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect us concentration risk across our loan and investment securities portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to us due to similar exposures between the two asset types counterparty risk arising from derivative or securities financing transactions could also pose additional credit risk 

we engage in commercial real estate “cre” term and construction and land acquisition and development lending primarily in our western states footprint we also have a concentration in oil and gasrelated lending primarily in texas as well as concentrations in leveraged and enterprise value lending across our entire footprint these concentrations are subject to specific risks including governmental and social responses to environmental issues and climate change volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateral values and activity levels we may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the us 

we provide a wide range of banking products and related services through our local management teams and unique brands in arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah washington and wyoming at december 31 2021 loan balances associated with our banking operations in utahidaho texas and california comprised 77 of the commercial lending portfolio 73 of the cre lending portfolio and 71 of the consumer lending portfolio as a result of this geographic concentration our financial performance depends largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly deterioration in economic conditions such as that caused by climate change or natural disasters may specifically affect these states and could result in higher credit losses and significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results 

for information about how we manage credit risk see “credit risk management” on page 48 in mda

market and interest rate risk 

we could be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

adverse economic conditions negatively affect our business including our loan and investment portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition prolonged periods of slow growth significant inflationary pressures volatility and disruption in financial markets continued uncertainties and disruptions arising from the covid19 pandemic including the emergence of new variants and other adverse economic conditions could lead to lower demand for loans higher credit losses and lower fee income among other effects 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect our results 

net interest income is the largest component of our revenue interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability management committee factors beyond our control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase our risk these factors include changes in the prevailing interest rate environment competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb as interest rates on earning assets decline our cost of funds may not decline commensurately conversely rising rates may result in our cost of funds increasing more than expected some components of our balance sheet are very sensitive to rising and falling rates 

interest rates on our financial instruments are subject to change based on developments related to libor which could adversely impact our revenue expenses and value of those financial instruments 

the london interbank offered rate “libor” is being phased out globally and us banking regulators instructed banks to cease entering into new lending arrangements using libor no later than december 31 2021 and migrate to alternative reference rates no later than june 2023 

the adoption of alternative reference rates continues to evolve in the marketplace the market transition away from libor is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could 

• adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the value of our floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments indexed to libor or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s dominant role in determining market interest rates globally 

• require consent from counterparties regarding the amendment of certain outstanding contracts indexed to libor 

• result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in financial instruments and 

• require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmarks 

the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs loan and investment portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain 

for information about how we manage the transition from libor interest rate risk and market risk see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 57 in mda 

liquidity risk 

we and the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned to us by rating agencies the rates we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we and our securities receive from recognized rating agencies ratings downgrades to 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

us or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our liquidity position financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

changes in sources of liquidity and capital and liquidity requirements may limit our operations and potential growth 

our primary source of liquidity is deposits from our customers which may be impacted by marketrelated forces and a variety of other events liquidity requirements and sources are also subject to comprehensive supervision by the occ and the fdic 

for information about how we manage liquidity risk see “liquidity risk management” on page 62 in mda 

strategic and business risk 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the soundness and stability of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us 

we may not be able to hire or retain qualified personnel or effectively promote our corporate culture and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of changes in the workplace marketplace economy and regulatory environment 

our ability to execute our strategy provide services and remain competitive may suffer if we are unable to recruit or retain qualified people or if the costs of employee compensation and benefits increase substantially bank regulatory agencies have published regulations and guidance that limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel some of these limitations may not apply to institutions with which we compete for talent in particular as we are more frequently competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other entities that may not have the same limitations on compensation as we do if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely or materially affected 

our ability to retain talent may also be adversely affected by changes in the economy and workforce trends priorities migration modes of delivery and other considerations such as the increased ability of employees to work from anywhere in many industries this growth in remote work and other changing priorities and benefits has led to an increase in compensation and related expenses and workplace challenges such as fewer opportunities for facetoface interactions training and mentoring new employees promoting a cohesive corporate culture and increased competition for experienced labor especially in highdemand and highlyskilled categories inflationary pressures have also increased our compensation costs and are likely to continue to do so in the future 

we have made and are continuing to make significant changes that include among other things organizational restructurings efficiency initiatives and replacement or upgrades of technology systems to improve our control environment and operating efficiency the ultimate success and completion of these changes and their effects on us may vary significantly from initial planning which could materially adversely affect us 

over the last several years we have completed numerous improvement projects including the merger of our bank holding company into the bank combining the legal charters of our seven affiliate banks into one consolidating 15 loan operations sites into two replacing our core loan systems upgrading our accounting systems installing a credit origination work flow system streamlining our small business and retail lending mortgage wealth management and foreign exchange businesses and investing in data quality and information security 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

ongoing investments continue in a variety of strategic projects designed to improve our products and services and to simplify how we do business these projects include the replacement of our core deposit systems the development of a collection of customerfacing digital capabilities such as improved online and mobile banking applications and services and the enhancement of the online treasury management portal for our business customers these initiatives and other changes continue to be implemented and are in various stages of completion by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings expected efficiencies and related items are subject to change and significant variability there can be no certainty that we will achieve the expected benefits or other intended results associated with these projects 

operational risk 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods prolonged drought and pandemics may adversely affect us and the general economy financial and capital markets and specific industries 

the occurrence of pandemics natural disasters and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our operations we have significant operations and number of customers in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters have and are likely to continue to occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods prolonged droughts and other weatherrelated events which may become more frequent and intense these types of catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy our business and customers and have posed physical risks to our property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on us and our customers a significant catastrophic event could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial results 

our operations could be disrupted by the effects of our new and ongoing projects and initiatives 

we may encounter significant operational disruption arising from our numerous projects and initiatives these may include significant time delays cost overruns loss of key people technological problems and processing failures we may also experience operational disruptions due to capacity constraints service level failures and inadequate performance the level of concentration replacement costs and other risks arising from our dependence on thirdparty vendors any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems processes control environment procedures and employees the ultimate effect of any significant disruption to our business could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect us including our control environment operating efficiency and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

because of their inherent limitations internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of us and adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we could be adversely affected by internal and external fraud schemes 

attempts to commit fraud by both internal and external actors are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and may go undetected by the systems and procedures we have in place to monitor our operations we have suffered losses in the past as a result of these schemes and will not be able to identify prevent or otherwise mitigate all instances of fraud in the future that have the potential to result in material losses 

we use models in the management of the bank there is risk that these models are inaccurate in various ways which can cause us to make suboptimal decisions 

we rely on models in the management of the bank for example we use models to inform our estimate of the allowance for credit losses to manage interest rate and liquidity risk to project stress losses in various segments of our loan and investment portfolios and to project net revenue under stress models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons and cannot perfectly predict outcomes management decisions based in part on such models therefore may be suboptimal

we outsource various operations to thirdparty vendors which could adversely impact our business and operational performance 

we rely on various vendors to perform operational activities to conduct our business although there are benefits in entering into these relationships there are risks associated with such activities our operational controls and thirdparty management programs may not provide adequate oversight and control and inadequate performance by third parties can adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and conduct our business replacing or finding alternatives for vendors who do not perform adequately can be difficult and costly and may also adversely impact our customers and other operations particularly when circumstances require us to make changes under tight time constraints many of our vendors have experienced adverse effects upon operations supply chains personnel and businesses arising from covid19 and other events all of which can impact our operations as well

technology risk 

we could be adversely affected by our ability to develop adopt and implement technology advancements 

our ability to remain competitive is increasingly dependent upon our ability to maintain critical technological capabilities and to identify and develop new valueadded products for existing and future customers these technological competitive pressures arise from both traditional banking and nontraditional sources larger banks may have greater resources and economies of scale attendant to maintaining existing capabilities and developing digital and other technologies fintechs and other technology platform companies continue to emerge and compete with traditional financial institutions across a wide variety of products and services the expansion of blockchain technologies and the potential creation and adoption of central bank digital currencies present similar risks our failure to remain technologically competitive could impede our time to market and reduce customer satisfaction product accessibility and relevance 

we could be adversely impacted by system vulnerabilities failures or outages impacting operations and customer services such as online and mobile banking 

we rely on hundreds of information technology systems that work together in supporting internal operations and customer services vulnerabilities in or a failure or outage of one or many of these systems could impact the ability to perform internal operations and provide services to customers such as online banking mobile banking remote deposit capture and other services dependent on system processing these risks increase as systems and software approach the end of their useful life or require more frequent updates and modifications we cannot guarantee that such occurrences will not have a significant operational or customer impact 

for information regarding risks associated with the replacement or upgrades of our core technology systems see “strategic and business risk” on page 14 in risk factors for information about how we manage technology risk see “operational technology and cyber risk management” on page 65 in mda 

cyber risk 

we are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations information security risks for large financial institutions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and internet connections eg internet of things the internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external third parties

third parties including vendors and suppliers also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems in incidents involving third parties we may not be informed timely of any effect on our services or our data or be able to participate in any investigation notification or remediation that occurs as a result any such incidents may have a material adverse effect upon our operations reputation customers and services the possibility of thirdparty or employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we will be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities we and our thirdparty vendors have experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past that have not had material impact to our data customers or operations but there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or significant security breach will not occur in the future or if any future occurrences will be adequately addressed  it is impossible to determine the severity or potential effects of these events with any certainty but any such breach could result in material adverse consequences for us and our customers 

system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities and our ability to implement them in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability

capitalfinancial reporting risk 

internal stress testing and capital management as well as provisions of the national bank act and occ regulations may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

we are required to submit stress tests to the occ because we have assets in excess of 10 billion and we continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions the stress testing and other applicable regulatory requirements may among other things require us to increase our capital levels limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under the national bank act and occ regulations certain capital transactions including share repurchases are subject to the approval of the occ these requirements may limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to us 

we must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by our banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions as well as the particular conditions risk profiles and our growth plans compliance with capital requirements may limit our ability to expand and has required and may require us to raise additional capital these uncertainties and risks including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties may increase our cost of capital and other financing costs

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory compliance risk 

we are exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatory compliance risk we use a number of complex financial products and services for our own capital funding investment and risk management needs and also provide them to our customers estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions the level of regulatory compliance oversight continues to be heightened therefore identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

at december 31 2021 we had 1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to amegy bank “amegy” california bank  trust “cbt” and zions bank if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value we may have to take a charge related to the impairment of our goodwill such a charge could result from among other factors a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a sustained decline in the price of our common stock

laws and regulations applicable to us and the financial services industry impose significant limitations on our business activities and subject us to increased regulation and additional costs 

we and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs related to personnel systems consulting and other activities in order to comply with banking regulations see “supervision and regulation” on page 6 for further information about the regulations applicable to us and the financial services industry generally 

regulators the us congress state legislatures and other governing or consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies including laws that are designed to promote protect or penalize certain activities or industries and their access to financial services we are and may in the future become subject to these laws by offering our products and services to certain industries or in certain locations the nature of these laws and regulations and their effect on our future business and performance cannot be predicted 

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be enacted however if enacted some of these proposals could adversely affect us by among other things impacting aftertax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting our ability to grow increasing fdic insurance assessments taxes or fees on our funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that we could offer and requiring us to raise capital at inopportune times 

political developments may also result in substantial changes in tax international trade immigration and other policies the extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain as are the potential direct and indirect impacts whether beneficial or adverse regulations and laws may be modified or repealed and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be enacted 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings our exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments more frequent claims and actions resulting from fraud schemes perpetrated by or involving our customers new regulations promulgated under recently enacted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and enforcement and legal

actions against banking organizations any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties eg civil money penalties under applicable banking laws injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have been increasing dramatically this has affected and will continue to adversely affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage for certain claims and significantly increase our deductibles and premiums associated with the coverage in addition any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings which may restrict or limit our activities 

the corporate and securities laws applicable to us are not as welldeveloped as those applicable to a statechartered corporation which may impact our ability to effect corporate transactions in an efficient and optimal manner 

our corporate affairs are governed by the national bank act and related regulations are administered by the occ as to securities laws the occ maintains its own securities offering framework applicable to national banks and their securities offerings and our compliance with the exchange act is governed and enforced by the occ 

state corporate codes including that of utah are widely recognized updated by legislative action from timetotime and are often based on and influenced by model statutes the federal securities law regime established by the securities act and the exchange act and the sec’s extensive and welldeveloped framework thereunder are widely used by public companies the occ statutory and regulatory frameworks have been used by publiclytraded banking organizations relatively rarely and are not as welldeveloped as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to other public corporations while certain specific risks associated with operating under these frameworks are described below unless and until these frameworks are further developed and established over time the uncertainty of how these frameworks might apply to any given corporate or securities matters may prevent us from effecting transactions in an efficient and optimal manner or perhaps at all 

differences between the national bank act and state law requirements regarding mergers could hinder our ability to execute acquisitions as efficiently and advantageously as bank holding companies or other financial institutions 

unlike state corporate law the national bank act requires shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for exceptions in the case of various “minor” mergers such as a parent company’s merger with a subsidiary or an acquirer’s merger with an unaffiliated entity in which the shares issued by the acquirer do not exceed a designated percentage the national bank act and related regulations may also complicate the structuring of certain nonbank acquisitions 

these differences could adversely affect the ability of the bank and other banks registered under the national bank act to efficiently consummate acquisition transactions in addition such differences could make us less competitive as a potential acquirer in certain circumstances given that our acquisition proposal may be conditioned on shareholder approval while our competitors’ proposals will not have such a condition 

we are subject to restrictions on permissible activities that would limit the types of business we may conduct and that may make acquisitions of other financial companies more challenging 

under applicable laws and regulations bank holding companies and banks are generally limited to business activities and investments that are related to banking or are financial in nature the range of permissible financial activities is set forth in the grammleachbliley act and is more limited for banks than for bank holding company organizations the differences relate mainly to insurance underwriting but not insurance agency activities and merchant banking but not brokerdealer and investment advisory activities the fact that we do not have a bank holding company could make future acquisitions of financial institutions with such operations more challenging

reputational risk 

we are presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational regulatory compliance and legal risks 

any of the aforementioned risks may give rise to adverse publicity and other expressions of negative public opinion increased regulatory scrutiny and damaged relationships among other reputational risks 

other risk 

our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic created economic financial and social disruptions that have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations including the direct and indirect impact on our employees customers communities counterparties service providers other market participants and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the pandemic is likely to continue to affect consumer confidence and business activity generally including loan demand deposit levels and the market for other financial products or services disruptions in supply chains have in some instances adversely affected our ability to procure equipment and materials for our employees and facilities in a timely fashion and may increase our costs for the same pressures on the cost and availability of labor have also negatively affected us and many of our customers these disruptions are likely to continue as the pandemic evolves 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will negatively affect our businesses financial condition liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted uncertainties arising from evolving political and governmental responses to the pandemic such as vaccine and testing mandates and other workplace policies and requirements will also continue to impact our business and results particularly as more of our employees return to our physical locations the longterm effects of the pandemic and the increasing interest in remotework environments may reduce our need for physical office space while negatively impacting our ability to sell or sublease any excess space or selling and lease termination expenses associated with our leased and owned properties 

esgrelated developments could lead or require us to restrict or modify some of our business activities 

esg expectations of investors and regulators could over time lead us to restrict or modify some of our business practices in addition our business practices could be adversely affected by laws and regulations enacted or promulgated by federal state and local governments that relate to environmental and social issues for example in 2021 and 2022 certain states passed or considered passing laws prohibiting financial institutions from restricting the services that they provide to certain types of businesses if the institutions also conduct business with governmental entities in such states depending on how these laws are worded and implemented they could adversely affect our ability to manage risk

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

this form 10k presents nongaap financial measures in addition to generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” financial measures to provide investors with additional information the adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are presented in the following schedules we consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results as they provide a basis for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons we use these nongaap financial measures to assess our performance financial position and for presentations of our performance to investors we believe that presenting these nongaap financial measures permits investors to assess our performance on the same basis as that applied by management

zions bancorporation national association 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other financial services companies although nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under gaap 

tangible common equity and related measures 

tangible common equity and related measures are nongaap measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information about our use of shareholders’ equity and provide a basis for evaluating the performance of a company more consistently whether acquired or developed internally

results of operations 

navigating through the ongoing pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continued to impact our operations throughout 2021 though its effects varied compared with the prior year 

• during 2020 credit concerns were high given the significant uncertainty of the depth and duration of the pandemic and the related shutdowns which resulted in a significant increase in the allowance for credit losses however with strong government stimulus and the development of vaccines and treatments consumer and business spending rebounded in 2021 as such credit concerns abated significantly during 2021 resulting in significant releases of the credit loss reserves we added in 2020 

• since the beginning of the pandemic we funded 102 billion of paycheck protection program “ppp” loans 29 billion in 2021 and 73 billion in 2020 for approximately 77000 customers positively impacting loan balances and interest income we ranked as the 10th largest originator of ppp loans by dollar volume of all the participating financial institutions as disclosed by the us small business administration “sba” in 2021 we continued to strengthen our relationships with more than 20000 newtobank ppp customers which resulted in additional revenue generating services total interest income from ppp loans during 2021 was 235 million of which 138 million was related to accelerated recognition of net unamortized deferred fees on 65 billion of ppp loans forgiven by the sba 

• demand for loans softened considerably in 2020 as a result of increased uncertainty and reduced economic activity loan attrition continued in 2021 but reversed course during the latter half of the year excluding ppp loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 was robust reflecting one of our strongest growth rates in recent years 

• as with the prior year we assisted our employees in adapting to a workfromhome environment where applicable to help limit the spread of covid19 by modifying operating hours limiting lobby visits and requiring masks to help keep our employees and communities safe 

• the domestic money supply as measured by the federal reserve increased significantly in 2021 this increase together with our ongoing efforts to deepen relationships with customers positively affected our deposit growth 

• as 2021 progressed we experienced elevated turnover rates in some of our entrylevel jobs and found it increasingly difficult to fill employment vacancies a challenge faced by many companies in response we have adjusted both cash and noncash compensation and benefits to stem the turnover which has generally normalized

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 



 relative to 2020 our financial performance for 2021 reflects 

• stable net interest income driven largely by significant increases in average interestearning assets growth in these assets contributed to compression in the net interest margin “nim” given an increased concentration in loweryielding assets and the low interest rate environment 

• significant growth of 111 billion or 16 in average interestearning assets and an increase of 126 billion or 20 in average total deposits this deposit growth funded increases of 80 billion and 42 billion in average money market investments and average investment securities respectively we actively managed our balance sheet in view of the low interest rate environment and evaluated opportunities to deploy excess liquidity into shorttomedium duration assets we balanced competing objectives of increasing income maintaining asset sensitivity to benefit from rising rates maintaining sufficient liquidity for changes in deposit trends and supporting loan growth 

• a 129 million or 22 increase in total noninterest income increases in customerrelated fees were primarily due to improved customer transaction volume new client activity and deepening of existing client relationships specifically resulting in the growth of card commercial account and wealth management fees increases in noncustomerrelated revenue were driven largely by net securities gains related to our small business investment company “sbic” investment portfolio 

• an increase of 37 million or 2 in noninterest expense arising from inflationary and competitive labor pressures on wages and higher profit sharing expense as well as increases in professional and legal services expenses mainly due to various technologyrelated and other outsourced services associated with ongoing investments in our core technology systems 

• strong credit performance net loan and lease chargeoffs were 6 million or 001 of average loans exppp in 2021 compared with net chargeoffs of 105 million or 022 of average loans exppp in the prior year the provision for credit losses was a negative 276 million in 2021 compared with a positive 414 million in 2020 reflecting improvements in economic forecasts loan portfolio changes and strong credit quality 

• a decrease of 26 billion or 5 in total loans and leases due to the forgiveness of ppp loans and a decline in 14 family residential mortgage loans excluding ppp loans total loans and leases increased 11 billion or 2 reflecting improving loan growth trends during the second half of 2021

net interest income and net interest margin 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities and is approximately 76 of our net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income for the year the nim is derived from both the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and their respective yields and rates 

schedule 6 

net interest income and net interest margin 



1 rates are calculated using amounts in thousands and a tax rate of 21 for the periods presented 

net interest income remained relatively stable at 22 billion in 2021 relative to the prior year and was driven largely by a significant increase in average interestearning assets growth in these assets had a dilutive effect on the nim given an increased concentration in loweryielding assets and the low interest rate environment 

average interestearning assets increased 111 billion or 16 driven by growth in average money market investments and investment securities these increases were partially offset by declines in consumer mortgage loans average money market investments including shortterm deposits held at the federal reserve increased to 134 of average interestearning assets compared with 43 average securities increased to 233 of average interestearning assets compared with 211 as we have actively deployed excess liquidity into shorttomedium duration assets 

the nim was 272 compared with 315 the yield on average interestearning assets was 279 in 2021 a decrease of 58 basis points “bps” the yield on total loans decreased 13 bps to 376 compared with 389 excluding ppp loans the yield on loans decreased 33 bps the yield on securities decreased 42 bps primarily due to lower yields on reinvestment of principal payments and other purchases throughout 2021 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

  average loans and leases decreased 10 billion or 2 from 530 billion in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in 14 family residential mortgage loans the decline in our mortgage loan portfolio is partly due to the low interest rate environment and refinancing activity we generally originate residential mortgage loans and sell them to governmentsponsored entities as part of our interest rate risk management efforts to limit our balance sheet exposure to longterm assets 

since early 2020 we provided assistance to many small businesses through the sba ppp and originated a total of 102 billion in ppp loans during 2021 and 2020 ppp loans totaling 65 billion and 13 billion respectively were forgiven by the sba the yield on these loans was 516 and 322 for 2021 and 2020 respectively and was positively impacted by accelerated amortization of deferred fees on paid off or forgiven ppp loans of 138 million and 26 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 the remaining unamortized net origination fees on these loans totaled 45 million and 102 million respectively 

average total deposits increased 126 billion to 763 billion at an average cost of 004 in 2021 from 637 billion at an average cost of 017 in 2020 average interestbearing liabilities increased 25 billion or 7 and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities decreased 26 bps to 014 the rate paid on total deposits and interestbearing liabilities was 007 a significant decrease from 022 during 2020 which was primarily due to low interestbearing deposit rates and strong noninterestbearing deposit growth

zions bancorporation national association 

average availableforsale “afs” securities balances increased 42 billion or 29 in 2021 from 142 billion in 2020 mainly due to an increase in our mortgagebacked securities portfolio 

average borrowed funds decreased 14 billion in 2021 with average shortterm borrowings decreasing 11 billion and average longterm borrowings decreasing 03 billion the average rate paid on shortterm borrowings decreased 45 bps the rate paid on longterm debt decreased 9 bps from the prior year primarily due to senior debt that matured during 2021 we continued to rely less on borrowed funds due to strong deposit growth during the year

the allowance for credit losses “acl” is the combination of both the allowance for loan and lease losses “alll” and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments “rulc” the alll represents the estimated current expected credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date the rulc represents the estimated reserve for current expected credit losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments changes in the alll and rulc net of chargeoffs and recoveries are recorded as the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments respectively in the income statement the acl for debt securities is estimated separately from loans 

on january 1 2020 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” 201613 credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and its subsequent updates often referred to as the current expected credit loss “cecl” model upon adoption of this asu we recorded the full amount of the acl for loans and leases of 526 million resulting in an aftertax increase to retained earnings of 20 million the impact of the adoption of cecl for our securities portfolio was less than 1 million as a result of the cecl accounting standard the acl is subject to economic forecasts that may change materially from period to period 

the provision for credit losses which is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments was a negative 276 million in 2021 compared with a positive 414 million in 2020 the acl decreased 282 million to 553 million at december 31 2021 the ratio of acl to net loans and leases exppp at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 113 and 174 respectively the provision for security losses was less than 1 million during 2021 and 2020

the acl was 553 million at december 31 2021 compared with 835 million at december 31 2020 the bar chart above shows the broad categories of change in the acl from the prior year period the second bar represents changes in economic forecasts and current economic conditions which decreased the acl by 220 million from the prior year due to improvements in both realized economic results and economic forecasts compared with the economic stress caused by the covid19 pandemic in the prior year and was partially offset by the expected impact of the resurgence of covid19 cases resulting from the omicron variant 

the third bar represents changes in credit quality factors and includes riskgrade migration and specific reserves against loans which when combined decreased the acl by 25 million indicating significant improvements in credit quality net loan and lease chargeoffs were 6 million or 001 of average loans exppp in 2021 compared with 105 million or 022 of average loans exppp in the prior year reflecting strong credit performance 

the fourth bar represents loan portfolio changes driven by changes in portfolio mix the aging of the portfolio and other risk factors all of which resulted in a 37 million reduction in the acl see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on how we determine the appropriate level of the alll and the rulc 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenue we earn from products and services that generally have no associated interest rate or yield and is classified as either customerrelated fees or noncustomerrelated revenue customerrelated fees exclude items such as securities gains and losses dividends insurancerelated income and marktomarket adjustments on certain derivatives 

total noninterest income increased 129 million or 22 in 2021 noninterest income accounted for 24 and 21 of net revenue during 2021 and 2020 respectively the following schedule presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income

schedule 9 

noninterest income 

1 wealth management fees for 2020 and 2019 included certain retirement servicerelated fees of 3 million in both periods beginning in 2021 those fees which totaled 4 million were reported in other customerrelated fees 

customerrelated fees 

customerrelated fee income growth is a result of our focus on our key corporate objectives by providing highquality treasury management products wealth management advisory services and capital market solutions we seek to deepen existing relationships with our commercial and small business customers 

total customerrelated fees increased 26 million or 5 in 2021 largely driven by improved customer transaction volume and new client activity during the year compared with the morestressed economic activity impacted by the covid19 pandemic in the prior year 

key drivers impacting customerrelated fees include 

• card fees increased 13 million or 16 in 2021 due to increased economic activity and transaction volume commercial account fees increased 9 million or 7 for similar reasons 

• wealth management fee income increased 6 million or 14 resulting from continued growth in assets and further adoption of wealth and advisory services from our customer base consequently our assets under management increased 23 billion or 26 to 110 billion at december 31 2021 which included meaningful increases in net new assets 

• loanrelated fees and income decreased 14 million or 13 in 2021 primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking income particularly lower margins on loan sales 

• capital markets and foreign exchange income decreased 4 million or 5 primarily due to reduced interest rate swap sales during the prior year as a result of the low interest rate environment many commercial customers purchased interest rate swaps from us to effectively fix the interest rate on their variablerate loans the decrease was partially offset by an increase in loan syndication fees 

noncustomerrelated revenue 

total noncustomerrelated revenue increased 103 million in 2021 primarily due to a 64 million increase in net securities gains and losses which was largely driven by net gains related to our sbic investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2021 we recognized a 31 million realized gain resulting from the sale of one of our sbic investments during 2021 we also recognized a net 23 million unrealized gain related to our investment in recursion pharmaceuticals inc which completed an initial public offering “ipo” in the second quarter of 2021 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

fair value and nonhedge derivative income increased 20 million due to recognized net gains related to credit valuation adjustments “cva” on clientrelated interest rate swaps compared with net cva losses in the prior year period the cva may fluctuate from period to period based on the credit quality of our clients and changes in interest rates which impact the value of and our credit exposure to the clientrelated interest rate swaps 

dividends and other income increased 19 million or 79 primarily due to a 12 million gain on sale of certain bankowned facilities during 2021 these sales related to the consolidation of a substantial portion of our technology and operations facilities in advance of occupying our new corporate technology center which is expected to be completed in mid2022 

noninterest expense 

the following schedule presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense 

schedule 10 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense increased 37 million or 2 in 2021 relative to the prior year primarily due to salaries and benefits expense which represented the largest component or 65 and 64 of total noninterest expense during the same time periods respectively the following schedule presents detail of the major segments of salaries and employee benefits expense 

schedule 11 

salaries and employee benefits 

salaries and benefits expense increased 40 million or 4 primarily due to inflationary and competitive labor pressures on wages and higher profit sharing expense as a result of improved profitability we had 9685 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2021 which remained relatively flat when compared with the prior year we believe that inflation and the competitive labor market may continue to impact our salaries and benefits expense 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

professional and legal services expense increased 16 million or 31 mainly due to various technologyrelated and other outsourced services related to our ongoing investment in our core technology systems 

other noninterest expense decreased 24 million or 10 primarily due to higher expenses in the prior year including a 30 million charitable contribution compared with 10 million in 2021 and a 28 million pension terminationrelated expense in 2020 the decrease in expense was partially offset by an increase of 14 million in software licenses and maintenance and a 7 million increase in success fee accruals associated with net gains on our sbic investments in 2021 

adjusted noninterest expense increased 64 million or 4 primarily due to the increases in noninterest expense previously discussed the efficiency ratio was 608 compared with 594 for information on nongaap financial measures including differences between noninterest expense and adjusted noninterest expense see page 22 

income taxes 

the following schedule summarizes the income tax expense and effective tax rates for the periods presented 

schedule 12 

income taxes 



the income tax rates for the tax years presented above were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance “boli” and were increased by the nondeductibility of fdic premiums certain executive compensation and other fringe benefits the tax rate for 2020 was also reduced as a result of the proportional increase in nontaxable items and tax credits relative to pretax book income as compared with 2021 and 2019 our investments in technology initiatives lowincome housing and municipal securities during 2021 2020 and 2019 generated tax credits and nontaxable income that benefited the tax rate for each respective year 

we had a net deferred tax asset “dta” of 96 million at december 31 2021 compared with a net deferred tax liability “dtl” of 3 million at december 31 2020 the increase to a dta from a dtl resulted primarily from an increase in unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” associated with investment securities and the capitalization of expenses related to intangible assets and was partially offset by significant negative provisions for credit losses during 2021 

we had no valuation allowance at december 31 2021 see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about the factors that impacted our effective tax rate significant components of our dtas and dtls and our assessment of any potential additional valuation allowances 

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock dividends totaled 29 million in 2021 and 34 million in both 2020 and 2019 the decrease in preferred dividends was due to the redemption of the outstanding shares of our series h preferred stock during the second quarter of 2021 see further details in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

risk management 

risk management is an integral part of our operations and is a key determinant of our overall performance we utilize the three lines of defense approach to risk management with responsibilities for each line of defense defined in our risk management framework the first line of defense represents units and functions throughout the bank engaged in activities related to revenue generation expense reduction operational support and technology services these units and functions are accountable for owning and managing the risks associated with these activities the second line of defense represents functions responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risk management activities the third line of defense is our internal audit function that provides independent assessment of the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defense 

in support of managements efforts the board has established certain committees to oversee our risk management processes the audit committee oversees financial reporting risk and the risk oversight committee “roc” oversees the other risk management processes the roc meets on a regular basis to monitor and review enterprise risk management “erm” activities as required by its charter the roc provides oversight for various erm activities and approves erm policies and activities as detailed in the roc charter 

we employ various strategies to reduce the risks to which our operations are exposed including credit risk market and interest rate risk liquidity risk strategic and business risk operational risk technology risk cyber risk capitalfinancial reporting risk legalcompliance risk including regulatory risk and reputational risk these risks are overseen by various management committees of which the enterprise risk management committee is the focal point

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

the board through the roc is responsible for approving the overall credit policies relating to the management of credit risk the roc also oversees and monitors adherence to key credit policies and the credit risk appetite as defined in the risk management framework the board has delegated responsibility for managing credit risk and approving changes to credit policies to the chief credit officer who chairs the credit risk committee 

credit policies credit risk management and credit examination functions inform and support the oversight of credit risk our credit policies emphasize strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate potential losses these formal credit policies and procedures provide us with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level 

our credit policies and practices are also designed to help manage potential risks including those arising from environmental issues environmental risk related to our lending practices is primarily covered in our environmental credit policy and by our environmental subject matter experts and manager the extent of environmental due diligence performed by our environmental risk team is based on the risks identified at each property and the loan amount the extension of credit to certain borrowers or those connected with certain activities may be restricted or require escalated approval by policy because of various environmental risks 

our credit risk management function is separate from the lending function and strengthens control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities in addition we have a welldefined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio and we utilize a comprehensive loan riskgrading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio 

the internal credit examination department which is independent of the lending function periodically conducts examinations of our lending departments and credit activities these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan riskgrading administration and compliance with credit policies credit examinations related to the acl are reported to both the audit committee and the roc 

our overall credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio our business activity is conducted primarily within the geographic footprint of our banking affiliates we seek to avoid the risk of undue concentrations of credit in any particular industry collateral type location or with any individual customer or counterparty we have certain significant concentrations including cre and oil and gasrelated lending we have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on leveraged lending municipal lending oil and gasrelated lending and various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending concentration limits are regularly monitored and revised as necessary

at december 31 2021 our cre construction and land development and term loan portfolios represented approximately 24 of the total loan portfolio the majority of our cre loans are secured by real estate which is primarily located within our geographic footprint approximately 19 of the cre loan portfolio matures in the next 12 months construction and land development loans generally mature in 18 to 36 months and contain full or partial recourse guarantee structures with one to fiveyear extension options or rolltoperm options that often result in term debt term cre loans generally mature within a three to sevenyear period and consist of full partial and nonrecourse guarantee structures typical term cre loan structures include annually tested operating covenants that require loan rebalancing based on minimum debt service coverage debt yield or loantovalue tests 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

approximately 160 million or 6 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2021 consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects 

underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with significant consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor consideration of projected cash flows is critical when underwriting commercial properties as these cash flows ultimately support a project’s debt service therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily and hospitality construction projects we require substantial preleasing or leasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan consideration is also given to the expected market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower generally by our internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed a new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness 

advance rates will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and homes not under contract and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement 

the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when evaluating cre loans for expected losses if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our expected loss methodology takes this repayment source into consideration 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend credit the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements tax returns leverage liquidity brokerage confirmations global cash flow global debt service coverage and contingent liabilities the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to

support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may ultimately reduce the level of allowance we estimate 

in the event of default we pursue any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared with the ultimate amount we may be able to recover 

consumer loans 

we generally originate firstlien residential home mortgages considered to be of prime quality we typically hold variablerate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixedrate loans to third parties including federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards 

we also originate home equity credit lines “hecl” at december 31 2021 and 2020 our hecl portfolio totaled 30 billion and 27 billion respectively the following schedule presents the composition of our hecl portfolio by lien status 

schedule 24 

hecl portfolio by lien status 



at december 31 2021 loans representing less than 1 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue “cltv” ratios above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateralvalue at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores 

approximately 90 of our hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 19 of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years we believe the risk of loss and borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the effect of significant interest rate changes is minimal the ratio of hecl net chargeoffs for the trailing twelve months to average balances at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 001 for both periods see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit quality of the hecl portfolio 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned “oreo” decreased to 053 at december 31 2021 compared with 069 at december 31 2020 

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2021 decreased to 271 million from 367 million reflecting credit quality improvements across most of our loan portfolios 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on nonaccrual loans

troubled debt restructured loans 

loans may be modified in the normal course of business for competitive reasons or to strengthen our collateral position loan modifications and restructurings may also occur when the borrower experiences financial difficulty and needs temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties and for which we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider are classified as troubled debt restructurings “tdrs” tdrs totaled 326 million at december 31 2021 compared with 311 million at december 31 2020 modifications that qualified for applicable accounting and regulatory exemptions for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties exclusively related to the covid19 pandemic were not classified and reported as tdrs 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether a loan is returned to accrual status 

schedule 26 

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 

in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs

allocation of the allowance for credit losses 

the total acl decreased 282 million during 2021 primarily due to improvements in economic forecasts and credit quality compared with the economic stress caused by the covid19 pandemic in the prior year period due to the adoption of the cecl standard in 2020 the acl is not comparable to periods presented prior to that time 

the rulc represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet loan commitments and standby letters of credit and decreased 18 million during 2021 the reserve is separately recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in “other liabilities” and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are recorded on the consolidated income statement in “provision for unfunded lending commitments”

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other ratesensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixedincome securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving various financial products we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

our board approves the overall policies relating to the management of our financial risk including interest rate and market risk management the board has delegated the responsibility of managing our interest rate and market risk to the assetliability committee “alco” which consists of members of management alco establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews with the roc the limits and limit exceptions reported by management 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed we strive to position the bank for interest rate changes and manage the balance sheet sensitivity to reduce net interest income volatility we generally have granular stable deposit funding much of this funding has an indeterminate life with no maturity and can be withdrawn at any time however because most deposits come from household and business accounts their duration is generally long compared with the short duration of our loan portfolio as such we are naturally “assetsensitive” — meaning that our assets are expected to reprice faster or more significantly than our liabilities in previous interest rate environments we have added 1 interest rate swaps to synthetically increase the duration of the loan portfolio 2 longerduration securities and 3 longerduration loans to reduce the asset sensitivity to a level where an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in only a slightly positive change in net interest income during the covid19 pandemic with shortterm interest rates at or near zero we judged the riskreward profile to be in favor of allowing the balance sheet to become significantly more assetsensitive we increased our investment securities portfolio during 2021 and added interest rate swaps in part to prevent the bank from becoming even more assetsensitive 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

asset sensitivity to rising rates is dependent upon assumptions we use for deposit runoff and repricing behavior as rapid growth in new deposits has led to more uncertainty in future behavior these assumptions have become more significant average total deposits increased 20 from the prior year and a significant portion of the deposits were invested in money market investments resulting in increased asset sensitivity to rising rates we are less assetsensitive to declining rates than rising rates due to the limited amount of compression that could occur between the spread of the cost of deposits and the yield on money market investments 

the following schedule presents derivatives utilized in our assetliability management activities that are designated in qualifying hedging relationships at december 31 2021 included are the average outstanding derivative notional amounts for each period presented and the weighted average fixedrate paid or received for each category of cash flow and fair value hedge 

schedule 30 

derivatives designated in qualifying hedging relationships 



1 cash flow hedges consist of receivefixed swaps hedging pools of floatingrate loans increases in the average outstanding notional are due to forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

2 fair value debt hedges consist of receivefixed swaps hedging fixedrate debt the 500 million fair value debt hedge matures at the end of july 2029 

3 fair value assets hedges consist of payfixed swaps hedging afs fixedrate securities 

interest rate risk measurement 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods net interest income simulation or earnings at risk “ear” and economic value of equity at risk “eve” ear measures the expected change in nearterm one year net interest income in response to changes in interest rates eve measures the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates 

ear is an estimate of the change in total net interest income that would be recognized under different interest rate environments over a oneyear period this simulated impact to net interest income due to a change in rates uses as its base a modeled net interest income that is not necessarily the same as the most recent year’s reported net interest income rather ear employs estimated net interest income under an unchanged interest rate scenario as the basis for comparison the ear process then simulates changes to the base net interest income under several interest rate scenarios including parallel and nonparallel interest rate shifts across the yield curve taking into account deposit repricing assumptions and estimates of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio eg a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lowerrate environment the ear model does not contemplate 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

changes in fee income that are amortized into interest income eg premiums discounts origination points and costs etc 

eve is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities we measure changes in the dollar amount of eve for parallel shifts in interest rates due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in eve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney interest rate caps or limits on loans which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for lowrate mortgages in a higherrate environment 

estimating the impact on net interest income and eve requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration eg customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit competitive pricing eg existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates loan and security prepayments and the effects of other embedded options as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans we also calculate the sensitivity of ear and eve results to key assumptions as previously noted most of our liabilities are comprised of indeterminate maturity and managedrate deposits such as checking savings and money market accounts and therefore the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for these deposits and to prepayment assumptions used for assets with prepayment options we use historical regression analysis as a guide for setting such assumptions however due to the current lowinterestrate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit behavior may not reflect actual future results additionally competition for funding in the marketplace may produce changes to deposit pricing on interestbearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates or the federal funds rate 

under most rising interest rate scenarios we would expect some customers to move balances from demand deposits to interestbearing accounts such as money market savings or certificates of deposit the models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration 

in addition we assume a correlation often referred to as a “deposit beta” with respect to interestbearing deposits wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared with changes in average benchmark interest rates generally certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation while interestonchecking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation actual results may differ materially due to factors including the shape of the yield curve competitive pricing money supply our credit worthiness and so forth however we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions 

the migration and correlation assumptions previously discussed result in deposit durations presented in the following schedule 

schedule 31 

deposit assumptions 



with interest rates forecast to rise more the effective duration of deposits has shortened due to higher expected runoff andor migration to more rate sensitive deposit products 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

incorporating the assumptions previously discussed the following schedule presents ear or percentage change in net interest income and our estimated percentage change in eve both ear and eve are based on a static balance sheet size under parallel interest rate changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

schedule 32 

income simulation – change in net interest income and change in economic value of equity 

1 assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift 

for nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 26 if the weighted average deposit beta were to increase 11 the ear in the 100 bps rate shock would change from 112 to 90 

the asset sensitivity as measured by ear increased in 2021 primarily due to growth in demand deposits and money market investments the ear analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of rates the yield curve typically does not move in a parallel manner if we consider a steepener rate ramp where the shortterm rate declines to zero but the tenyear rate moves to 200 bps the increase in ear is 595 less over 24 months compared with the parallel 200 bps rate ramp 

in the 100 bps rate shock the eve would increase due to the fact that we cap the value of our indeterminate deposits at their par value or equivalently we assume no premium would be required to dispose of these liabilities given that depositors could be repaid at par since our assets increase in value as rates fall and the majority of our liabilities are indeterminate deposits eve increases disproportionately the changes in eve measures from december 31 2020 are primarily driven by the behavior of the deposit models 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of our assetliability management posture at december 31 2021 22 billion of our commercial lending and cre loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate loans approximately 98 are tied to either the prime rate libor or ameribor for these variablerate loans we have executed 31 billion of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps additionally asset sensitivity is reduced due to 6 billion of variablerate commercial and cre loans being priced at floored rates at december 31 2021 which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 54 bps at december 31 2021 we also had 3 billion of variablerate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months and approximately 1 billion were priced at floored rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 31 bps see notes 3 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

libor exposure 

libor is being phased out globally and us banking regulators instructed banks to cease entering into new lending arrangements using libor no later than december 31 2021 and migrate to alternative reference rates no later than june 2023 to facilitate the transition process we instituted an enterprisewide program to identify assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of libor which includes active engagement with industry working groups and regulators this program also includes active involvement of senior management with regular engagement from the enterprise risk management committee and seeks to minimize client and internal business operational impacts while providing reporting transparency consistency and a central governance model that aligns with financial accounting standards board “fasb” internal revenue service “irs” and other regulatory guidance 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

we have implemented processes procedures and systems to ensure contract risk is sufficiently mitigated new originations and any modifications or renewals of liborbased contracts contain fallback language to ensure transition to an alternative reference rate for our contracts that referenced libor and had a duration beyond december 31 2021 all fallback provisions and variations were identified and classified based upon those provisions during 2021 we originated more nonlibor referenced loans than libor referenced loans and by the end of the year we had discontinued substantially all new originations referencing libor 

we have a significant number of assets and liabilities that reference libor at december 31 2021 we had approximately 33 billion in loans mainly commercial loans unfunded lending commitments and securities referencing libor the amount of borrowed funds referencing libor at december 31 2021 was less than 1 billion these amounts exclude derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2021 the notional amount of our liborreferenced interest rate derivative contracts was more than 18 billion of which more than 14 billion related to contracts with central counterparty clearinghouses 

the adoption of alternative reference rates continues to evolve in the marketplace we are positioned to support our customers’ needs by accommodating multiple alternative reference rates including the constant maturity treasury rate “cmt” the federal home loan bank “fhlb” rate the american interbank offered rate “ameribor” the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” and the bloomberg short term bank yield index “bsby” during 2022 customers will be prompted to either voluntarily modify their contracts and migrate to a reference rate other than libor no later than june 2023 or be subject to the fallback provisions in their contracts voluntary modifications are expected to qualify for the available tax safeharbor provisions as allowed by irs guidance 

we expect that customers who voluntarily migrate to an alternative reference rate will do so by the end of year 2022 and we expect the remaining customers to move to an alternative rate index in accordance with the relevant fallback provisions in their contracts prior to june of 2023 

for more information on the transition from libor see risk factors on page 13 

market risk — fixed income 

we underwrite municipal and corporate securities we also trade municipal agency and us treasury securities this underwriting and trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixedincome securities 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had 372 million and 266 million of trading assets and 254 million and 61 million of securities sold not yet purchased respectively 

we are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value this includes market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2021 the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs securities decreased 336 million due largely to changes in the interest rate environment compared with a 229 million increase in the same prior year period 

market risk — equity investments 

through our equity investment activities we own equity securities that are publicly traded in addition we own equity securities in governmental entities and companies eg federal reserve bank and the fhlb that are not publicly traded equity investments may be accounted for at cost fair value the equity method or full consolidation methods of accounting depending on our ownership position and degree of influence over the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation because the fair value of these securities may fall below the cost at which we acquired them we are exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by our equity investments committee consisting of members of management 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

we hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly prepublic companies primarily through various sbic venture capital funds our equity exposure to these investments was approximately 179 million and 135 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively on occasion some of the companies within our sbic investments may issue an ipo in this case the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment which can introduce additional market risk during 2021 we recognized a 31 million realized gain resulting from the sale of one of our sbic investments and a net 23 million unrealized gain related to our investment in recursion pharmaceuticals inc which completed an ipo in the second quarter of 2021 see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the valuation of our sbic investments 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity refers to our ability to meet our cash contractual and collateral obligations and to manage both expected and unexpected cash flows without adversely impacting our operations or financial strength sources of liquidity include deposits borrowings equity and unencumbered assets such as marketable loans and investment securities 

since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously described risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds for our customers’ credit needs capital plan actions anticipated financial and contractual obligations which include withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardapproved corporate liquidity policy this policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines such as a 30day liquidity coverage ratio that are used to monitor our liquidity positions as well as our various stress test and liquid asset measurements we perform liquidity stress tests and assess our portfolio of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under stress scenarios at december 31 2021 our investment securities portfolio of 249 billion and cash and money market investments of 130 billion collectively comprised 41 of total assets 

our treasury group under the direction of the corporate treasurer manages our liquidity and funding with oversight by alco the treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans and our policies related to liquidity and funding these recommendations are submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policies are also approved by the ermc and the board we have adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk the policy requires us to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows in the event of a severe liquidity crisis we complied with this policy throughout 2021 

liquidity regulation 

we perform liquidity stress tests and assess our portfolio of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under the stress scenarios even though we are no longer subject to the enhanced prudential standards for liquidity management reg yy in addition we exceed the regulatory requirements that mandate a buffer of securities and other liquid assets to cover 70 of 30day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated therein although we are no longer subject to the regulations of the final lcr rule 

liquidity management actions 

our consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements were 129 billion at december 31 2021 compared with 73 billion at december 31 2020 during 2021 the primary sources of cash came from significant increases in deposits redemptions and sales of investment securities and net cash provided by operating activities uses of cash during the same period included primarily increases in investment securities and money market investments repurchases of our common stock and a decrease in shortterm borrowings 

total deposits were 828 billion at december 31 2021 compared with 697 billion at december 31 2020 the 131 billion increase during 2021 was a result of an 86 billion and 55 billion increase in noninterestbearing 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

demand deposits and savings and money market deposits respectively partially offset by a 10 billion decrease in time deposits an increase in the money supply contributed meaningfully to overall deposit growth our core deposits consisting of noninterestbearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits and time deposits under 250000 were 819 billion at december 31 2021 compared with 682 billion at december 31 2020 

at december 31 2021 maturities of our longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from march 2022 to october 2029 during 2021 we redeemed 281 million of senior debt which matured and was not replaced with a new debt issuance in february 2022 we redeemed 290 million of the 4year 335 senior notes on the contractual call date one month prior to final maturity 

our cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses decreased to 81 million during 2021 from 195 million during 2020 primarily due to lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds and a decreased balance of fed funds and other shortterm borrowings additionally we paid approximately 263 million of dividends on preferred and common stock during 2021 compared with 259 million during 2020 dividends paid per common share were 144 in 2021 compared with 136 in 2020 in january 2022 the board approved a quarterly common dividend of 038 per share 

general financial market and economic conditions impact our access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings all of the credit rating agencies rate our debt at an investmentgrade level and they recently improved their outlook kroll from stable to positive fitch and sp from negative to stable and moody’s from stable to review for upgrade our credit ratings and outlooks are presented in the following schedule 

schedule 33 

credit ratings 



the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and continue to be a significant source of additional liquidity and funding we are a member of the fhlb of des moines which allows member banks to borrow against eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements we are required to invest in fhlb and federal reserve stock to maintain our borrowing capacity at december 31 2021 our total investment in fhlb and federal reserve stock was 11 million and 81 million respectively compared with 11 million and 98 million at december 31 2020 

the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 183 billion at december 31 2021 compared with 171 billion at december 31 2020 loans with a carrying value of approximately 268 billion at december 31 2021 have been pledged at the fhlb of des moines and the federal reserve as collateral for current and potential borrowings compared with 247 billion at december 31 2020 at both december 31 2021 and 2020 we had no fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding 

our afs investment securities are primarily held as a source of contingent liquidity we target securities that can be easily turned into cash through sale or repurchase agreements and whose value remains relatively stable during market disruptions we manage our shortterm funding needs through secured borrowing with the securities pledged as collateral our afs securities balances increased 83 billion during 2021 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

our loantototal deposit ratio was 61 at december 31 2021 compared with 77 at december 31 2020 reflecting higher deposit growth in 2021 with deposit growth driving our increase in funding liquidity considerations are highly dependent on the future behavior of deposit growth by primarily deploying excess funds in liquid securities and money market investments we retain the ability to address changes to our funding or liquidity profile 

borrowed funds both short and longterm decreased by 993 million during 2021 as deposit growth exceeded loan demand we used deposit funding to increase money market investments and investment securities which increased 56 billion and 82 billion respectively during 2021 

we may from time to time issue additional preferred stock senior or subordinated notes or other forms of capital or debt instruments depending on our capital funding assetliability management or other needs as market conditions warrant these additional issuances may be subject to required regulatory approvals we believe that our sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably foreseeable short and intermediateterm demands 

contractual obligations 

the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2021 

schedule 34 

contractual obligations 

1 indeterminable maturity deposits include noninterestbearing demand savings and money market deposits 

2 commitments to make venture and other noninterestbearing investments do not have defined maturity dates they are due upon demand and may be drawn immediately therefore these commitments are shown as having indeterminable maturities 

3 the values presented do not reflect the associated hedges 

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in the schedule above we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business some of these contracts are renewable or cancellable annually or in shorter time intervals to secure favorable pricing concessions we may also commit to contracts that may extend several years 

we enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are measured at fair value on the balance sheet reflecting the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market interest rates see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts

cyber risk is the risk of adverse impacts to the confidentiality integrity and availability of data owned stored or processed by the bank the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our systems and those of our suppliers — sometimes referred to as hacking cyber fraud cyberattacks or other similar names — continues to grow to combat the everincreasing sophistication of cyberattacks we are continually improving methods for detecting and preventing attacks we have implemented policies and procedures developed specific training for our employees and have elevated our oversight and internal reporting to the board and relevant committees further we regularly engage independent thirdparty cyber experts to test for vulnerabilities in our environment we also conduct our own internal simulations and tabletop exercises as well as participate in financial sectorspecific exercises we have engaged consultants at both the strategic level and at the technology implementation level to assist us in better managing this critical risk cyber defense and improving our resiliency against cybersecurity threats remain a key focus at all levels of management and of our board 

capital management 

overview 

the board is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has delegated responsibility of managing our capital risk to the capital management committee “cmc” which is chaired by the chief financial officer consists of members of management and whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern our capital management other major cmc responsibilities include 

• setting overall capital targets within the boardapproved capital policy monitoring performance compared with our capital policy limits and recommending changes to capital including dividends common stock issuances and repurchases subordinated debt and changes in major strategies to maintain ourselves at wellcapitalized levels 

• maintaining an adequate capital cushion to withstand adverse stress events while continuing to meet the borrowing needs of our customers and to provide reasonable assurance of continued access to wholesale funding consistent with fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders and 

• reviewing our agency ratings 

a strong capital position is vital to the achievement of our key corporate objectives our continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence we have fundamental financial objectives and policies to consistently improve riskadjusted returns on our shareholders’ capital including 1 maintaining sufficient capital to support the current needs and growth of our businesses and 2 fulfilling responsibilities to depositors and bondholders while managing capital distributions to shareholders through dividends and repurchases of common stock under the national bank act and occ regulations certain capital transactions are subject to the approval of the occ 

we continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions which are comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the frb the timing and amount of capital actions are subject to various factors including our financial performance business needs prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and the results of our internal stress testing as well as board and occ approval shares may be repurchased occasionally in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions

shareholders equity 



total shareholders’ equity decreased 423 million or 5 to 75 billion at december 31 2021 an 866 million increase in retained earnings was offset by significant decreases in common stock and additional paidin capital aoci and preferred stock common stock and additional paidin capital decreased 758 million primarily due to common stock repurchases aoci decreased 405 million primarily due to decreases in the fair value of availableforsale securities as a result of changes in interest rates preferred stock decreased 126 million due to the redemption of the outstanding shares of our 575 series h noncumulative perpetual preferred stock at par value during the second quarter of 2021 

capital management actions 

weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 54 million in 2021 primarily due to common stock repurchases during 2021 we repurchased 135 million common shares outstanding for 800 million which is equivalent to 82 of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2020 in january 2022 the board approved a plan to repurchase up to 50 million of common shares outstanding during the first quarter of 2022 in february 2022 we repurchased 107559 common shares outstanding for 75 million at an average price of 6973 

schedule 36 

capital distributions 



under the occ’s “earnings limitation rule” our dividend payments are restricted to an amount equal to the sum of the total of 1 our net income for that year and 2 retained earnings for the preceding two years unless the occ approves the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount as of january 1 2022 we had 11 billion of retained net profits available for distribution 

the common stock dividend was 038 per share during the second half of 2021 compared with 034 during the first half of the year and the prior year we paid common dividends of 232 million in 2021 compared with 225 million in 2020 in january 2022 the board declared a quarterly dividend of 038 per common share payable on

february 24 2022 to shareholders of record on february 17 2022 we also paid dividends on preferred stock of 29 million in 2021 compared with 34 million in 2020 

cecl 

we elected to phasein the regulatory capital effects of the adoption of cecl as allowed by federal bank agencies and as described in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on december 31 2021 the twoyear deferral period for any adverse effect from cecl on regulatory capital expired the application of these provisions had no impact on our cet1 tier 1 riskbased total riskbased capital and tier 1 leverage capital ratios at december 31 2021 and therefore will not have any phasein impact to our capital ratios over the next three years 

basel iii 

we are subject to basel iii capital requirements to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2021 we met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules based on our internal stress testing and other assessments of capital adequacy we believe we hold capital sufficiently in excess of internal and regulatory requirements for wellcapitalized banks 

the following schedule presents our capital and other performance ratios the supervision and regulation section on page 6 and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contain more information about basel iii capital requirements 

schedule 37 

capital ratios 



1 see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 22 for more information regarding these ratios 

at december 31 2021 basel iii regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital was 65 billion and 77 billion respectively compared with 66 billion and 79 billion respectively at december 31 2020 

our tier 1 leverage ratio declined to 72 from 83 and has become more relevant in our capital adequacy assessments deployment of depositdriven balance sheet growth into lower riskweighted assets during the year has resulted in a modest reduction in our riskweighted regulatory capital ratios and a larger reduction in the tier 1 leverage ratio as the denominator for this ratio is not adjusted for risk 

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies described below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to our financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording our financial transactions is important to have a complete picture of our financial 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and related estimates with the audit committee of the board 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

allowance for credit losses 

the acl includes the alll and the rulc and represents our estimate of current expected credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments as of the balance sheet date the acl for our securities portfolio is estimated separately from loans 

on january 1 2020 we adopted asu 201613 or cecl upon adoption of the asu we recorded the full amount of the acl for loans and leases of 526 million resulting in an aftertax increase to retained earnings of 20 million the impact of the adoption of cecl for our securities portfolio was less than 1 million 

the cecl allowance is calculated based on quantitative models and management qualitative judgment based on many factors over the life of loan the primary assumptions of the cecl quantitative model are the economic forecast the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period the length of the reversion period prepayment rates and the credit quality of the portfolio 

as a result of the cecl accounting standard the acl may change significantly each period because under the cecl methodology the acl is subject to economic forecasts that may change materially from period to period although we believe that our methodology for determining an appropriate level for the acl adequately addresses the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses 

for example if the acl was evaluated on the baseline economic scenario rather than probability weighting four scenarios the quantitatively determined amount of the acl at december 31 2021 would decrease by approximately 82 million additionally if the probability of default risk grade for all passgraded loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal riskgrading scale the quantitatively determined amount of the acl at december 31 2021 would increase by approximately 40 million these sensitivity analyses are hypothetical and have been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in economic forecasts and changes in risk grades may have on the acl estimate see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the processes and methodologies used to estimate the acl 

fair value estimates 

we measure many of our assets and liabilities at fair value fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements gaap has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as our own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than the carrying value of the item being valued considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities measured at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs when available and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available we are required to make judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously described 

afs securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors afs securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of impairment if we have an intent to sell an identified security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis we first recognize an identified impairment if we do not have the intent to sell a security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell a security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis then we determine whether there is any impairment attributable to creditrelated factors 

notes 1 3  5 7 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the “investment securities portfolio” on page 43 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded at fair value in the financial statements of a reporting unit at the time of its acquisition and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this annual test at the beginning of the fourth quarter or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of our reporting units inclusive of goodwill is less than fair value the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount inclusive of goodwill is more likely than not to exceed its fair value additional quantitative analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any of goodwill impairment our reporting units with goodwill are amegy cbt and zions bank 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we historically have used a combination of up to three separate quantitative methods comparable publiclytraded commercial banks in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of commercial banks in the western and 

table of con tents 

zions bancorporation national association 

southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows 

critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations may include 

• selection of comparable publiclytraded companies based on location size and business focus and composition 

• selection of market comparable acquisition transactions if available based on location size business focus and composition and date of the transaction 

• the discount rate which is based on our estimate of the cost of equity capital 

• the projections of future earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit 

• the relative weight given to the valuations derived by the three methods described and 

• the control premium associated with reporting units 

we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how we are managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within our geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that up to a 25 control premium for the reporting units is appropriate 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment test computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on our reporting units fair value and the goodwill impairment amount if any estimates include economic conditions which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect our regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation effective october 1 2021 we concluded that none of our reporting units were impaired during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed a full quantitative analysis and determined that the fair values of zions bank cbt and amegy exceeded their carrying values by 44 28 and 12 respectively as part of the quantitative analysis we also performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings was increased by 100 bps the fair values of zions bank cbt and amegy would exceed their carrying values by 39 24 and 9 respectively 

recent accounting pronouncements and developments

branches at yearend 2020 we had 9678 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2020 at year end we had a strong capital position with a common equity tier 1 “cet1” capital to total riskweighted assets ratio of 108 when combined with our allowance for credit losses “acl” this ratio was one of the highest among peer banks 

we conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed “affiliates” or “affiliate banks” each with its own local branding and management team these affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document we emphasize local authority and responsibility local pricing and customization of certain products as applicable designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations for further information about our segments see “business segment results” on page 46 in mda and note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we are focused on the communities in our geographic footprint as well as providing banking services to businesses and their owners and executives in those communities with whom relationships are particularly important our experienced bankers develop longlasting relationships with our customers by providing valuable advice and awardwinning service such relationships are further enhanced by many of the highquality digital products we offer building such relationships is essential to maintaining and improving upon our highquality deposit franchise currently we have one of the lowest costs of deposits and one of the highest proportions of noninterestbearing demand deposits among peer banks

• commercial real estate banking 

• municipal and public finance services 

• retail banking including residential mortgages 

• trust services 

• wealth management and private client banking and 

• capital markets products and services 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks credit unions and thrifts including financial institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit business via the internet and other means in addition we compete with finance companies mutual fund companies insurance companies brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies financial technology and other nontraditional lending and banking companies and a variety of other types of companies these companies may have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary components of our business that we believe differentiate us from our competitors are the quality of service delivered our local community knowledge convenience of office locations online banking functionality and other delivery methods range of products offered pricing and the overall relationship with our clients we strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful 

supervision and regulation 

this section describes the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

regulations described changes in applicable laws or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted however they may have a material effect on our business and results 

on september 30 2018 we completed the merger of zions bancorporation our former holding company with and into zions bancorporation na sometimes referred to herein as the “restructuring” more information about the restructuring and its effects can be found in the proxy statement filed by zions bancorporation with the sec on july 24 2018 in connection with completing the restructuring we also received approval of an application filed with the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” seeking a determination that we are not “systemically important” as defined by provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers and taxpayers these regulations are not generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors and may have the consequence of reducing returns to our shareholders banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry which have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders 

legislative changes to laws governing the financial industry occur frequently some of this legislation materially affects the manner in which we and other financial institutions operate including increasing the costs and other burdens of conducting our businesses in addition the banking agencies regularly promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations which also have significant impact on the financial industry the content and impact of such regulatory changes cannot presently be determined we are committed to both satisfying regulatory expectations and providing attractive shareholder returns however given the everevolving regulatory environment the results of these efforts cannot yet be known 

general 

we are subject to the provisions of the national bank act and other statutes governing national banks as well as the rules and regulations of the occ the cfpb and the fdic we are also subject to examination and supervision by the occ and examination by the cfpb in respect of federal consumer financial regulations we as well as some of our subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies these regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and state securities regulators 

the national bank act 

prior to the restructuring zions bancorporation’s corporate affairs were governed by utah state law and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws including the securities act of 1933 “securities act” and the securities exchange act of 1934 “exchange act” as administered by the sec each of these legal frameworks is welldeveloped and used widely by public companies 

following the restructuring our corporate affairs are governed by the national bank act and related regulations administered by the occ with respect to securities matters we are not subject to the securities act but are subject to occ regulations governing securities offerings our common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the exchange act which vests the occ with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the exchange act applicable to banks though we continue to make filings required by the exchange act with the sec as a voluntary filer these statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as welldeveloped as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held corporations 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act and related regulations broadly affect the financial services industry among other things the doddfrank act involves mandatory divestiture of certain equity investments increased regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation increased bank fees to regulatory agencies and numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector regulations promulgated under the doddfrank 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

act require many banks to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets and adhere to the annual comprehensive capital analysis “ccar” process administered by the federal reserve bank “frb” as a result of the restructuring and fsoc approval we are no longer subject to these capital and ccar requirements however we continue to conduct internal stress testing and capital management measures that are similar to ccar requirements and remain subject to other regulatory requirements that may reduce our flexibility to return capital to shareholders and respond to other market developments and opportunities these regulatory requirements include the occ’s heightened standard guidelines which establish minimum standards for certain large insured financial institutions such as us for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework and for board oversight of such framework’s design and implementation 

we also remain subject to the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations that affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and the pricing of certain products and services including debit card interchange fees and the assessment base for federal deposit insurance among others 

the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining large financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws restricting the scope of federal preemption could burden national banks with the requirement that they also comply with certain state laws covering matters already covered by federal law in addition the doddfrank act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

we and other companies subject to the doddfrank act must adhere to requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation these restrictions include documentation and governance deferral riskbalancing and clawback requirements any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or engage in other activities or could result in regulatory enforcement actions 

capital standards – basel framework 

the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules among other things 1 introduced a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” 2 specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements 3 applied most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and 4 expanded the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared with prior regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratio requirements are as follows 

• 45 cet1 to riskweighted assets 

• 60 tier 1 capital ie cet1 plus additional tier 1 to riskweighted assets 

• 80 total capital ie tier 1 plus tier 2 to riskweighted assets and 

• 40 tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the “leverage ratio” 

the basel iii capital rules also require us to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of 1 cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 2 tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and 3 total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effect not reflected in net income 

the basel iii capital rules also prescribed a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expanded the riskweighting categories from basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures to 1250 for certain securitization exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules provided more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increased the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

on july 9 2019 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for “nonadvanced approach” banking organizations the final rule simplifies the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions the final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25 deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250 risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital 

as allowed under the basel iii capital rules we made a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to exclude the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” items in determining regulatory capital and capital ratios 

basel iii also required additional regulatory capital disclosures to be made that are commonly referred to as “pillar 3” disclosures these disclosures require us to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding our capital structure adequacy and riskweighted assets we began publishing these pillar 3 disclosures in 2015 and such disclosures are available on our website 

the basel committee has issued a series of updates that propose other changes to capital regulations in one of these the basel committee finalized a revised framework for calculating minimum capital requirements for market risk with an effective date for reporting under the revised framework for market risk capital of january 1 2022 we are currently not subject to the market risk capital rules as we do not engage in substantial trading activity the us federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these revisions for us banking organizations we met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules as of december 31 2020 

capital planning and stress testing 

we continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions the stress test results reflect a set of forwardlooking stress tests based upon hypothetical economic scenarios generated in conjunction with moodys analytics moody’s protracted slump scenario a downside 4 scenario is the primary stress scenario we considered for our internal stress scenario certain variables of which we adjusted to test certain idiosyncrasies that may be unique to us detailed disclosure of our historical internal stress test results can be found on our website the 2020 internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios reflective of the ongoing economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the results of the stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios at levels adequate for our risk profile throughout the ninequarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test 

liquidity 

historically reg ulation and monitoring of bank liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter both in the us and internationally without required formulaic measures however in january 2016 the frb and other banking regulators enacted final rules “final liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” rule” implementing a us version of the basel committee’s lcr requirement the lcr is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of securities and other liquid assets to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30day stress scenario the final lcr rule applies to large internationally active banking organizations those 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

with at least 250 billion in total assets or at least 10 billion in onbalance sheet foreign exposure while the final lcr rule does not apply to us we manage liquidity in accordance with the basel iii liquidity requirements furthermore we utilize internal liquidity stress tests as our primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including but not limited to holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets maintaining levels of readily available contingency funding concentrations of funding sources and maturity profile of liabilities 

financial privacy and cyber security 

the federal banking regulators have enacted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties including provisions of the grammleachbliley act which require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that is intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision although the joint proposal was withdrawn in early 2020 cybersecurity remains a regulatory priority and is likely to be the subject of future rulemaking 

state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have enacted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements in june 2018 the california legislature passed the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” which took effect on january 1 2020 on november 3 2020 the ccpa was amended and expanded by the approval of california ballot initiative proposition 24 known as the california privacy rights act the “cpra” the ccpa as amended covers businesses that obtain or access personal information on california residents grants them enhanced privacy rights and control over their personal information and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to individual data privacy rights some of the rights afforded to california residents also extend to california employees though the cpra amendments now exempt certain employee information and employer usage from some of the cpra provisions until at least january 1 2023 other states have implemented or are considering similar privacy laws we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate 

in may 2018 the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data of european union “eu” residents we believe the applicability of the gdpr to us is minimal as we do not offer goods or services to eu residents or monitor their behaviors data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly remain a focus of state and federal regulators and will continue to have a significant impact on our risk management practices 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia as modified 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

by the basel iii capital rules an insured depository institution will generally be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 in addition an insured depository institution will generally be classified as undercapitalized if its cet1 ratio is under 45 its total riskbased capital ratio is less than 8 its tier 1 riskbased capital ratio is less than 6 or its tier 1 leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator 

other regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the us and the states in which we and our subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

• limitations on dividends payable to shareholders our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

• safety and soundness standards prescribed in the fdicia including standards related to internal controls information systems internal audit loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies the safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in their supervisory authority over us 

• requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities and restrictions on other activities the national bank act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and do not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of a nonaffiliated nonbank see discussion under “ risk factors ” other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities 

• limits on bank organization activities which are more limited than activities that can be conducted by bank holding company organizations 

• limitations on the amount of loans to a borrower and its affiliates 

• limitations on transactions with affiliates as expanded by the doddfrank act 

• restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain securities 

• requirements for opening of branches and the acquisition of other financial entities 

• fair lending and truth in lending requirements to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions

• community reinvestment act “cra” requirements the cra requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities including providing credit to low and moderateincome individuals if we fail to adequately serve our communities penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates and merge with or purchase other financial institutions 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

• antimoney laundering regulations the bank secrecy act title iii of the uniting and strengthening of america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 “usa patriot act” and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist us government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering terrorist financing and other suspicious activity 

we are subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 certain provisions of the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information the national association of securities dealers automated quotations “nasdaq” has also enacted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

our board of directors has overseen management’s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk practices this system includes policies and guidelines such as corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of bank stock by insiders and charters for the executive audit risk oversight compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on our corporate governance practices is available on our website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom our website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

we have adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to us management monitors these laws and regulations and regularly reviews and updates its policies procedures and controls in anticipation of industry and regulatory changes 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on our future business and earnings results cannot be predicted 

government monetary and fiscal policies and actions 

our business and earnings results are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies enacted by various governmental authorities we are particularly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the frb including the current low level of both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit we are also affected by the actions of various governmental authorities in response to the economic effects of terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities natural disasters severe weather conditions and public health emergencies such as the economic stimulus programs included in the 2020 coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares” act resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of such policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on our business and earnings monetary fiscal and other policy initiatives and actions have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 

human capital management 

we are proud of our employees who bring their unique diverse talents to work each day our management and board value our employees and are committed to identifying recognizing and creating fulfilling opportunities for people within our organization and rewarding them for their contributions to our success 

covid19 has had a significant impact on how we work and the work we perform at the outset of the pandemic we quickly transitioned more than 70 of our employees to working remotely and implemented safety procedures 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

and policies to keep our branch employees as safe as possible while they performed essential inperson services we were also heavily involved in supporting customers with ppp loans rewarding employees directly involved in the effort with meaningful incentives and paying 1000 bonuses to all our employees with salaries less than 150000 for supporting this important effort 

our total fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2020 was 9678 a decrease of 5 from the prior year period the following schedule describes certain demographic attributes of our employees 

schedule 1 



we have an exceptional team of women senior leaders that was recognized as one of five “top teams” for 2020 in american banker magazine’s issue of the “most powerful women in banking and finance” this year marks the fifth time we have been honored as a top team additionally in the november 2020 issue of american banker magazine we were honored among 85 of the “best banks to work for in 2020” and we ranked sixth among large banks with assets greater than 10 billion we have been recognized on this list for all eight years of its existence 

we manage our human capital through the following programs and initiatives

we believe in an environment where people are respected and valued regardless of their differences along with a talented workforce that reflects our diverse communities we also believe that our performance is stronger when we are able to draw upon the talents and experience of a diverse team of employees 

our 2020 corporate responsibility report highlights several achievements in this area for example our banker development program college internship program and mentor program have significant participation from women and minorities 

throughout the organization employee business resource groups foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through forum meetings and discussions this includes groups for african americans hispaniclatinx lgbtqia and women among others these groups are open to all employees and offer networking and initiatives that support our commitment to diversity both internally and externally 

attracting and developing talent for longterm success 

we are committed to recruiting and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the markets we serve to helping our employees grow in their careers and to actively developing talent for future leadership opportunities as we attract and hire talent we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

high performance we provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk 

we routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender minority status and other factors these actions help us compensate employees fairly during 2020 we enlisted the services of an independent third party who found that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education experience and geography women are paid on average approximately 99 of what men are paid and minorities are paid approximately 98 of what nonminorities are paid in a relatively few cases we identified outlier situations that have been subsequently addressed 

our employees provide regular feedback through our robust listening strategy which includes quarterly leadership calls biannual employee opinion surveys and targeted focus groups these forums for employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals and reinforce our guiding principles and code of business conduct and ethics 

finally we value worklife balance and strive to create a work environment that supports our employees with mental physical social and financial wellness some of our key benefits include the following 

• corporate match for our 401k plan of 45 of earnings plus annual profitsharing contributions

• adoption assistance program and 

• company paid time off for charitable contributions to our giving campaign and volunteer opportunities 




 item 1a risk factors 

our growth strategy is driven by key factors while adhering to defined risk parameters the key elements of our strategy reflect our prudent risktaking philosophy we generate revenue by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks these factors are outlined in our risk management framework 

our board of directors has established an audit committee a compensation committee and a risk oversight committee of the board approved a risk management framework and appointed an enterprise risk management committee “ermc” to oversee and implement the risk management framework the ermc is comprised of senior management and is chaired by the chief risk officer our most material risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in extensions of credit to relationship customers in addition to credit risk these committees also monitor the following level one risk areas market and interest rate risk liquidity risk strategic and business risk operational risk technology risk cyber risk capitalfinancial reporting risk legalcompliance risk including regulatory risk and reputational risk as outlined in our risk taxonomy although not a specific risk identified in our risk taxonomy an additional risk factor related to the covid19 pandemic has been added below additional governance and oversight include boardapproved policies and management committees with direct focus on these specific risk categories 

although not comprehensive the following describes several risk factors that are material to us 

credit risk 

credit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks a decline in the strength of the us economy in general or the local economies in which we conduct operations could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the acl 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

we have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio including loans secured by real estate oil and gasrelated lending and leveraged and enterprise value lending which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results 

concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect us concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to us due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk 

we engage in commercial term real estate lending as well as construction and land acquisition and development lending primarily in our western states footprint we also have a concentration in oil and gasrelated lending primarily in texas both commercial real estate “cre” and oil and gasrelated lending are subject to specific risks including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateral values and activity levels because our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states collateral values in that area may behave differently than in other parts of the us we may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the us 

we provide a wide range of banking products and related services through our local management teams and unique brands in arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah washington and wyoming approximately 74 of our total net interest income relates to our banking operations in utahidaho texas and california for both of the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively as a result of this geographic concentration our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results for example our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events at december 31 2020 loan balances associated with our banking operations in utahidaho texas and california comprised 76 of our commercial lending portfolio 73 of the cre lending portfolio and 70 of the consumer lending portfolio 

we could be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

adverse economic conditions negatively affect our business including our loan and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition most recently the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainties and disruptions in the us and global economies including widespread effects on our customers business financial results and overall condition these conditions have adversely affected and may continue to affect some of our customers ability to make timely payments on obligations particularly in industries hard hit by the pandemic such as hospitality retail and commercial real estate pandemic conditions have also reduced certain types of fee income due to reduced loan origination activity and credit card spending government stimulus and other programs designed to support the us and global economies during the pandemic which have provided additional liquidity to individuals and small businesses and have contributed to increased deposits may be discontinued or may not be sufficient to improve these conditions any sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions would adversely affect us 

for information about how we manage credit risk see “credit risk management” on page 55 in mda 

market and interest rate risk 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect our results 

net interest income is the largest component of our revenue a prolonged period of low interest rates such as the one that exists today has a materially adverse impact on our net interest income and results in declining net interest margins interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability management committee factors beyond our control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase our risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

regulatory agencies in particular the frb as interest rates on earning assets decline our cost of funds may not decline commensurately 

some components of our balance sheet are very sensitive to rising and falling rates on an ongoing basis we use various strategies to manage our interest rate risk such as entering into interest rate swaps caps and floors 

interest rates on our financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to libor which could adversely impact our revenue expenses and value of those financial instruments 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority regulating libor along with various other regulatory bodies announced that libor would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021 libor makes up the most liquid and common interest rate index in the world and is commonly referenced in financial instruments we have exposure to libor in a variety of our financial contracts instruments that may be impacted include loans securities and derivatives among other financial contracts indexed to libor and that mature after december 31 2021 

while there is no consensus on what reference rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to libor in may 2018 the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of us financial market participants selected by the federal reserve bank of new york started to publish the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as an alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by treasury securities that was selected by the alternative reference rates committee due to the depth and robustness of the us treasury repurchase market at this time it is not certain whether sofr will become an accepted alternative to libor especially for the types of commercial loans that constitute a major portion of our loan portfolio 

the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate such as sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could 

• adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the value of our floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments indexed to libor or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s dominant role in determining market interest rates globally 

• result in a replacement rate for libor that does not adjust for changes in the credit environment and does not have a term structure 

• prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators with respect to our preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate 

• result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased loans and securities and 

• require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark such as sofr 

the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain 

for further information about how we manage libor market and interest rate risk see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 67 in mda 

liquidity risk 

we and the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned to us by rating agencies and particular classes of securities that we issue the rates we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we and our securities receive from 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

recognized rating agencies ratings downgrades to us or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our liquidity position financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

changes in sources of liquidity and capital and liquidity requirements may limit our operations and potential growth 

our primary source of liquidity is our supply of deposits from our customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customers maintaining those deposits with us while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for changes in our deposit funding marketrelated forces and a wide variety of other events could impact the liquidity value we derive from our deposits 

liquidity requirements and sources are also subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the occ and the fdic including riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements as well as basel iii liquidity requirements tailored to institutions with assets under 100 billion 

for information about how we manage liquidity risk see “liquidity risk management” on page 73 in mda 

strategic and business risk 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the soundness and stability of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us information security and vendor management processes are in place to actively identify manage and monitor actual and potential impacts 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

bank regulatory agencies have published regulations and guidance that limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

we have made and are continuing to make significant changes that include among other things organizational restructurings efficiency initiatives and replacement or upgrades of certain core technology systems to improve our control environment and operating efficiency the ultimate success and completion of these changes and their effect on us may vary significantly from initial planning which could materially adversely affect us 

over the last several years we have completed numerous improvement projects including the merger of our bank holding company into the bank combining the legal charters of our seven affiliate banks into one consolidating 15 loan operations sites into two replacing our core loan systems upgrading our accounting systems installing a credit origination work flow system streamlining our small business and retail lending mortgage wealth management and foreign exchange businesses and investing in data quality and information security ongoing investment continues in a multiyear project to replace our core deposit systems a collection of customerfacing digital capabilities and a variety of other projects to simplify how we do business 

these initiatives and changes continue to be implemented and are in various stages of completion by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings expected efficiencies and related items are subject to change and significant variability there can be no certainty that we will achieve the expected benefits or other intended results associated with these projects 

we may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these projects these 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

may include significant time delays cost overruns loss of key people technological problems processing failures and other adverse developments we may also experience operational disruptions failure or capacity constraints due to the performance level of concentration replacement costs and our dependence on thirdparty vendors any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems processes control environment procedures and employees which may adversely impact our customers and our ability to conduct business 

we have plans controls policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these potential adverse developments however there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately remediated the ultimate effect of any adverse development could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect us including our control environment operating efficiency and results of operations 

operational risk 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods prolonged drought and pandemics may adversely affect us and the general economy financial and capital markets and specific industries 

we have significant operations and a significant customer base in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods prolonged droughts and other weatherrelated events these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy our business and customers and have posed physical risks to our property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on us and our customers although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place a significant catastrophic event could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

we have established internal controls over financial reporting and other operations because of their inherent limitations internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of us we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring operational soundness and compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations these efforts also include the management of controls to mitigate operational risks for programs and processes across the bank 

we could be adversely affected by internal as well as external fraud schemes 

we have systems and procedures in place to monitor our operations and to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud by both internal and external actors we also mitigate certain of these risks through the purchase of insurance however there can be no certainty that we will identify prevent or otherwise mitigate all instances of fraud that have the potential to result in material losses 

we use models in the management of the bank there is risk that these models are inaccurate in various ways which can cause us to make suboptimal decisions 

we attempt to carefully develop document back test and validate the models used in the management of the bank for example we use models to inform our estimate of the allowance for credit losses to manage interest rate and liquidity risk to project stress losses in various segments of our loan and securities portfolios and to project net revenue under stress models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons and cannot perfectly predict outcomes management decisions based in part on such models therefore may be suboptimal 

we outsource various operations to third party vendors which could adversely impact our business and operational performance 

we rely on various vendors to perform operational activities to conduct our business we have established operational controls and monitoring through our thirdparty vendor management programs to oversee and manage these vendors to help ensure they operate in a manner consistent with the business standards and practices that we 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

must adhere to or with which we must comply we have developed and implemented service level agreements and contractual controls to assist us in that effort and have implemented regular reporting to monitor and manage our thirdparty vendors replacing or finding alternatives for vendors who do not perform adequately however can be difficult and costly and may adversely impact our customers and other operations 

for information about how we manage operational risk see “operational technology and cyber risk management” on page 76 in mda 

technology risk 

we could be adversely affected by our ability to develop adopt and implement technology advancements 

our ability to remain competitive is increasingly dependent upon our ability to maintain critical technological capabilities and to identify and develop new valueadded products for existing and future customers these technological competitive pressures arise from both traditional banking and nontraditional sources larger banks may have greater resources and economies of scale attendant to maintaining existing capabilities and developing digital and other technologies while financial technology companies referred to as “fintechs” and technology platform companies continue to emerge and compete with traditional financial institutions across a wide variety of products and services our failure to remain technologically competitive could impede our time to market and reduce customer satisfaction product accessibility and relevance 

we could be adversely impacted by system vulnerabilities failures or outages impacting operations and customer services such as online and mobile banking 

we rely on hundreds of information technology systems that work together in supporting internal operations and customer services vulnerabilities in or a failure or outage of one or many of these systems could impact the ability to perform internal operations and provide services to customers such as online banking mobile banking remote deposit capture and other services dependent on system processing these risks increase as systems and software approach the end of their useful life or require more frequent updates and modifications we have response and recovery processes in place to address these types of issues but cannot guarantee that such occurrences will not still have an operational or customer impact 

for information regarding risks associated with the replacement or upgrades of our core technology systems see “strategic and business risk” on page 16 in risk factors for information about how we manage technology risk see “operational technology and cyber risk management” on page 76 in mda 

cyber risk 

we are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

the board and the risk committee of the board have invested significant time on overseeing managements efforts to continue to strengthen our infrastructure and staffing and to enhance our controls while improving the client and customer experience cyber defense and improving our resiliency against cybersecurity threats remain a key focus at all levels of management and of our board 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations information security risks for large financial institutions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and internet connections eg internet of things the internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external third parties third parties with whom we do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we will be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities and our ability to implement them in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

for information about how we manage cyber risk see “operational technology and cyber risk management” on page 76 in mda 

capitalfinancial reporting risk 

internal stress testing and capital management as well as provisions of the national bank act and occ regulations may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

we are required to submit stress tests to the occ because we have assets in excess of the occ 10 billion threshold and we continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions the stress testing and other applicable regulatory requirements may among other things require us to increase our capital levels limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under the national bank act and occ regulations certain capital transactions including share repurchases may be subject to the approval of the occ these requirements may limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to us 

we must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by our banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions as well as the particular conditions risk profiles and growth plans of the bank compliance with capital requirements may limit our ability to expand and has required and may require us or our subsidiaries to raise additional capital these uncertainties and risks including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties may increase our cost of capital and other financing costs 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory compliance risk 

we are exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatory compliance risk we use a number of complex financial products and services for our own capital funding investment and risk management needs in addition to providing them to our customers estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions the level of regulatory compliance oversight continues to be heightened as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required us to comply before their formal adoption therefore identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

as of december 31 2020 we had 1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to amegy bank “amegy” california bank  trust “cbt” and zions bank if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its

carrying value we may have to take a charge related to the impairment of our goodwill such a charge would occur if we were to experience increases in the book value of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in the fair value of equity of a reporting unit a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors described herein may necessitate us taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill if we were to conclude in the future that a writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

legalcompliance risk 

laws and regulations applicable to us and the financial services industry impose significant limitations on our business activities and subject us to increased regulation and additional costs 

we and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel systems consulting and other costs to comply with banking regulations including those promulgated under the doddfrank act see “supervision and regulation” on page 5 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about the regulations applicable to us and the financial services industry generally 

bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits accordingly we are subject to fdic insurance assessments 

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be enacted however if enacted some of these proposals could adversely affect us by among other things impacting aftertax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting our ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of our funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that we could offer and requiring us to raise capital at inopportune times 

political developments may also result in substantial changes in tax international trade immigration and other policies the extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain as are the potential direct and indirect impacts whether beneficial or adverse regulations and laws may be modified or repealed and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be enacted 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings our exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments new regulations promulgated under recently enacted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties eg civil money penalties under applicable banking laws injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations including those relating to antimoney laundering matters have been increasing dramatically in addition any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings which may restrict or limit our activities 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the corporate and securities laws applicable to us are not as welldeveloped as those applicable to a statechartered corporation which may impact our ability to effect corporate transactions in an efficient and optimal manner 

prior to the restructuring the corporate affairs of our holding company were governed by utah state law and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws including the securities act and the exchange act as administered by the sec each of these legal frameworks is welldeveloped and used widely by public companies 

postrestructuring our corporate affairs are governed by the national bank act and related regulations administered by the occ with respect to securities matters we are not subject to the securities act but rather to occ regulations governing securities offerings our common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the exchange act which vests the occ with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the exchange act applicable to banks though we currently make and intend to continue to make filings required by the exchange act with the sec as a voluntary filer these occ statutory and regulatory frameworks have been used by publicly traded banking organizations relatively rarely and are not as welldeveloped as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to corporations while certain specific risks associated with operating under these frameworks are described below unless and until these frameworks are further developed and established over time the uncertainty of how these frameworks might apply to any given corporate or securities matters may prevent us from effecting transactions in an efficient and optimal manner or perhaps at all 

differences between the national bank act and state law requirements regarding mergers could hinder our ability to execute acquisitions as efficiently and advantageously as bank holding companies or other financial institutions 

unlike state corporate law the national bank act requires shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for exceptions in the case of various “minor” mergers such as a parent company’s merger with a subsidiary or an acquirer’s merger with an unaffiliated entity in which the shares issued by the acquirer do not exceed a designated percentage the national bank act and related regulations may also complicate the structuring of certain nonbank acquisitions 

these differences could adversely affect the ability of the bank and other banks registered under the national bank act to efficiently consummate acquisition transactions in addition such differences could make us less competitive as a potential acquirer in certain circumstances given that our acquisition proposal may be conditioned on bank shareholder approval while our competitors’ proposals will not have such a condition 

differences between the national bank act and state law could reduce our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares when compared with those capacities that existed for zions bancorporation prior to the restructuring 

the regulations and limitations applicable to us regarding the payment of dividends and repurchases or redemptions of outstanding common and preferred shares differ from the limitations and considerations that applied to our holding company prior to the restructuring while we do not believe this change in legal restrictions resulting from the restructuring will constrain us from executing any capital plans that are currently contemplated or otherwise reasonably foreseeable in the near term there can be no assurance that the change in legal restrictions will not have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase or redeem stock in the future 

shares of common stock of a national bank are assessable which may cause investors to view our common stock less favorably than that of zions bancorporation prior to the restructuring 

the national bank act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable ie holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the occ in contrast the common stock of state corporations is not subject to assessment however the occ has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the national bank act assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank’s stock our common stock has a par value of 0001 moreover according to the occ it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation including robust capital standards prompt 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

corrective action requirements and supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level nonetheless potential investors may be unfamiliar with the concept of assessment and as a result view us less favorably as an investment 

the ability of investors to access financial and other reports filed by us readily could be adversely affected if such reports were not able to be made available publicly through the sec or a system operated by the occ comparable to that of the sec 

we have been permitted to and currently make our exchange act filings as a voluntary filer with the sec however there can be no assurance that the occ or sec will continue to allow us to make filings as a voluntary filer or that the occ will develop a comparable system for making exchange act filings publicly available if our exchange act filings ceased to be as readily available as those of bank holding companies investors could view us less favorably 

our ability to issue securities in an optimal manner may be adversely affected by the fact that the occ’s securities offering regulations and organizational structure are less welldeveloped than those of the sec which applied to our holding company prior to the restructuring 

the sec maintains a welldeveloped regulatory framework and wellstaffed organization relating to securities offerings under or exempt from the securities act for example the sec has developed integrated disclosure rules which allow exchange act filings to be incorporated by reference into prospectuses distributed as required by the securities act in addition under the sec’s rules seasoned issuers who are timely in their filings are permitted to use “automatic shelf registration” allowing them to offer securities under a registration statement that is automatically effective upon filing the occ maintains its own securities offering framework applicable to national banks and their securities offerings with which we will need to comply in order to access the public capital markets similar to the sec’s offering rules the occ’s framework requires that registration statements be reviewed and declared or become effective however given that there are currently no other nationally chartered banks whose common stock has been issued under the occ’s securities offering framework it is unknown at this point whether and how the occ staff would review registration statements it is also unclear whether the occ would apply the same mechanics for automatic shelf registration filings used by secfilers or how more generally the occ will function as a securities regulator given the extent to and manner in which we have accessed capital markets historically or to which we currently contemplate accessing such markets we do not believe there will be a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital markets effectively although there can be no assurance that this will be the case it is possible that operating under the occ’s securities offering framework could impede our ability to sell securities at the most advantageous times or to achieve optimum pricing in offerings 

we are subject to restrictions on permissible activities that would limit the types of business we may conduct and that may make acquisitions of other financial companies more challenging 

under applicable laws and regulations bank holding companies and banks are generally limited to business activities and investments that are related to banking or are financial in nature the range of permissible financial activities is set forth in the grammleachbliley act and is more limited for banks than for bank holding company organizations the differences relate mainly to insurance underwriting but not insurance agency activities and merchant banking but not brokerdealer and investment advisory activities loss of the bank holding company status because of the restructuring could make future acquisitions of financial institutions with such operations more challenging 

our common stock is not an insured deposit 

shares of our common stock are not a bank deposit and therefore losses in value are not insured by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in shares of our common stock is inherently risky and is subject to the same market forces and investment risks that affect the price of common stock in any other company including the possible loss of some or all principal invested

reputational risk 

we are presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational regulatory compliance and legal risks 

any of the aforementioned risks may give rise to adverse publicity and damaged relationships giving rise to reputational risk a reputational risk council was established to monitor manage and develop strategies to effectively manage reputational risk which includes but is not limited to addressing communication logistics legal and regulatory issues 

other risk 

our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect these aspects of our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the scope and duration of the pandemic the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees customers communities counterparties and service providers as well as other market participants and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has contributed to the following any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

• increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business activity generally leading to an increased risk of delinquencies defaults and foreclosures 

• ratings downgrades credit deterioration and defaults in many sectors and industries including but not limited to municipalities retail oil and gas hotels and casinos restaurants telecommunicationsmedia real estateconstruction airlines and transportation and leisure and recreation 

• a sudden and significant reduction in the values of the equity fixedincome and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets 

• a decrease in the rates and yields on us treasury and other securities which may lead to decreased net interest income 

• heightened cybersecurity information security and operational risks as a result of workfromhome arrangements 

we are prioritizing the safety of our customers communities and employees by among other things limiting branch activity to a specified number of individuals at any given time encouraging the use of drivethrough services or inoffice appointments and transitioning many of our employees to working remotely if these measures are not effective in serving our customers or affect the productivity of our employees they may lead to significant disruptions in our business operations 

many of our counterparties and thirdparty service providers have also been and may further be affected by “stayathome” orders market volatility and other factors that increase their risk of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or to provide essential services 

we have offered and may offer in the future special financial assistance to support customers who are experiencing financial hardships related to the covid19 pandemic including waivers of certain withdrawal fees from cds savings and money market accounts loan payment deferrals and extensions credit card payment extensions temporary consumer mortgage payment forbearance and payment deferrals suspension of new automobile and other vehicle repossessions and suspension of new residential property foreclosures on consumer real estate loans if such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the covid19 pandemic on borrowers we may experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periods 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

certain segments and industries where we have elevated credit exposure including but not limited to municipalities retail oil and gas hotels and casinos restaurants telecommunicationsmedia commercial and other real estateconstructiondevelopment airlines and transportation and leisure and recreation have experienced significant operational challenges and financial stress as a result of the covid19 pandemic these challenges have been particularly pronounced for many small businesses which make up a significant portion of our customer base the effects of the covid19 pandemic may also hinder our customers ability to pay their loans on a timely basis or may decrease the value of collateral which would likely cause increases in our credit losses 

net interest income is the largest component of our revenue and is significantly affected by market rates of interest the significant reductions to the federal funds rate have led to a decrease in the rates and yields on us treasury securities in some rare cases declining below zero if interest rates are reduced further in response to the covid19 pandemic we expect that our net interest income will decline perhaps significantly the overall effect of lower interest rates on the economic environment cannot be predicted with certainty and will depend on future actions the federal reserve may take to increase or reduce the targeted federal funds rate in response to the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic conditions 

governmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses stabilize the markets and support economic growth the success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic additionally some measures such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures may have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny because of the effects of the covid19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions 

the length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown until the pandemic subsides we expect reduced revenues and increased customer and client defaults even after the pandemic subsides the us economy may experience a recession which may be prolonged and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business financial condition or results of operations it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this report

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

this form 10k presents nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to provide investors with additional information the adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are presented in the following schedules we consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons these nongaap financial measures are used by management to assess our performance and financial position and for presentations of our performance to investors we further believe that presenting these nongaap financial measures will permit investors to assess our performance on the same basis as applied by management and the banking industry 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities although nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under gaap the following are the nongaap financial measures presented in this form 10k and a discussion of the reasons for which management and investors use these nongaap measures

results of operations 

covid19 pandemic the backdrop for our 2020 financial performance 

the year 2020 presented a great number of challenges and the covid19 pandemic resulted in hardships for many key examples of our response to the challenging environment are set forth below 

• although the sharp reduction of shorterterm benchmark interest rates to nearly zero and a significant flattening of the interest rate curve resulted in a reduction of revenue the fiscal stimulus provided by the cares act and specifically the ppp allowed us to provide relief to more than 47000 customers — 14700 customers of which were new to us — by facilitating a lending lifeline to these businesses these new customers helped increase the total number of our business customers by nearly 8 in 2020 

• we ranked as the ninth largest originator of ppp loans by dollar volume of all the participating financial institutions as disclosed by the sba our market share of this program was approximately 35 times our overall national deposit market share as measured by deposits we attribute this success to two key factors 

◦ we leveraged our relationshipbased hightouch approach to banking during the development and rollout of the ppp loans many of our employees worked long hours to call on customers and to ensure their questions were answered and that the process was as efficient as possible 

◦ we rapidly deployed technology solutions that expedited the flow of applications this was made possible due to the streamlining and advancements we have made in technology in recent years 

• we originated 35 billion of residential mortgages in 2020 enabling many consumers to lower their monthly payments this record origination volume was made possible in part by our investments in residential mortgage banking technology and operations over the past several years 

• we were able to quickly transition more than 70 of our employees to a workfromhome environment to help reduce the spread of the covid19 virus and to keep our employees and communities safe for our banking branches we modified the hours of operation and limited lobby visits through scheduled inbranch appointments and expanded use of drivethrough banking facilities 

• in recent years we invested significantly in technology that enabled customers to open accounts without visiting a branch or office mobile and online banking for retail customers increased 10 in 2020 from 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

2019 as measured by total logins thereby enabling customers to fulfill many of their banking needs from the convenience of their mobile devices and computers 

executive summary of our financial performance 





the financial performance of 2020 relative to 2019 reflects 

• moderate reduction in net interest income due to interest ratedriven compression of the net interest margin “nim” which was partially offset by an increase in earning asset balances due to ppp loan originations 

• a strong increase in average deposits 

• an increase in customerrelated noninterest income primarily attributable to strong residential mortgage loan originations and sales 

• a decrease in adjusted noninterest expense excluding infrequent items such as severance restructuring and pension termination noninterest expense declined 2 compared with 2019 

• a deterioration of asset quality and a significant increase in the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses increased 309 million from january 1 2020 which resulted in an increase in the provision for credit losses of 375 million from the prior year net loan and lease chargeoffs were 105 million or 02 of average nonppp loans up from 37 million or 01 of average loans in the prior year 

the net result of the above factors yielded a 35 decrease in net earnings applicable to common shareholders to 505 million for 2020 from 782 million for 2019 earnings per diluted share of 302 for 2020 declined by 27 compared with 416 for 2019

key drivers of performance 



1 includes loans held for sale 

net interest income and net interest margin 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities and is approximately 79 of our net revenue net interest income is derived from both the volume of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and their respective yields and rates 

schedule 6 

interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and net interest margin — 

2020 vs 2019 



1 rates are calculated using amounts in thousands and a tax rate of 21 for the periods presented the taxableequivalent rates used are the rates that were applicable at the time of each respective reporting period 

net interest income and taxableequivalent net interest income were both 22 billion during 2020 a decrease of 01 billion or 4 compared with 23 billion during 2019 the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 21 for 2020 and 2019 yields on loans and securities decreased by 88 bps and 36 bps respectively while yields on deposits and borrowed funds decreased by 50 bps and 125 bps respectively the impact of lower interest rates was partially offset by loan growth from ppp activity and a shift in liability balances from federal funds purchased and other shortterm borrowings to lowercost deposits 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the nim compressed to 315 in 2020 compared with 354 in 2019 due to the lower interest rate environment the net impact of noninterestbearing sources of funds on the nim decreased to 018 in 2020 compared with 046 in 2019 

average interestearning assets increased 62 billion or 10 in 2020 from 2019 with the average yield decreasing 80 bps the yield on average interestearning assets includes the dilutive effect of 45 billion 6 of earning assets of ppp loans with a yield of 322 as compared with a yield on the nonppp loan portfolio of 396 

  average loans increased in 2020 primarily due to ppp loan originations which were funded mainly through deposit growth the average loan yield decreased 88 bps over the same prior year period with decreases of 75 bps 124 bps and 51 bps in nonppp commercial loans cre and consumer loans respectively recently as benchmark interest rates have settled at a lower level yields on new loans have been only modestly lower than yields on maturing loans 

during 2020 we provided assistance to many small businesses through the ppp loan processing fees paid to us by the sba are accounted for as loan origination fees which are deferred with the loan origination costs and are recognized over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment toward the end of the third quarter of 2020 we extended the maturity dates of ppp loans with an initial twoyear maturity to five years which lengthened the period of time the remaining unamortized net deferred fees are recognized into interest income as a yield adjustment when a ppp loan is paid off or forgiven by the sba prior to its maturity date the remaining unamortized net deferred fees are immediately recognized into interest income at that time and impact the ppp loan portfolio yield in that period as of december 31 2020 there were approximately 102 million of unamortized net origination fees related to the ppp loans 

the ppp loan yield in 2020 was 322 beginning in october 2020 the sba initiated forgiveness of the ppp loans during 2020 about 9900 ppp loans totaling 13 billion received forgiveness by the sba and contributed 26 million of interest income through accelerated recognition of net unamortized deferred fees on these loans additionally on december 27 2020 the consolidated appropriations act was signed into law which extended the ppp and provided government funding for additional forgivable ppp loans these developments and other potential future program changes will affect ppp interest income and the effective yield of the ppp loans in future periods 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

benchmark interest rates decreased in 2020 and 2019 resulting in the previously described negative effect on 

yields a portion of our variablerate loans such as those with longer initial fixedrate periods or longer reset frequencies eg five and sevenyear fixedrate adjustable mortgages have not yet been affected by declines in benchmark interest rates generally a larger portion of our interestearning assets reprice when compared with our funding sources partly because nearly half of our deposits are noninterestbearing 

average availableforsale “afs” securities balances decreased by 181 million in 2020 yields on average afs securities decreased by 36 bps over the same time period the duration of the afs securities portfolio is 31 principal repayment volume on afs securities during 2020 was 44 billion or 32 of the december 31 2019 balance we purchased 62 billion of afs securities during 2020 

average interestbearing liabilities increased 563 million in 2020 from 2019 and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities decreased 69 bps to 40 bps average total deposits were 637 billion at an average cost of 17 bps during 2020 compared with 551 billion at an average cost of 46 bps during 2019 various government stimulus programs have provided additional liquidity to individuals and small businesses which has indirectly contributed to deposit growth average interestbearing deposits grew 10 and were 348 billion at an average cost of 30 bps during 2020 compared with 317 billion at an average cost of 80 bps during 2019 

average borrowed funds decreased 25 billion during 2020 from 2019 with average shortterm borrowings decreasing 28 billion and average longterm borrowings increasing 308 million during the same period strong deposit growth allowed us to reduce shortterm borrowings and to repurchase 429 million of our outstanding longterm debt maturing in 2021 and 2022 during 2020 the average interest rate paid on shortterm borrowings and the rate paid on longterm debt decreased by 184 bps and 124 bps respectively due to lower shortterm rates and interest rate hedges on our longterm fixedrate debt 

the 29 bps decline in the cost of total deposits and the 50 bps decline in the cost of interestbearing deposits can be largely attributed to the previously mentioned decline in benchmark market rates which reduced competitive pricing pressure for deposits 

although we utilize a wide variety of sources for our funding needs we benefit from access to deposits from a significant number of small to midsized business customers which provides us with a low cost of funds that has a positive impact on our nim because many of our deposit accounts are of an operating nature for businesses and households we expect our noninterestbearing deposits to remain a competitive advantage average noninterest

bearing demand deposits increased by 55 billion or 24 in 2020 from 2019 average noninterestbearing deposits comprised 45 and 42 of average total deposits for 2020 and 2019 respectively the net positive impact of noninterestbearing sources of funds on the nim was 018 during 2020 compared with 046 during 2019 reflecting the decline in benchmark interest rates 

interest expense decreased 259 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to both a decrease in the cost of deposits and wholesale funds as well as a shift in balances from highertolower cost funding sources which included a decrease in the quantity of borrowed funds and brokered deposits and an increase in the quantity of both noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits 

the spread on average interestbearing funds wa s 297 and 308 during 2020 and 2019 respectively and was affected by the same factors that impacted the nim interest rate spreads and margins are impacted by the mix of assets we hold the composition of our loan and securities portfolios and the type of funding used our interest rate risk position estimates are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes further detail on interest rate risk is described in “interest rate and market risk management” on page 67 refer to the “liquidity risk management” section beginning on page 73 for more information on how we manage liquidity risk

2019 vs 2018 



1 rates are calculated using amounts in thousands and tax rate of 21 for the periods presented the taxableequivalent rates used are the rates that were applicable at the time of each respective reporting period 

net interest income was 23 billion during 2019 a slight increase from 22 billion during 2018 taxableequivalent net interest income was 23 billion in both 2019 and 2018 

the nim was 354 and 361 for 2019 and 2018 respectively when comparing 2019 with 2018 higher interest rates and a greater concentration of loans in the earning asset mix led to an increase in earning asset yield which was more than offset by an increase in deposit rates and a modestly greater reliance on highercost borrowed funds funding loan growth with wholesale borrowings negatively impacted the nim relative to deposit funding although it was accretive to net interest income the net impact of noninterestbearing sources of funds on the nim increased to 046 in 2019 compared with 033 in 2018

average loans increased 29 billion or 6 in 2019 due to widespread growth in essentially all loans categories with average commercial loans accounting for over half of the growth loan growth was funded through a mix of deposits securities runoff and wholesale borrowings yields on average loan balances increased by 7 bps 16 bps and 18 bps in the commercial cre and consumer portfolios respectively the commercial loan growth was in municipal commercial and industrial and owneroccupied loans where our yields are generally lower than commercial real estate “cre” but higher than consumer the federal funds target rate decreased three times in 2019 after increasing four times in 2018 

the average balance of our investment securities portfolio decreased 04 billion in 2019 while the yearend balance decreased 11 billion

the average balance of longterm debt increased 701 million in 2019 compared with 2018 while the average rate decreased 152 bps overall interest expense on longterm debt increased 18 million in 2019 we used shortterm federal home loan bank “fhlb” borrowings to fund some of our balance sheet growth during 2019 and 2018 average shortterm debt grew 02 billion and the rate paid increased 43 bps in 2019 

interest expense increased 160 million in 2019 compared with 2018 results attributable to both an increase in the cost and quantity of deposits and wholesale funding interest expense on deposits increased 119 million on 317 billion of average interestbearing deposits average interestbearing liabilities increased 32 billion while average rates increased 36 bps 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 308 in 2019 compared with 328 in 2018 the spread on average interestbearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim

provision for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses “acl” is the combination of both the allowance for loan and lease losses “alll” and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments “rulc” the alll represents the estimated current expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date the rulc represents the estimated reserve for current expected credit losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments changes in the alll and rulc including changes in net chargeoffs are recorded in the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the income statement respectively the acl for debt securities is estimated separately from loans 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

on january 1 2020 we adopted asu 201613 credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and its subsequent updates often referred to as the current expected credit loss “cecl” model upon adoption of this asu we recorded the full amount of the acl for loans and leases of 526 million compared with 554 million at december 31 2019 resulting in an aftertax increase to retained earnings of 20 million the impact of the adoption of cecl for our securities portfolio was less than 1 million as a result of the cecl accounting standard the acl is subject to economic forecasts that may change materially from period to period 

the provision for credit losses which is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments was 414 million in 2020 compared with 39 million in 2019 the acl increased 309 million to 835 million at december 31 2020 compared with 526 million at january 1 2020 the increase in the acl is almost entirely due to economic stress caused by the covid19 pandemic coupled with the effect of low oil and gas prices the ratio of net chargeoffs to average loans during 2020 was 020 compared with 008 during 2019 the provision for credit losses for debt securities was less than 1 million during 2020 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

 january 1 2020 amount is used instead of december 31 2019 for comparative purposes because this is the date the cecl accounting standard became effective 

the total acl was 835 million at december 31 2020 compared with 526 million at january 1 2020 the bar chart above shows the broad categories of change in the acl the second bar represents the change in acl due to changes in economic forecasts the 373 million increase from january 1 2020 is our estimate of the change in credit losses due to the change in economic forecasts brought on by the onset of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn including the impact of low oil and gas prices as of december 31 2020 our base forecast shows economic improvement continuing throughout 2021 gradually stabilizing by 2022 credit quality factors represented by the third bar include riskgrade migration and specific reserves against loans which when combined add 104 million to the acl when compared with 2019 showing credit quality deterioration during the year lastly portfolio changes driven by nonppp loan balances declining the aging of the portfolio decreased utilization and other similar factors generated a 168 million reduction in the acl 

see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield and is classified as either customerrelated or noncustomerrelated fee income we believe a subtotal of customerrelated fees provides a better view of income over which we have more direct nearterm control and excludes items such as marktomarket adjustments on certain derivatives dividends insurancerelated income and securities gains and losses 

total noninterest income increased by 12 million to 574 million in 2020 compared with 562 million in 2019 and 552 million in 2018 noninterest income accounted for approximately 21 and 20 of net revenue during 2020 and 2019 respectively 

schedule 10 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years

noninterest income 



customerrelated fees 

growing customerrelated fee income is a key strategic priority and several strategic initiatives are underway to support this effort we are working to leverage our relationship with commercial and small business customers to accelerate sales of capital markets products treasury management products and wealth advisory services 

total customerrelated fees increased to 549 million in 2020 compared with 525 million in 2019 and 508 million in 2018 loanrelated fees and income increased 34 million in 2020 due to residential mortgage loan originations and sales which benefited from the reduction in benchmark interest rates and our enhanced customerfacing digital fulfillment process retail and business banking fees decreased 10 million in 2020 due to fee waivers as a result of the covid19 pandemic card fees decreased 10 million in 2020 due to reduced economic activity and transaction volume 

customerrelated fees increased by 17 million or 3 during 2019 capital markets and foreign exchange fees increased by 20 million as a result of an 11 million increase in income from arranging interest rate hedges for our loan customers a 4 million increase in loan syndication arrangement fees and a 3 million increase in foreign exchange fees wealth management and trust fees increased by 5 million or 9 as a result of increased corporate and personal trust revenue other customerrelated fees decreased by 6 million or 22 primarily as a result of the sale of a minor business in 2019 

noncustomerrelated fees 

dividends and other income decreased by 19 million during 2020 primarily due to lower dividends received from the federal home loan bank “fhlb” reflecting less fhlb stock held by us 

when comparing 2019 with 2018 fair value and nonhedge derivative income decreased by 8 million due to valuation adjustments on clientrelated interest rate swaps during 2019 as a result of the decline in interest rates during 2019 and increased client activity during the year these clientrelated interest rate swaps significantly increased in value resulting in the bank having a larger exposure to the clients and a 9 million negative valuation adjustment in 2019 compared with a negative valuation adjustment of 1 million in 2018

noninterest expense 

schedule 11 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

schedule 11 

noninterest expense 



noninterest expense decreased by 38 million or 2 in 2020 compared with 2019 adjusted noninterest expense decreased by 31 million or 2 over the same period and includes a 30 million charitable contribution in 2020 see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 28 for more information regarding the calculation of adjusted noninterest expense 

schedule 12 

salaries and employee benefits 



salaries and employee benefits decreased by 54 million or 5 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to an increase in capitalized salaries and employee benefits as a result of our technology initiatives and ppp loan originations lower severance costs and base salaries related to the reduction in workforce and a decrease in the profit sharing contribution to the employee 401k plan fulltime equivalent employees decreased to 9678 at december 31 2020 compared with 10188 at december 31 2019 during 2020 we paid 21 million in ppprelated bonuses of which approximately 16 million was capitalized and deferred 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 71 million or 7 in 2019 compared with 2018 mainly due to a 33 million increase in base salaries resulting from salary merit increases a 22 million increase in severance expenses primarily from the previously mentioned workforce reduction a 6 million increase in employee medical costs and a 4 million increase in retirement expenses these increases were partially offset by a 7 million decrease in incentive compensation 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

other noninterest expense increased by 16 million to 241 million in 2020 compared with 225 million in 2019 this increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned 30 million charitable contribution and a 28 million pension plan terminationrelated expense partially offset by an 18 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense a 13 million impairment charge in 2019 related to centralizing our office space and the closure of certain branches and 10 million of customer reimbursements in 2019 to remedy a selfidentified operational issue these same expenses that occurred in 2019 contributed to the same reasons for the 28 million increase in other noninterest expense in 2019 compared with 2018 

when comparing 2019 with 2018 the other significant variance was a 25 million decrease in fdic premiums which was primarily due to the elimination of the fdic surcharge for large banks because the required deposit insurance fund reserve ratio had been met and the bank issuing unsecured debt which results in lower fdic premiums 

income taxes 

income tax expense was 133 million in 2020 237 million in 2019 and 259 million in 2018 our effective income tax rates were 198 in 2020 225 in 2019 and 227 in 2018 the income tax rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance “boli” and were increased by the nondeductibility of fdic premiums certain executive compensation and other fringe benefits the tax rate for 2020 was also reduced as a result of the proportional increase in nontaxable items and tax credits relative to pretax book income as compared with 2019 and 2018 

we continued to invest in technology initiatives lowincome housing and municipal securities during 2020 2019 and 2018 generating tax credits and nontaxable income that benefited the tax rate each year 

we had a net deferred tax liability “dtl” balance of 3 million at december 31 2020 compared with a net deferred tax asset “dta” balance of 37 million at december 31 2019 the decrease from a net dta to a net dtl balance resulted primarily from an increase in unrealized gains in oci related to securities and accelerated tax deductions on certain technology initiatives and depreciable property during 2020 an increase in the provision for loan losses in excess of net chargeoffs offset some of the overall decrease in dta 

we did not record any dta valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2020 note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discloses information about our evaluation of the dta including any potential additional valuation allowances 

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock dividends have been consistent during the past three years and were 34 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 see further details in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

• decreased income before income taxes 

• increased loan balances across all geographies mainly due to ppp loan originations 

• growth in customer deposit balances across almost all segments which were assisted by various government economic stimulus programs and 

• lower credit quality and higher allowance for credit losses

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases 

schedule 8 which we referenced in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of our interestearning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another goal is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets as a result of this goal we redeployed funds from loweryielding money market investments in addition to using wholesale borrowings to purchase agency securities 

average interestearning assets were 712 billion in 2020 compared with 649 billion in 2019 average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 94 and 93 in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

average loans were 530 billion in 2020 and 483 billion in 2019 average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 70 in 2020 compared with 69 in 2019 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold and security resell agreements increased by 127 from 2019 average securities decreased by 2 from 2019 average total deposits increased by 16 average total loans also increased by 10 in 2020 when compared with 2019

other noninterestbearing investments 

during 2020 we decreased our shortterm borrowings with the fhlb by 1 billion this decrease required a reduced investment in fhlb activity stock which consequently decreased by 39 million during the year additionally there were decreases of 19 million to both our farmer mac stock and the value of our sbic investments during the year aside from these decreases other noninterestbearing investments remained relatively stable as set forth in the following schedule schedule 17 summarizes our other noninterestbearing investments

risk management 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of our operations management of risk is an integral part of our operations and is also a key determinant of our overall performance we utilize the three lines of defense approach to risk management with responsibilities for each line of defense defined in our risk management framework the first line of defense represents units and functions throughout the bank engaged in activities related to revenue generation expense reduction operational support and technology services these units and functions are accountable for owning and managing the risks associated with these activities the second line of defense represents functions responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risk management activities the third line of defense is our internal audit function that provides independent assessment of the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defense 

the board of directors has established an audit committee a compensation committee and a risk oversight committee “roc” that consist of appointed board members who oversee our risk management processes the roc meets on a regular basis to monitor and review enterprise risk management “erm” activities as required by its charter the roc performs oversight for various erm activities and approves erm policies and activities as detailed in the roc charter 

management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which our operations are exposed including credit risk market and interest rate risk liquidity risk strategic and business risk operational risk technology risk cyber risk capitalfinancial reporting risk legalcompliance risk including regulatory risk reputational risk and other risk these risks are overseen by various management committees including an enterprise risk management committee which is the central point for monitoring reviewing and managing enterprise risk 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

the board of directors through the roc is responsible for approving the overall credit policies relating to the management of credit risk the roc also oversees and monitors adherence to key credit policies and the credit risk appetite as defined in the risk management framework additionally the board has established the credit risk committee which is chaired by the chief credit officer and includes members of management and to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk and approving changes to credit policies 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit risk management and credit examination functions our credit policies place emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses these formal credit policies and procedures provide us with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level credit examinations related to the acl are reported to both the audit committee and the roc 

our credit risk management function is separate from the lending function and strengthens control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities in addition we have a welldefined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio and we utilize a comprehensive loan riskgrading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore the internal credit examination department which is independent of the lending function periodically conducts examinations of our lending departments and credit activities these examinations are 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan riskgrading administration and compliance with credit policies new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the change initiatives and technology committee 

our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographic footprint of our banking affiliates we attempt to avoid the risk of undue concentrations of credit in any particular industry collateral type location or with any individual customer or counterparty due to the nature of our geographic footprint we have certain significant concentrations including cre and oil and gasrelated lending we have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on leveraged lending municipal lending oil and gasrelated lending and various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary 

as we continued to monitor our concentration risk the composition of our loan portfolio changed slightly from the prior year total commercial loans were 57 and 52 of the total portfolio at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively cre loans were 23 and 24 of the total portfolio at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively consumer loans were 20 and 24 of the total loan portfolio at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively

2 delinquency rates include nonaccrual loans 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

at december 31 2020 our cre construction and land development and term loan portfolios represented approximately 23 of the total loan portfolio the majority of our cre loans are secured by real estate which is primarily located within our geographic footprint approximately 23 of the cre loan portfolio matures in the next 12 months construction and land development loans generally mature in 18 to 36 months and contain full or partial recourse guarantee structures with one to fiveyear extension options or rolltoperm options that often result in term debt term cre loans generally mature within a three to sevenyear period and consist of full partial and nonrecourse guarantee structures typical term cre loan structures include annuallytested operating covenants that require loan rebalancing based on minimum debt service coverage debt yield or loantovalue tests 

approximately 156 million or 7 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2020 consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects 

underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily and hospitality construction projects we require substantial preleasing or leasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan significant consideration is given to the forecasted market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower generally by our internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed a new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness 

advance rates ie loan commitments will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and homes not under contract and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement 

the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when evaluating cre loans for expected losses if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our expected loss methodology takes this repayment source into consideration 

when we modify or extend a loan we also give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether we have granted a concession in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

granted however if additional collateral is obtained or if a guarantor exists who has the capacity and willingness to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared with the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

consumer loans 

we have primarily been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality we generally hold variablerate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixedrate loans to third parties including federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards 

we are engaged in home equity credit line “hecl” lending at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 our hecl portfolio totaled 27 billion and 29 billion respectively the following schedule describes the composition of our hecl portfolio by lien status 

schedule 26 

hecl portfolio by lien status 



at december 31 2020 loans representing less than 1 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateralvalue at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination 

approximately 91 of our hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 19 of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years we regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates the analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment the ratio of net chargeoffs for the trailing twelve months to average balances at yearend 2020 and 2019 was 001 and 002 respectively see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit quality of this portfolio 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned “oreo” increased to 069 at december 31 2020 compared with 051 at december 31 2019 

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2020 increased to 367 million from 243 million at december 31 2019 primarily in the 14 family residential mortgage and commercial and industrial loan portfolios 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on nonaccrual loans

restructured loans 

troubled debt restructurings “tdrs” are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties and for whom we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider tdrs increased 158 million or 103 during 2020 commercial and commercial real estate loans may be modified to provide the borrower temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan to provide more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such consumer loan tdrs may include residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether a loan is returned to accrual status

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 



in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs

covid19 modifications and deferrals 

we developed various debt relief programs for our borrowers who have been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic these programs primarily began in the second quarter of 2020 and generally consisted of shortterm or 90day principal and interest loan payment deferrals consistent with accounting and regulatory guidance loan modifications provided to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties exclusively related to the covid19 pandemic in which we provided these shortterm modifications or payment deferrals are not classified as tdrs other loan modifications above and beyond these shortterm modifications or payment deferrals are assessed for tdr classification 

during 2020 we provided payment deferrals or other payment modifications related to covid19 hardships with respect to approximately 43 billion of total loan balances as of december 31 2020 38 billion was outstanding of which approximately 42 million or 11 was 90 days or more past due  

allowance for credit losses 

the acl includes the alll and the rulc for the year 2020 the acl represented our estimate of current expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments as of the balance sheet date we determined our acl as the best estimate within a range of estimated current expected losses over the contractual remaining life of each loan for periods prior to 2020 the acl represented management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio at that time and the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance was based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios to determine the adequacy of the allowance our loan and lease portfolio is segmented based on loan type

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other ratesensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixedincome securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

our board of directors approves the overall policies relating to the management of our financial risk including interest rate and market risk management the board has established the assetliability committee “alco” consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing our interest rate and market risk alco establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews with the roc the limits and limit exceptions reported by management 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to manage balance sheet sensitivity to reduce net income volatility due to changes in interest rates 

while over the course of the last several years we have actively reduced the level of asset sensitivity through interest rate swap hedges and the purchase of shorttomedium duration agency passthrough securities the decline in interest rates has led to lower deposit rate sensitivity and combined with strong deposit growth our asset sensitivity has increased due to our concentration in noninterestbearing deposits as well as the low interest rates paid on our interestbearing deposits there is little room to reduce deposit costs 

at december 31 2019 we had 15 billion of fixedtofloating interest rate swaps hedging longterm debt effectively converting the fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt in late march 2020 we terminated 10 billion of swaps ie two 500 million swaps with maturities in august 2021 and february 2022 with a combined fair value of 36 million that adjusted the carrying value of the debt by the same amount the basis adjustment will be 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

amortized as an adjustment to interest expense through the maturity of the debt thereby reducing the effective interest rate 429 million of the 2021 and 2022 debt was subsequently retired which accelerated the amortization for the portion of the swaps hedging the retired debt for more information on derivatives designated as qualifying hedges see note 7 – derivative instruments and hedging activities  

the following schedule presents all derivatives utilized in our assetliability management “alm” activities that are designated in qualifying hedging relationships as defined by gaap as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the schedule includes the notional amount fair value and the weightedaverage receivefixed rate for each category of interest rate derivatives the schedule for the current year has cash flow hedges shown by maturity for the next five years fair value hedges are shown by maturity every five to 10 years while the previous year’s schedule has all categories shown by maturity for the next five years

interest rate risk measurement 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods net interest income simulation or earnings at risk “ear” and economic value of equity at risk “eve” ear analyzes the expected change in nearterm one year net interest income in response to changes in interest rates in the eve method we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates 

ear is an estimate of the change in total net interest income that would be recognized under different interest rate environments over a oneyear period this simulated impact to net interest income due to a change in rates uses as its base a modeled net interest income that is not necessarily the same as the most recent quarter’s or year’s reported net interest income rather ear employs estimated net interest income under an unchanged interest rate scenario as the basis for comparison the ear process then simulates changes to the base net interest income under several interest rate scenarios including parallel and nonparallel interest rate shifts across the yield curve taking into account deposit repricing assumptions and estimates of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio eg a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lowerrate environment the ear model does not contemplate changes in fee income that are amortized into interest income eg premiums discounts origination points and costs etc our policy contains a trigger for a 10 decline in ratesensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps exceptions to the ear limits are subject to notification and approval by the roc 

eve is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities we measure changes in the dollar amount of eve for parallel shifts in interest rates due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in eve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney interest rate caps or limits on loans which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for lowrate mortgages in a higherrate environment our policy contains a trigger for an 8 decline in eve as well as a risk capacity of a 10 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps exceptions to the eve limits are subject to notification and approval by the roc 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

estimating the impact on net interest income and eve requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration eg customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit competitive pricing eg existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates loan and security prepayments and the effects of other similar embedded options as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans we also calculate the sensitivity of ear and eve results to key assumptions as most of our liabilities are comprised of indeterminate maturity and managed rate deposits such as checking savings and money market accounts the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for these deposits and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options we use historical regression analysis as a guide for setting such assumptions however due to the current low interest rate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit behavior may not reflect actual future results additionally competition for funding in the marketplace has and may again result in changes to deposit pricing on interestbearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as libor or the federal funds rate 

under most rising interest rate scenarios we would expect some customers to move balances from demand deposits to interestbearing accounts such as money market savings or certificates of deposit the models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration 

in addition we assume a correlation often referred to as a “deposit beta” with respect to interestbearing deposits wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared with changes in average benchmark interest rates generally certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate while interestonchecking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate actual results may differ materially due to factors including the shape of the yield curve competitive pricing money supply our credit worthiness and so forth however we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions 

the aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in the following schedule 

schedule 33 

deposit assumptions 



as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows ear or percentage change in net interest income based on a static balance sheet size in the first year after the interest rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

schedule 34 

income simulation – change in net interest income 



1 assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift 

for nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 25 if the weighted average deposit beta were to increase 6 the ear in the 100 bps rate shock would change from 92 to 84 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

for comparative purposes the december 31 2019 measures are presented in the following schedule 



1 assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift 

the asset sensitivity as measured by ear increased since december 31 2019 primarily due to lower assumed rate sensitivity of interestbearing deposits and an increase in noninterestbearing deposits 

the ear analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of rates the yield curve typically does not move in a parallel manner if we consider a flattening rate shock where the shortterm rate moves 200 bps but the 10year rate only moves 30 bps the increase in ear is 14 less over 24 months compared with the parallel 200 bps rate shock 

as of the dates indicated the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in eve under parallel interest rate changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps for these parallel changes we assumed interest rates will not decline below 0 for nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 25 if the weighted average deposit beta were to increase 6 it would change the eve in the 100 bps rate shock from 120 to 116 in the 100 bps rate shock the eve would increase due to the fact that we cap the value of our indeterminate deposits at their par value or equivalently we assume no premium would be required to dispose of these liabilities given that depositors could be repaid at par since our assets increase in value as rates fall and the majority of our liabilities are indeterminate deposits eve increases disproportionately

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of our assetliability management posture at december 31 2020 22 billion of our commercial lending and cre loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate loans approximately 98 are tied to either the prime rate or libor for these variablerate loans we have executed 32 billion of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps or through purchased interest rate floors additionally asset sensitivity is reduced due to 4 billion of variablerate loans being priced at floored rates at december 31 2020 which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 66 bps at december 31 2020 we also had 3 billion of variablerate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate consumer loans approximately 1 billion were priced at floored rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 35 bps see notes 3 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority regulating libor along with various other regulatory bodies announced that libor would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021 subsequent to that announcement 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

in november 2020 the financial conduct authority announced that many tenors of libor would continue to be published through june of 2023 bank regulators including the occ have instructed banks to discontinue new originations referencing libor as soon as possible but no later than december 2021 to facilitate the transition process we have instituted an enterprisewide program to identify assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of libor which includes active engagement with industry working groups and regulators this program includes active involvement of senior management with regular engagement from the enterprise risk management committee the program is structured with an emphasis towards minimizing client and internal business operational impacts providing transparency in reporting ensuring consistency and creating a central governance model that aligns with fasb irs and other regulatory guidance 

our focus has centered around operational readiness as well as the installation of processes and systems to validate that contract risk is clearly identified and understood new originations and any modifications or renewals of liborbased contracts contain fallback language to assist in an orderly transition upon selection of an alternative reference rate for the rest of our contracts that have a duration beyond december 31 2021 and that reference libor all fallback provisions and variations are currently being identified and sorted into classifications based upon those provisions upon classification the contracts will be remediated and monitored through defined workflow paths the goal is to clearly understand fallback provisions by loan and to have the entire portfolio in a state that simplifies ultimate conversion to a replacement index 

we have a significant number of assets and liabilities that reference libor such as commercial loans commercial real estate term loans adjustablerate mortgage loans unfunded loan commitments derivatives and debt securities as of december 31 2020 we had more than 38 billion of assets that reference libor consisting mostly of commercial loans the amount of borrowed funds that reference libor as of december 31 2020 was less than 1 billion these amounts exclude derivative assets and liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2020 the notional amount of our liborreferenced interest rate derivative contracts was more than 16 billion of which more than 10 billion related to contracts with central counterparty clearinghouses each of the liborreferenced amounts described above will vary in future periods as current contracts expire with potential replacement contracts using either libor with a fallback provision or an alternative reference rate in considering a replacement rate for libor indices used as reference rates in lending agreements the ideal rate would adjust for changes in the credit environment and have a term structure by contrast the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” is a riskfree overnight funding rate we along with other industry participants continue to explore alternative indices other than sofr which could be utilized as a replacement for libor 

market risk — fixed income 

we engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixedincome securities 

at december 31 2020 we had a relatively small amount 266 million of trading assets and 61 million of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 182 million and 66 million respectively at december 31 2019 

we are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value we are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2020 the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs securities increased by 229 million due largely to changes in the interest rate environment compared with a 257 million increase in the same prior year period 

market risk — equity investments 

through our equity investment activities we own equity securities that are publicly traded in addition we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and an fhlb that are not publicly traded the accounting for equity investments may use the cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs we are exposed to the possibility of 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by our equity investments committee consisting of members of management 

we hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly prepublic companies primarily through various sbic venture capital funds our equity exposure to these investments was approximately 135 million and 154 million at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively on occasion some of the companies within our sbic investments may issue an initial public offering in this case the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment which can introduce additional market risk 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity refers to our capacity to meet our cash and collateral obligations and to manage both expected and unexpected cash flows without adversely impacting our operations or financial strength sources of liquidity include both traditional forms of funding such as deposits borrowings and equity and unencumbered assets such as marketable loans and securities 

since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously described risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds for our customers’ credit needs capital plan actions anticipated financial and contractual obligations which include withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardapproved corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines such as a 30day liquidity coverage ratio that are used to monitor our liquidity positions as well as our various stress test and liquid asset measurements we perform liquidity stress tests and assess our portfolio of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under stress scenarios at december 31 2020 our investment securities portfolio of 166 billion and cash and money market investments of 74 billion collectively comprised 29 of total assets 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed by our treasury department under the direction of the corporate treasurer with oversight by alco the treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans and our liquidity policy these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policy also must be approved by the ermc and the board of directors we have adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk the policy requires us to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows in the event of a severe liquidity crisis throughout 2020 and as of december 31 2020 we complied with this policy 

liquidity regulation 

upon passage of the crapo bill we are no longer subject to the enhanced prudential standards for liquidity management reg yy however we continue to perform liquidity stress tests and assess our portfolio of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under the stress scenarios although we are no longer subject to the regulations of the final lcr rule we exceed the regulatory requirements that mandate a buffer of securities and other liquid assets to cover 70 of 30day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated therein 

liquidity management actions 

our consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements were 73 billion at december 31 2020 compared with 18 billion at december 31 2019 an increase of 55 billion during 2020 the primary sources of cash were from an increase in deposits and net cash provided by operating activities uses of cash during the same period were primarily from 1 loan originations and purchases 2 an increase in investment securities 3 a decrease in shortterm borrowings 4 repayment of longterm debt 5 dividends on common and preferred stock and 6 repurchases of our common stock 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

total deposits were 697 billion at december 31 2020 compared with 571 billion at december 31 2019 the 126 billion increase during 2020 was a result of an 89 billion and 58 billion increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits and savings and money market deposits respectively partially offset by a 21 billion decrease in time deposits the funding of ppp loan proceeds into customer deposit accounts contributed meaningfully to overall deposit growth our core deposits consisting of noninterestbearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits and time deposits under 250000 were 682 billion at december 31 2020 compared with 539 billion at december 31 2019 

at december 31 2020 maturities of our longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from august 2021 to october 2029 

our cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses decreased to 195 million during 2020 from 401 million during 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds and lower borrowed funds additionally we paid approximately 259 million of dividends on preferred and common stock during 2020 compared with 260 million during 2019 dividends paid per common share were 136 in 2020 compared to 128 in 2019 in february 2021 the board approved a quarterly common dividend of 034 per share 

general financial market and economic conditions impact our access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings all of the credit rating agencies rate our debt at an investmentgrade level although our credit ratings did not change during 2020 fitch and sp revised their outlook from stable to negative due to disruption in economic activity and financial markets from the covid19 pandemic and our oil and gas exposure our credit ratings and outlooks are presented in the following schedule 

schedule 36 

credit ratings 



the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and a significant source of funding zions bancorporation na is a member of the fhlb of des moines the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements we are required to invest in fhlb and federal reserve stock to maintain our borrowing capacity 

the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 171 billion at december 31 2020 compared with 153 billion at december 31 2019 loans with a carrying value of approximately 247 billion at december 31 2020 have been pledged at the fhlb of des moines and the federal reserve as collateral for current and potential borrowings compared with 215 million at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 we had no fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding compared with 10 billion of shortterm fhlb borrowings outstanding and no longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 our total investment in fhlb and federal reserve stock was 11 million and 98 million respectively compared with 50 million and 107 million at december 31 2019 

during 2020 the federal reserve established the paycheck protection program liquidity facility “ppplf” under the ppplf we will be able to obtain term financing for ppp loans by pledging them to the frb prior to march 31 2021 in deciding whether to utilize the ppplf as a funding source we will take into account our current funding position and our expectation of early ppp redemption through loan forgiveness although the ppplf will 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

cease after march 31 2021 we will also have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity at the fhlb of des moines by pledging the ppp loans the ability to pledge ppp loans to the fhlb of des moines does not have a defined expiry and funding terms may vary 

our afs investment securities are primarily held as a source of contingent liquidity we target securities that can be easily turned into cash through sale or repurchase agreements and whose value remains relatively stable during market disruptions we regularly manage our shortterm funding needs through secured borrowing with the securities pledged as collateral interest rate risk management is another consideration for selection of investment securities our afs securities balances increased by 20 billion during 2020 

our loantototal deposit ratio was 77 at december 31 2020 compared with 85 at december 31 2019 reflecting higher deposit growth in 2020 relative to loan growth 

if our operating investing and deposit activities do not provide the loan funding required we may rely on more expensive wholesale funding for a portion of our loan growth our use of borrowed funds both short and longterm decreased by 868 million during 2020 as our deposit growth more than adequately funded our loan growth during the period due to the increase in average deposits of 86 billion during 2020 and with average loans only increasing 47 billion the surplus cash went to paying down borrowings and increasing shortterm investments which increased 55 billion from december 31 2019 

we may also from time to time issue additional preferred stock senior or subordinated notes or other forms of capital or debt instruments depending on our capital funding assetliability management or other needs as market conditions warrant and subject to any required regulatory approvals management believes that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably foreseeable shortterm and intermediateterm demands 

contractual obligations 

schedule 37 summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 

schedule 37 

contractual obligations 



1 indeterminable maturity deposits include noninterestbearing demand savings and money market 

2 commitments to make venture and other noninterestbearing investments do not have defined maturity dates they are due upon demand and may be drawn immediately or as late as after five years therefore these commitments are shown as having indeterminable maturities 

3 the maturities on longterm debt do not include the associated hedges 

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 37 we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business some of these contracts are renewable or cancellable at least annually and in certain cases to secure favorable pricing concessions we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

we also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

operational technology and cyber risk management 

operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events in our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk we have an erm department whose responsibility is to help employees management and the board of directors to assess understand measure manage and monitor risk in accordance with our risk management framework we have documented both controls and the control selfassessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and the fdicia 

to manage and minimize our operational risk we have in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate our systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to those systems to our legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by our compliance risk management internal audit and credit examination departments reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data in addition the data governance department has key governance surrounding data integrity and availability oversight further we have key programs and procedures to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters we also mitigate certain operational risks through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

we continually strive to improve our oversight of operational risk including enhancement of risk identification risk and control selfassessments and antifraud measures which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees the operational risk committee reports to the ermc which reports to the roc key measures have been established in line with our risk management framework to increase oversight by erm and operational risk management through the strengthening of new initiative reviews and enhancements to enterprise supply chain and vendor risk management we also continue to enhance and strengthen the enterprise business continuity program enterprise security program and enterprise incident management reporting 

significant enhancements have also been made to governance technology and reporting including the establishment of policy and committee governance programs the implementation of a governance risk and control solution and the creation of an enterprise risk profile and operational risk profile in addition our enterprise exam management department has standardized our response and reporting and increased our effectiveness and efficiencies with regulatory examination communications and issues management 

we continue to make significant investments to mature our technology capabilities and to eliminate the risk from outdated and unsupported technologies technology debt this includes updating core banking systems as well as introducing new digital customerfacing capabilities technology projects initiatives and operations are governed by a change management framework that assesses the activities and risk within our business processes to limit disruption and resource constraints change initiative status and risks are reviewed regularly by the change initiatives and technology committee that includes among other senior executives the ceo cfo coo and cro initiative risk and change impact from the framework are reported to the roc 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

technology governance is also in place at the operational level within our enterprise and technology operations eto division to help ensure safety soundness operational resiliency and compliance with our cybersecurity requirements eto management teams participate in enterprise architecture review boards and technology risk councils to address such issues as enterprise standards compliance and strategic alignment cyber vulnerability management endoflife audit risk and compliance issue management and asset management thresholds are defined to escalate risks in these areas to the attention of the orc and ermc committees as appropriate 

the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our systems — sometimes referred to as hacking cyber fraud cyberattacks or other similar names — continues to grow to combat the everincreasing sophistication of cyberattacks we are continuously improving methods for detecting and preventing attacks in addition we have implemented policies and procedures and developed specific training for our employees and elevated our oversight and internal reporting to the board and respective committees further we regularly engage independent thirdparty cyber experts to test for vulnerabilities in our environment we also conduct our own internal simulations and tabletop exercises as well as participate in financial sectorspecific exercises we have engaged consultants at both the strategic level and at the technology implementation level to assist us in better managing this critical risk 

while we have significant internal resources policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems we have experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past and there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur in the future or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed it is impossible to determine the potential effects of these events with any certainty but any such breach could result in material adverse consequences for us and our customers 

capital management 

overview 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” chaired by the chief financial officer and consisting of members of management whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern our capital management other major cmc responsibilities include 

• setting overall capital targets within the boardapproved capital policy monitoring performance compared with our capital policy limits and recommending changes to capital including dividends common stock issuances and repurchases subordinated debt and changes in major strategies to maintain ourselves at wellcapitalized levels 

• maintaining an adequate capital cushion to withstand adverse stress events while continuing to meet the borrowing needs of our customers and to provide reasonable assurance of continued access to wholesale funding consistent with fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders and 

• reviewing our agency ratings 

we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence we have a fundamental financial objective to consistently improve riskadjusted returns on our shareholders’ capital specifically it is our policy to 

• maintain sufficient capital to support current needs 

• maintain an adequate capital cushion to withstand adverse stress events while continuing to meet borrowing needs of our customers and 

• meet fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders while managing capital distributions to shareholders through dividends and repurchases of common stock so as to be consistent with 12 usc § 56 and § 60 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

our primary regulator is the occ we continue to be subject to examinations by the cfpb with respect to consumer financial regulations under the national bank act and occ regulations certain capital transactions may be subject to the approval of the occ 

we continue to utilize stress testing as the primary mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital and capital actions based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions the results of our internal stress tests are publicly available on our website the timing and amount of capital actions are subject to various factors including our financial performance business needs prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and occ approval 

capital management actions 

weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 209 million from 2019 to 2020 respectively the decrease from 2019 was primarily due to the expiration of outofthe money common stock warrants and a lower average bank common share price on may 22 2020 292 million common stock warrants nasdaq zionw expired each common stock warrant was convertible into 110 shares at an exercise price of 3331 

total shareholders’ equity has increased moderately and was 79 billion at december 31 2020 compared with 74 billion at december 31 2019 the increase during 2020 was primarily due to net income of 539 million and a 229 million aftertax increase in unrealized gains on afs securities which was due largely to changes in the interest rate environment the increase was partially offset by 259 million of common and preferred stock dividends paid and 75 million of repurchases of our common stock from our publicly announced plans common stock and additional paidin capital decreased 49 million or 2 during 2020 primarily due to common stock repurchases 

during 2020 we repurchased 17 million shares of common stock from our publicly announced plans or 1 of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2019 for 75 million at an average price of 4502 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2020 we suspended share repurchase activity due to the onset of the covid19 pandemic in february 2021 we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock from our publicly announced plans with a fair value of 50 million at an average price of 4978 we expect to maintain the appropriate amount of capital to cover inherent risk the timing and amount of any additional common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors including our financial performance business needs prevailing economic conditions stress testing and occ approval the magnitude timing and form of capital return will be determined by the board shares may be repurchased occasionally in the open market through privately negotiated transactions utilizing rule 10b51 plans or otherwise 

under the occ’s “earnings limitation rule” our dividend payments are restricted to an amount equal to the sum of the total of 1 our net income for that year and 2 retained earnings for the preceding two years unless the occ approves the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount as of january 1 2021 we had 761 million of retained net profits available for distribution 

we paid common dividends of 225 million during 2020 compared with 226 million during 2019 in february 2021 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 034 per common share payable on february 25 2021 to shareholders of record on february 18 2021 we also paid dividends on preferred stock of 34 million for both 2020 and 2019 

cecl 

we elected to phasein the regulatory capital effects of the adoption of cecl as allowed by federal bank agencies and as described in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements at december 31 2020 the application of these provisions improved our cet1 tier 1 riskbased and total riskbased capital ratios by 10 bps each and our tier 1 leverage capital ratio by 6 bps 

basel iii 

we are subject to basel iii capital requirements to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios we met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules as of december

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies described below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to our financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording our financial transactions is important to have a complete picture of our financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

allowance for credit losses 

the acl includes the alll and the rulc for periods prior to 2020 the alll represented management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio at that time the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance was based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process included both quantitative and qualitative analyses as well as a qualitative review of the results which required a significant amount of judgment 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the rulc provided for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit for periods prior to 2020 the reserve was estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the alll in addition to assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

on january 1 2020 we adopted asu 201613 or cecl upon adoption of the asu we recorded the full amount of the acl for loans and leases of 526 million compared with 554 million at december 31 2019 resulting in an aftertax increase to retained earnings of 20 million the impact of the adoption of cecl for our securities portfolio was less than 1 million 

the cecl allowance is calculated based on quantitative models and management qualitative judgment based on many factors over the life of loan the primary assumptions of the cecl quantitative model are the economic forecast the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period the length of the reversion period prepayment rates and the credit quality of the portfolio 

as a result of this accounting standard our acl has become more volatile our acl was 835 million as of december 31 2020 compared with 917 million as of september 30 2020 and 526 million as of january 1 2020 we expect volatility to continue primarily because under the cecl methodology the acl is subject to economic forecasts that may change materially from period to period although we believe that our methodology for determining an appropriate level for the acl adequately addresses the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses 

for example if the acl was evaluated on only one baseline scenario rather than probability weighting four scenarios the quantitatively determined amount of the acl at december 31 2020 would decrease by approximately 167 million additionally if the probability of default risk grade for all passgraded loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal riskgrading scale the quantitatively determined amount of the acl at december 31 2020 would increase by approximately 87 million these sensitivity analyses are hypothetical and have been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in forecasts and changes in risk grades may have on the acl estimate see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the processes and methodologies used to estimate the acl 

fair value estimates 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements gaap has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as our own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than the carrying value of the item being valued considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available we are required to make judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously described 

afs securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors afs securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of impairment if we have an intent to sell an identified security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis then we recognize an impairment equal to any existing allowance written off against the security if we do not have the intent to sell a security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell a security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis then we determine whether there is any impairment attributable to creditrelated factors 

notes 1 3  5 7 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the “investment securities portfolio” on page 51 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value in the financial statements of a reporting unit at the time of its acquisition and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this annual test at the beginning of the fourth quarter or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of our reporting units inclusive of goodwill is less than fair value the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount inclusive of goodwill is more likely than not to exceed its fair value additional quantitative analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any of goodwill impairment our reporting units with goodwill are amegy cbt and zions bank 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we historically have used a combination of up to three separate quantitative methods comparable publicly traded commercial banks in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of commercial banks in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows the transaction value approach was not used in the 2020 goodwill analysis due to the lack of comparable transactions that occurred in 2020 acquisition activity declined in 2020 which was likely due to the economic uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic 

critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations may include 

• selection of comparable publicly traded companies based on location size and business focus and composition 

• selection of market comparable acquisition transactions if available based on location size business focus and composition and date of the transaction 

• the discount rate which is based on our estimate of the cost of equity capital 

• the projections of future earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

• the relative weight given to the valuations derived by the three methods described and 

• the control premium associated with reporting units 

we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how we are managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within our geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that up to a 25 control premium for the reporting units was appropriate 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment test computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on our reporting units fair value and the goodwill impairment amount if any estimates include economic conditions which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect our regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective october 1 2020 we concluded that none of our reporting units were impaired furthermore the evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 12 28 and 44 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings was increased by 100 bps the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 9 24 and 39 respectively

competition 

the bank operates in a highly competitive environment the bank’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks credit unions and thrifts including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the bank competes with finance companies mutual funds insurance companies brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies financial technology and other nontraditional lending and banking companies and a variety of other types of companies these companies may have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include the quality of service delivered our local community knowledge convenience of office locations online banking functionality and other delivery methods range of products offered pricing and the overall relationship with our clients the bank must compete effectively along all of these dimensions to remain successful 

supervision and regulation 

this section describes the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the bank the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable laws or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted however they may have a material effect on the business and results of the bank 

on september 30 2018 we completed the merger of zions bancorporation the bank’s former holding company with and into zions bancorporation na sometimes referred to herein as the “restructuring” more information 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

about the restructuring and its effects can be found in the proxy statement filed by zions bancorporation with the sec on july 24 2018 in connection with completing the restructuring we also received approval of an application filed with the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” seeking a determination that the bank is not “systemically important” as defined by provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers and taxpayers these regulations are not however generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors and in fact may have the consequence of reducing returns to our shareholders banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry which have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders 

legislative changes to laws governing the financial industry occur frequently some of this legislation materially affects the manner in which we and other financial institutions operate including increasing the costs and other burdens of conducting our businesses in addition the banking agencies regularly promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations which also have significant impact on the financial industry the content and impact of such regulatory changes cannot presently be determined the bank is committed to both satisfying regulatory expectations and providing attractive shareholder returns however given the everevolving regulatory environment the results of these efforts cannot yet be known 

general 

the bank is subject to the provisions of the national bank act and other statutes governing national banks as well as the rules and regulations of the occ the cfpb and the fdic it is also subject to examination and supervision by the occ and examination by the cfpb in respect of federal consumer financial regulations the bank as well as some of its subsidiaries is also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies these regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec financial industry regulatory authority “finra” andor state securities regulators 

the national bank act 

prior to the restructuring zions bancorporation’s corporate affairs were governed by utah state law and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws including the securities act of 1933 “securities act” and the securities exchange act of 1934 “exchange act” as administered by the sec each of these legal regimes is welldeveloped and used widely by public companies 

following the restructuring the bank’s corporate affairs are governed by the national bank act and related regulations administered by the occ with respect to securities matters the bank is not subject to the securities act but is subject to occ regulations governing securities offerings the bank’s common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the exchange act which vests the occ with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the exchange act applicable to banks such as the bank though the bank continues to make filings required by the exchange act with the sec as a voluntary filer these statutory and regulatory regimes are not as well developed as the corporate and securities law regimes applicable to many other publicly held corporations see discussion under “ risk factors ” 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act and related regulations broadly affect the financial services industry among other things the doddfrank act involves mandatory divestiture of certain equity investments increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector 

regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act require many banks to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets than was generally the case prior to the enactment of the doddfrank act and limit the forms of capital 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

that such banks rely upon for regulatory purposes certain bank holding companies and other financial institutions known as systemically important financial institutions sifis are required to adhere to “enhanced prudential supervision” requirements of the doddfrank act and the annual comprehensive capital analysis “ccar” process administered by the frb which in effect requires sifis to maintain capital based on hypothetical scenarios dictated by the frb as a result of the restructuring and fsoc approval the bank is no longer subject to these requirements however the bank continues to be subject to the occ’s heightened standard guidelines which establish enhanced requirements for national banks with assets of 50 billion or more and other regulatory requirements that reduce its flexibility to return capital to shareholders and respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions additionally in may 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act also known as “the crapo bill” was signed into law reducing regulatory requirements for many banking institutions and exempting the bank from the capital planning actions as required by the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and the pricing of certain products and services including the following 

• the assessment base for federal deposit insurance was changed to consolidated assets less tangible capital instead of the amount of insured deposits 

• the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on business transaction accounts was repealed 

• the frb was authorized to issue and did issue regulations governing debit card interchange fees 

the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining large financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws restricting the scope of federal preemption could burden national banks with the requirement that they also comply with certain state laws covering matters already covered by federal law in addition the doddfrank act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

the bank and other companies subject to the doddfrank act are subject to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules these restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act include documentation and governance deferral riskbalancing and clawback requirements any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or engage in other activities or could result in regulatory enforcement actions 

during the second quarter of 2016 the us financial regulators including the frb and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets including the bank the proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion such as the bank and further more stringent requirements for those with total consolidated assets of at least 250 billion the general qualitative requirements include i prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation ii prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss iii establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward iv requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and v mandating appropriate recordkeeping for larger financial institutions including the bank the proposed revised regulations would also introduce very prescriptive requirements relating to the types and percentages the timing of the realization and the risk of forfeiture of incentive compensation awarded to “senior executive officers” and “significant risktakers” the regulators have not yet issued any final rules 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

capital standards – basel framework 

in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the basel iii capital rules effectively replaced the basel i capital rules and implemented the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revised the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the bank compared to the basel i us riskbased capital rules the basel iii capital rules became effective for the bank on january 1 2015 and were subject to phasein periods for certain of their components in november 2017 the frb fdic and occ published a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain us basel iii capital rules for nonadvanced approaches banks such as the bank effective january 1 2018 the final rule retains the 2017 basel iii transitional treatment of certain dtas and mortgage servicing assets among others as a result since january 1 2018 our dtas and mortgage servicing assets retained their 2017 risk weight treatment until the federal banking regulators revise the extended transitional treatment under the november 2017 transitional rule 

the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replaced the riskweighting approach derived from basel i capital accords of the basel committee with a more risksensitive approach based in part on the standardized approach in the basel committee’s 2004 basel ii capital accords the basel iii capital rules also implemented the requirements of section 939a of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules 

the basel iii capital rules among other things i introduced a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” ii specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements iii applied most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and iv expanded the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared to prior regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows 

• 45 cet1 to riskweighted assets 

• 60 tier 1 capital ie cet1 plus additional tier 1 to riskweighted assets 

• 80 total capital ie tier 1 plus tier 2 to riskweighted assets and 

• 40 tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the “leverage ratio” 

as of january 1 2019 the basel iii capital rules also require the bank to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effect not reflected in net income 

the basel iii capital rules also prescribed a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expanded the riskweighting categories from basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures to 1250 for certain securitization exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules provided more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

qualifying central counterparty and increased the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

the basel iii capital rules provided for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights dtas dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 the application of this part of the rule did not result in any deductions from cet1 for us 

under prior basel i capital standards the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” items included in capital were excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios as a “nonadvanced approaches banking organization” we made a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items as allowed under the basel iii capital rules 

basel iii also required additional regulatory capital disclosures to be made that are commonly referred to as “pillar 3” disclosures these disclosures require the bank to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding its capital structure adequacy and riskweighted assets the bank began publishing these pillar 3 disclosures in 2015 and such disclosures are available on the bank’s website 

the basel committee has issued a series of updates that propose other changes to capital regulations in one of these the basel committee finalized a revised framework for calculating minimum capital requirements for market risk which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations the basel committee has set an effective date for reporting under the revised framework for market risk capital of january 1 2022 the us federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these revisions for us banking organizations the bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules as of december 31 2019 

capital planning and stress testing 

as a result of the successful completion of the restructuring and fsoc approval described elsewhere in this report and the enactment of the crapo bill the bank is no longer required to participate in the frb’s ccar process or publicly disclose the results of stress testing or the bank’s proposed capital actions we continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypotheticallystressed economic conditions the stress test results reflect a set of forwardlooking stress tests based upon hypothetical economic scenarios the bank utilizes a moodys baseline scenario based on a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy moody’s protracted slump scenario a downside 4 scenario is the primary stress scenario considered by the bank for its internal stress scenario certain variables of which are adjusted by the bank to test certain idiosyncrasies that may be unique to the bank detailed disclosure of the bank’s 2019 internal stress test results can be found on our website the 2019 results of the stress test indicated that the bank would maintain capital ratios at levels adequate for its risk profile throughout the ninequarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test 

liquidity 

historically reg ulation and monitoring of bank liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter both in the united states and internationally without required formulaic measures however in january 2016 the frb and other banking regulators adopted final rules “final liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” rule” implementing a us version of the basel committee’s lcr requirement the lcr is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of securities and other liquid assets to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30day stress scenario the final lcr rule applies to large internationally active banking organizations those with at least 250 billion in total assets or at least 10 billion in onbalance sheet foreign exposure although as a result of the restructuring the lcr regulation does not apply to zions bancorporation the bank uses many of the factors embedded in the lcr calculation to determine an appropriate level of highly liquid assets furthermore the bank utilizes internal liquidity stress tests as its primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

including but not limited to holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets maintaining levels of readily available contingency funding concentrations of funding sources and maturity profile of liabilities 

financial privacy and cyber security 

the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties including provisions of the grammleachbliley act dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal information of individual customers these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addressed five categories of cyber standards 1 cyber risk governance 2 cyber risk management 3 internal dependency management 4 external dependency management and 5 incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness the comment period expired in february 2017 however the regulators have not yet issued any revised proposed rules or final rules 

state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements in june 2018 the california legislature passed the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” which took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa which covers businesses that obtain or access personal information on california resident consumers grants consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over their personal information and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to consumer data privacy rights some of the rights afforded to california resident consumers also extend to california employees though the california legislature exempted certain employee information and employer usage from some of the act’s provisions until at least january 1 2021 other states have implemented or are considering similar privacy laws we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate 

in may 2018 the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data we believe the applicability of the gdpr to us is minimal as we do not offer goods or services to eu residents or monitor their behaviors data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly remain a focus of state and federal regulators and will continue to have a significant impact on the banks risk management practices 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia as modified by the basel iii capital rules an insured depository institution generally will be classified as wellcapitalized if it 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 in addition an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its cet1 ratio is under 45 its total riskbased capital ratio is less than 8 its tier 1 riskbased capital ratio is less than 6 or its tier 1 leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator 

other regulations 

the bank is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which it and its subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

• limitations on dividends payable to shareholders the bank’s ability to pay dividends on both its common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

• safety and soundness requirements federal law requires that the bank be operated in a safe and sound manner we are subject to additional safety and soundness standards prescribed in the fdicia including standards related to internal controls information systems internal audit loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies the safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in their supervisory authority over us 

• requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities and restrictions on other activities the national bank act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and do not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of a nonaffiliated nonbank see discussion under “ risk factors ” other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities 

• limits on bank organization activities which are more limited than activities that can be conducted by bank holding company organizations 

• limitations on the amount of loans to a borrower and its affiliates 

• limitations on transactions with affiliates as expanded by the doddfrank act 

• restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain securities 

• requirements for opening of branches and the acquisition of other financial entities 

• fair lending and truth in lending requirements to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions 

• brokerdealer and investment advisory regulations one of our subsidiaries is a brokerdealer that is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and other brokerdealer activities this company is registered with the sec and is a member of finra another subsidiary is a registered investment adviser under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended and as such is supervised by the sec certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to various us federal and state laws and regulations these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws 

• community reinvestment act “cra” requirements the cra requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities including providing credit to low and moderate income individuals if the bank fails to adequately serve its communities penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates and merge with or purchase other financial institutions a notice of proposed rulemaking “npr” issued jointly by the fdic and occ in november 2019 proposes certain amendments to the cra including changes in what qualifies for cra credit where cra activity counts what method should be used to measure cra activity and how banks should collect record and report data the npr is subject to a public comment period although the npr proposes to make changes to the cra regulatory framework it is too early to predict the content or effects of any final rulemaking that may result from the npr 

• antimoney laundering regulations the bank secrecy act title iii of the uniting and strengthening of america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 “usa patriot act” and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist us government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering terrorist financing and other suspicious activity 

the bank is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 certain provisions of the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information the national association of securities dealers automated quotations “nasdaq” has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the bank has overseen management’s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk practices this system includes policies and guidelines such as corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of bank stock by insiders and charters for the executive audit risk oversight compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the bank’s corporate governance practices is available on the bank’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom the bank’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the bank has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the bank management monitors these laws and regulations and regularly reviews and updates its policies procedures and controls in anticipation of industry and regulatory changes 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the bank cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the bank are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the bank is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the bank frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

the bank’s growth strategy is driven by key factors while adhering to defined risk parameters the key elements of the bank’s strategy reflect its prudent risktaking philosophy the bank generates revenue by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks these factors are outlined in the bank’s risk appetite framework 

the bank’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee of the board approved an enterprise risk management framework and appointed an enterprise risk management committee “ermc” to oversee and implement the framework the ermc is comprised of senior management of the bank and is chaired by the chief risk officer the bank’s most significant risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in prudent extension of credit to relationship customers in addition to credit risk these committees also monitor the following level one risk areas market and interest rate risk liquidity risk strategic business and corporate governance risk operationaltechnology risk cyber risk capitalfinancial reporting risk legalcompliance risk including regulatory risk and reputational risk as outlined in the bank’s risk taxonomy additional governance and oversight includes boardapproved policies and management committees with direct focus on these specific risk categories 

although not comprehensive the following describes several risk factors that are significant to the bank

credit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks a decline in the strength of the us economy in general or the local economies in which we conduct operations could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses “alll” 

we have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio including loans secured by real estate leveraged and enterprise value lending and oil and gasrelated lending which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results 

concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the bank concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the bank due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk 

we engage in commercial construction and land acquisition and development lending as well as commercial term lending primarily in our western states footprint the bank as a whole has relatively larger concentrations of such lending than many other peer institutions in addition we have a concentration in oil and gasrelated lending primarily in texas both commercial real estate “cre” and oil and gasrelated lending are subject to specific risks including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateralvalues and activity levels in addition our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states and values there may behave differently than in other parts of the united states we may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the united states 

the bank provides a full range of banking and related services through its local management teams and unique brands in arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah washington and wyoming approximately 76 and 75 of the bank’s total net interest income relates to our banking operations in utah texas and california for the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively as a result of this geographic concentration our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results for example our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events at december 31 2019 loan 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

balances associated with our banking operations in utah texas and california comprised 79 of the bank’s commercial lending portfolio 72 of the cre lending portfolio and 72 of the consumer lending portfolio 

we could be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

adverse economic conditions negatively affect the bank’s assets including its loan and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition the most recent financial crisis resulted in significant regulatory changes that continue to affect the bank although economic conditions have improved since the most recent financial crisis it is possible that economic conditions may weaken economic and fiscal conditions in the united states and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic and market conditions faced by the bank and its customers any sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions would adversely affect the bank 

market and interest rate risk 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the bank’s revenue a prolonged period of low interest rates can have a materially adverse impact on the banks net interest income and result in declining net interest margins interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability management committee which is established by the bank’s board of directors failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect the bank factors beyond the bank’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the bank’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb as interest rates decline our cost of funds may not decline commensurately 

some components of the bank’s balance sheet are very sensitive to rising and falling rates over the course of the last year we actively reduced this assetsensitivity through various strategies such as entering into rate floor agreements and increasing the use of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to synthetically convert floatingrate assets to fixedrate we anticipate maintaining a moderately assetsensitive position in 2020 but the assetliability committee “alco” continues to monitor market developments and may adjust strategies accordingly 

interest rates on the bank’s financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to libor which could adversely impact the bank’s revenue expenses and value of those financial instruments 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority regulating the london interbank offered rate “libor” along with various other regulatory bodies announced that libor would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021 libor makes up the most liquid and common interest rate index in the world and is commonly referenced in financial instruments we have exposure to libor in various aspects through our financial contracts instruments that may be impacted include loans securities and derivatives among other financial contracts indexed to libor and that mature after december 31 2021 

while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to libor the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of us financial market participants selected by the federal reserve bank of new york started in may 2018 to publish the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as an alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by treasury securities that was selected by the alternative reference rate committee due to the depth and robustness of the us treasury repurchase market at this time it is impossible to predict whether sofr will become an accepted alternative to libor 

the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate such as sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

• adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on the revenue and expenses associate with and the value of our floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s role in determining market interest rates globally 

• prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate 

• result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased securities and 

• require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark such as sofr 

the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain 

liquidity risk 

changes in sources of liquidity and capital and liquidity requirements may limit our operations and potential growth 

our primary source of liquidity is our supply of deposits from our customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customers maintaining those deposits with us recently competition for deposits has increased and interest rates paid on deposits have generally risen while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for changes in our deposit funding marketrelated forces and a wide variety of other events could impact the liquidity value we derive from our deposits 

liquidity requirements and sources are also subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the occ and the fdic including riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements as well as basel iii liquidity requirements capital needs may rise above normal levels when we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition risk profile and growth plans for a summary of the capital rules to which we are subject see “capital standards – basel framework” on page 9 of this annual report on form 10k 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us and particular classes of securities that we issue the rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies ratings downgrades to us or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our liquidity position financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

strategic business and corporate governance risks 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us information security and vendor management processes are in place to actively identify manage and monitor actual and potential impacts 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations that limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

we have made and are continuing to make significant changes to the bank that include among other things organizational restructurings efficiency initiatives and replacement or upgrades of certain core technological systems to improve our control environment and operating efficiency the ultimate success and completion of these changes and their effect on the bank may vary significantly from initial planning which could materially adversely affect the bank 

over the last several years the bank has completed numerous improvement projects including the merger of its bank holding company into the bank combining the legal charters of our seven affiliate banks into one consolidating 15 loan operations sites into two replacing our core loan systems upgrading our accounting systems installing a credit origination work flow system streamlining our small business and retail lending mortgage wealth management and foreign exchange businesses and investing in data quality and information security ongoing investment continues in a multiyear project to replace our core deposit systems a collection of customerfacing digital capabilities and a variety of other projects to simplify how we do business the bank has taken actions designed to improve efficiencies and reduce and manage operating expenses in part to address the challenges to net interest income presented by the current low and declining interest rate environment 

these initiatives and changes continue to be implemented some of the projects are fully completed and some projects are in their early stages by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings expected efficiencies and related items are subject to change and significant variability there can be no certainty that the bank will achieve the expected benefits or other intended results associated with these projects 

we may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these changes these may include significant time delays cost overruns loss of key people technological problems processing failures vendor reliance issues and other adverse developments any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems processes control environment procedures and employees which may adversely impact our customers and our ability to conduct business 

we have plans policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these potential adverse developments however there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately remediated the ultimate effect of any adverse development could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect the bank including its control environment operating efficiency and results of operations 

operationaltechnology risk 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods prolonged drought and pandemics may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and the bank 

the bank has significant operations and a significant customer base in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy the bank’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to the bank’s property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the bank’s customers and in turn on the bank although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the bank’s operating results 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

we have established internal controls over financial reporting and other operations within the bank because of its inherent limitations internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the bank we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations these efforts also include the management of controls to mitigate operational risks for programs and processes across the bank 

we could be adversely affected by financial technology advancements and other nontraditional lending and banking sources 

financial technology companies referred to as “fintechs” and technology platform companies continue to emerge and compete with traditional financial institutions across a wide variety of products and services consumers have demonstrated a growing willingness to obtain banking services from fintechs as a result our ability to remain competitive is increasingly dependent upon our ability to maintain critical technological capabilities and to identify and develop new valueadded products for existing and future customers failure to do so could impede our time to market reduce customer satisfaction and product accessibility and adaptation and weaken our competitive position 

we use models in the management of the bank there is risk that these models are incorrect or inaccurate in various ways which can cause us to make nonoptimal decisions 

we attempt to carefully develop document back test and validate the models used in the management of the bank for example we use models in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk models used in projecting stress losses in various segments of our credit and securities portfolios and models projecting net revenue under stress models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons and cannot perfectly predict outcomes management decisions based in part on such models therefore can be suboptimal in addition when determining the bank’s capital needs under stress testing we attempt to specifically quantify the amounts by which model results could be incorrect 

cyber risk 

we are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

the board and the risk committee of the board have invested significant time on overseeing managements efforts to continue to strengthen our infrastructure staffing and enhance our controls while improving the client and customer experience cyber defense and improving our resiliency against cybersecurity threats remains a key focus at all levels of management within the bank and of our board 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations information security risks for large financial institutions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies eg internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external third parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks 

in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment any failure interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems misappropriation of funds and theft disclosure or misuse of proprietary bank or customer data while we have significant internal resources policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems the bank has 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past and there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur in the future or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed it is impossible to determine the potential effects of these events with any certainty but any such breach could result in material adverse consequences for the bank and its customers 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we will be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

vendor risk 

we outsource various operations to third party vendors which could adversely impact our business and operational performance 

we rely on various vendors to perform operational activities to conduct our business we have established operational controls and monitoring through our third party vendor management programs to oversee and manage these vendors to help ensure they adhere to the same business practices that we as a bank have to either adhere or comply with we have developed and implemented service level agreements sla to assist us in that effort and have implemented regular reporting to monitor and manage our third party vendors 

capitalfinancial reporting risk 

internal stress testing and capital management as well as provisions of the national bank act and occ regulations may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

although we are no longer subject to the ccar regime we are required to submit stress tests to the occ because the bank has assets in excess of 10 billion and we continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypotheticallystressed economic conditions the stress testing and other applicable regulatory requirements may among other things require us to increase our capital levels limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under the national bank act and occ regulations certain capital transaction may be subject to the approval of the occ these requirements may limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the bank 

the bank must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by its banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions as well as the particular conditions risk profiles and growth plans of the bank compliance with capital requirements may limit the bank’s ability to expand and has required and may require the bank or its subsidiaries to raise additional capital these uncertainties and risks including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties may increase the bank’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk 

the bank is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the bank uses a number of complex financial products and services for its own capital funding investment and risk management needs in 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

addition to providing them to its customers estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the bank to comply before their formal adoption therefore identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

as of december 31 2019 the bank had 1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to amegy bank “amegy” california bank  trust “cbt” and zions bank if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value the bank may have to take a charge related to the impairment of its goodwill such a charge would occur if the bank were to experience increases in the book value of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in the fair value of equity of a reporting unit a significant decline in the bank’s expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the bank’s common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein may necessitate the bank taking charges in the future related to the impairment of its goodwill if the bank was to conclude in the future that a writedown of its goodwill is necessary it would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on the bank’s results of operations 

the bank may not be able to utilize the dta recorded on its balance sheet 

the bank’s balance sheet includes a dta we had net dtas of 37 million at december 31 2019 compared with 130 million at december 31 2018 the largest component of this asset results from additions to our alll for purposes of gaap in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes our ability to continue to record this dta is dependent on the bank’s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital in addition inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations currently no dtas are disallowed for regulatory purposes at the bank 

legalcompliance risk 

laws and regulations applicable to the bank and the financial services industry impose significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the bank and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel systems consulting and other costs in order to comply with banking regulations including those promulgated under the doddfrank act see “supervision and regulation” on page 6 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about the regulations applicable to the bank and the financial services industry generally 

bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits accordingly we are subject to fdic insurance assessments 

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted however if adopted some of these proposals could adversely affect the bank by among other things impacting aftertax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting the bank’s ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of the bank’s funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that the bank could offer and requiring the bank to raise capital at inopportune times 

political developments may also result in substantial changes in tax international trade immigration and other policies the extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain as are the potential direct and indirect impacts whether beneficial or adverse regulations and laws may be modified or repealed and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be adopted 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings the bank’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties eg civil money penalties under applicable banking laws injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations including those relating to antimoney laundering matters have been increasing dramatically in addition any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings which may restrict or limit our activities 

the corporate and securities laws applicable to the bank are not as welldeveloped as those applicable to a statechartered corporation which may impact the ability of the bank to effect corporate transactions in an efficient and optimal manner 

prior to the restructuring the corporate affairs of the bank’s holding company were governed by utah state law and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws including the securities act and the exchange act as administered by the sec each of these legal regimes is welldeveloped and used widely by public companies 

postrestructuring the bank’s corporate affairs are governed by the national bank act and related regulations administered by the occ with respect to securities matters the bank is not subject to the securities act but rather to occ regulations governing securities offerings the bank’s common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the exchange act which vests the occ with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the exchange act applicable to banks such as the bank though the bank currently makes and intends to continue to make filings required by the exchange act with the sec as a “voluntary filer” these occ statutory and regulatory regimes have been used by publiclytraded banking organizations relatively rarely and are not as welldeveloped as the corporate and securities law regimes applicable to corporations while certain specific risks associated with operating under these regimes are discussed below unless and until these regimes are further developed and established over time the uncertainty of how these regimes might apply to any given corporate or securities matters may prevent us from effecting transactions in an efficient and optimal manner or perhaps at all 

differences between the national bank act and state law requirements in respect of mergers could result in the bank not being able to execute acquisitions as efficiently and advantageously as bank holding companies or other financial institutions 

unlike state corporate law the national bank act requires shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for exceptions in the case of various “minor” mergers such as a parent company’s merger with a subsidiary or an acquirer’s merger with an unaffiliated entity in which the shares issued by the acquirer do not exceed a designated percentage the national bank act and related regulations may also complicate the structuring of certain nonbank acquisitions 

these differences could adversely affect the ability of the bank and other banks registered under the national bank act to efficiently consummate acquisition transactions in addition such differences could make the bank less competitive as a potential acquirer in certain circumstances given that the bank’s acquisition proposal may be conditioned on bank shareholder approval while the bank’s competitors’ proposals will not have such a condition 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

differences between the national bank act and state law could result in the bank’s capacity to pay dividends and repurchase shares at any given time being different from the capacity that existed for zions bancorporation prior to the restructuring 

the regulations and limitations applicable to the bank relating to the payment of dividends and repurchases or redemptions of outstanding common and preferred shares differ from the limitations and considerations that applied to the bank’s holding company prior to the recent restructuring while the bank does not believe this change in legal restrictions resulting from the restructuring will constrain the bank from executing any capital plans that are currently contemplated or otherwise reasonably foreseeable in the near term there can be no assurance that the change in legal restrictions will not have an adverse effect on the bank’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase or redeem stock in the future 

shares of common stock of a national bank are assessable which may cause investors to view the bank’s common stock less favorably than that of zions bancorporation prior to the restructuring 

the national bank act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable ie holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the occ in contrast the common stock of state corporations is not subject to assessment however the occ has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the national bank act assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank’s stock the bank’s common stock has a par value of 0001 moreover according to the occ it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation including robust capital standards prompt corrective action requirements and supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level nonetheless potential investors may be unfamiliar with the concept of assessment and as a result view the bank less favorably as an investment 

the ability of investors to access financial and other reports filed by the bank readily could be adversely affected if such reports were not able to be made available publicly through the sec or a system operated by the occ comparable to that of the sec 

the bank has been permitted and currently makes its exchange act filings as a “voluntary filer” with the sec however there can be no assurance that the occ or sec will continue to allow the bank to make filings as a voluntary filer or that the occ will develop a comparable system for making exchange act filings publicly available if the bank’s exchange act filings ceased to be as readily available as those of bank holding companies investors could view the bank less favorably 

the bank’s ability to issue securities in an optimal manner may be adversely affected by the fact that the occ’s securities offering regulations and organizational structure are less well developed than those of the sec which applied to the bank’s holding company prior to the restructuring 

the sec maintains a welldeveloped regulatory regime and wellstaffed organization relating to securities offerings under or exempt from the securities act for example the sec has developed integrated disclosure rules which allow exchange act filings to be incorporated by reference into prospectuses distributed as required by the securities act in addition under the sec’s rules seasoned issuers who are timely in their filings are permitted to use “automatic shelf registration” allowing them to offer securities under a registration statement that is automatically effective upon filing the occ maintains its own securities offering regime applicable to national banks and their securities offerings with which the bank will need to comply in order to access the public capital markets similar to the sec’s offering rules the occ’s regime requires that registration statements be reviewed and declared or become effective however given that there are currently no other nationallycharted banks whose common stock has been issued under the occ’s securities offering regime it is unknown at this point whether and how the occ staff would review registration statements its also unclear whether the occ would apply the same mechanics for automatic shelf registration filings used by secfilers or how more generally the occ will function as a securities regulator given the extent to and manner in which the bank has accessed capital markets historically or to which it currently contemplates accessing such markets the bank does not believe there will be a material adverse impact on the bank’s ability to access capital markets effectively although there can be no assurance that this will be the case it is possible that operating under the occ’s securities offering regime could 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

impede the bank’s ability to sell securities at the most advantageous times or to achieve optimum pricing in offerings 

the bank is subject to restrictions on permissible activities that would limit the types of business it may conduct and that may make acquisitions of other financial companies more challenging 

under applicable laws and regulations bank holding companies and banks are generally limited to business activities and investments that are related to banking or are financial in nature the range of permissible financial activities is set forth in the grammleachbliley act and is more limited for banks than for bank holding company organizations the differences relate mainly to insurance underwriting but not insurance agency activities and merchant banking but not brokerdealer and investment advisory activities loss of the bank holding company status as a result of the restructuring could make future acquisitions of financial institutions with such operations more challenging 

the bank’s common stock is not an insured deposit 

shares of the bank’s common stock are not a bank deposit and therefore losses in value are not insured by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in shares of the bank’s common stock is inherently risky and is subject to the same market forces and investment risks that affect the price of common stock in any other company including the possible loss of some or all principal invested 

reputational risk 

the bank is presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational regulatorycompliance and legal risks 

a reputational risk council was established to monitor manage and develop strategies to effectively manage reputational risk which includes but is not limited to addressing communication logistics legal and regulatory issues

results of operations 

executive summary 





in addition to the metrics shown above the bank’s net interest margin “nim” decreased 7 basis points “bps” for the full year of 2019 versus 2018 which was largely attributable to the low interest rate environment see “interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and net interest margin” for more information on the nim 

asset quality remained relatively stable in 2019 total criticized and classified loans increased 217 million or 19 and 105 million or 15 respectively from historically low levels in 2018 while nonaccrual loans decreased 9 million or 4 during this same period net loan and lease chargeoffs expressed as a percentage of average loans held for investment was 008 in 2019 compared with net recoveries of 004 in 2018 

specifically the financial performance of 2019 relative to 2018 reflects 

• moderate net interest income growth resulting from loan growth 

• a reduction in the overnight federal funds rate by 75 bps which resulted in net interest margin compression 

• modest noninterest income growth due to continued focus on this source of revenue we experienced notable successes such as generating strong growth in capital markets and foreign exchange fees related to arranging interest rate hedges for our loan customers loan syndication arrangement fees and foreign exchange fees wealth management and trust fees increased as a result of increased corporate and personal trust revenue 

• excluding the severance and restructuring charges of 37 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 a slight increase in noninterest expense while we remain focused on expense controls and continue to invest in technology and simplification initiatives we delivered on our commitment to limit adjusted noninterest expense growth in 2019 to only a slight increase relative to our 2018 results adjusted noninterest expense increased 32 million or 2 to 17 billion in 2019 

• an increase in the provision for credit losses to 39 million in 2019 from 40 million in 2018 the 2019 provision increased due to loan growth stabilizing credit quality and increased net chargeoffs mainly due to a few larger isolated chargeoffs during 2018 strong improvements in credit quality and net recoveries resulted in a negative provision 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

• average deposit growth of 19 billion or 4 was very strong during the second half of 2019 which accounted for over 90 of the annual growth 

although net earnings applicable to common shareholders decreased by 8 over the prior year earnings per diluted share increased by 2 due to the repurchase of 11 billion or 235 million shares of bank common stock during 2019 

areas experiencing challenges in 2019 

while 2017 and 2018 experienced increases in shortterm interest rates 2019 experienced a declining interest rate environment the relatively flat yield curve and low interest rate environment put pressure on our nim for the last several years we have been focused on achieving positive operating leverage and improving our profitability however in a period of falling interest rates our ability to achieve these objectives becomes more difficult 

although loan growth was generally consistent with the targeted levels we had established for 2019 we continued to experience a high level of competition during the year some of this competition came from nonbank financial institutions such as debt funds debt capital markets and covenantlight structures 

average loan growth of 28 billion or 6 exceeded average deposit growth of 19 billion or 4 consequently on an average basis throughout 2019 we relied more on wholesale funding to finance incremental balance sheet growth increasing our funding cost 

noninterest income from customerrelated fees increased 3 in 2019 compared with 2018 while we experienced strength in capital markets and foreign exchange fees and wealth management and trust fees our other customerrelated fees declined or were relatively flat 

focus for 2020 

in 2020 we are focused on the ongoing initiatives related to bank profitability and returns on and ofequity major areas of emphasis include the following 

• manage our interest rate risk profile to move toward a more neutral interestrate sensitive position and to protect net income against further declines in interest rates 

• achieve broadbased loan growth ie a low to midsingle digit growth rate within acceptable concentration limits 

• achieve similar or improve upon growth rates in noninterest income emphasizing customerrelated fee income 

• maintain adjusted noninterest expense at 2019 levels or lower while continuing to invest in enabling technologies which will help ensure longterm success in an increasingly competitive marketplace 

• manage noninterest expense growth linked to revenue growth profitability and digital delivery strategies 

• implement technology upgrades and digital strategies to enhance automation and simplification of front middle and back office processes and 

• maintain top quartile credit risk profile and superior risk management posture leading to increasing returns of capital

key drivers of performance 



1 includes loans held for sale 

net interest income 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities and is more than threequarters of our revenue net interest income is derived from both the volume of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and their respective yieldsrates 

net interest income was 23 billion during 2019 an improvement of 42 million or 2 compared with 22 billion during 2018 for both 2019 and 2018 taxableequivalent net interest income was 23 billion compared with 21 billion in 2017 the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 21 for both 2019 and 2018 and 35 for 2017 the slight increase in net interest income is due to loan growth noninterestbearing deposit stability and disciplined deposit pricing partially offset by decreases in benchmark interest rates we are not assuming any further changes in benchmark rates in our forecasts however because of lower overnight benchmark federal funds rates which decreased several times during 2019 partially offset by loan growth and the benefit of our noninterestbearing deposits we expect net interest income to decrease at a moderate pace in 2020 when compared with 2019 if current conditions persist 

schedule 5 

interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and net interest margin 



the nim was 354 and 361 for 2019 and 2018 respectively when comparing 2019 with 2018 higher interest rates and a greater concentration of loans in the earning asset mix led to an increase in earning asset yield which was more than offset by an increase in deposit rates and a modestly greater reliance on highercost borrowed funds 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

funding loan growth with wholesale borrowings negatively impacted the nim relative to deposit funding although it was accretive to net interest income 

noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts are a significant benefit to nim the net impact of noninterestbearing sources of funds on the nim increased to 046 in 2019 compared with 033 in 2018 

average interestearning assets increased 25 billion from 2018 with average rates improving 16 bps average interestbearing liabilities increased 32 billion while average rates increased 36 bps over the same period 

  

our average lending portfolio increased 28 billion to 483 billion an increase of 6 the average balance of our investment securities portfolio decreased 04 billion while the yearend balance decreased 11 billion the loan growth was funded through a mix of deposits securities runoff and wholesale borrowings 

interest expense increased 160 million compared with 2018 results attributable to both an increase in the cost and quantity of deposits and wholesale funding interest expense on deposits increased 119 million on 317 billion of average interestbearing deposits 

average loans increased 28 billion due to widespread growth in essentially all loans categories with average commercial loans accounting for over half of the growth yields on average balances increased by 7 bps 16 bps and 18 bps in the commercial cre and consumer portfolios respectively the commercial loan growth was in municipal commercial and industrial and owneroccupied loans where our yields are generally lower than commercial real estate cre but higher than consumer the federal funds target rate decreased three times in 2019 after increasing four times in 2018 a portion of our variablerate loans were not affected by these changes primarily due to longer reset frequency or because a substantial portion of our variablerate interestearning assets are tied to longerterm rate indices which rates were impacted by a relatively flat yield curve for much of 2018 and 2019 also our earning assets generally reprice more quickly than our funding sources we expect moderate loan growth during 2020 which may not be as strong as we experienced in 2019 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided us with lowcost funding and comprised 42 of average total deposits which totaled 551 billion in 2019 compared with 45 of average total deposits which totaled 532 billion for 2018 average interestbearing deposits increased 8 in 2019 compared with 2018 during 2019 the federal reserve decreased the overnight benchmark federal funds rate by 75 bps while the rate paid on the bank’s interestbearing deposits increased 34 bps 

we are actively monitoring and managing deposits and have been reducing deposit rates since mid2019 as benchmark federal funds interest rates have decreased our cost of total deposits during 2019 increased 21 bps relative to 2018 and we expect the cost of deposits to decline in 2020 due to ongoing efforts to better align deposit costs with lower market rates assuming no further benchmark interest rate increases 

although we consider a wide variety of sources when determining our funding needs we benefit from access to deposits from a significant number of small to midsized business customers which provide us with a low cost of funds and have a positive impact on our nim including wholesale borrowings the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased 36 bps 

the average balance of longterm debt increased 701 million compared with 2018 while the average rate decreased 152 bps during 2019 the bank issued 500 million of senior notes with an interest rate of 335 and 500 million of subordinated notes with an interest rate of 325 overall interest expense on longterm debt increased 18 million the bank has used shortterm federal home loan bank “fhlb” borrowings to fund some of its balance sheet growth during the past couple of years average shortterm debt grew 02 billion and the rate paid increased 43 bps further changes in shortterm borrowings will be primarily driven by loan growth deposit growth and the level of long term debt as we do not expect significant decreases in investment security balances 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 308 in 2019 and 328 in 2018 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim interest rate spreads and margin are impacted by the mix of assets we hold the composition of our loan and securities portfolios and the type of funding used 

our estimates of the bank’s interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate and market

net interest margin and interest rate spreads in 2018 vs 2017 



the nim was 361 and 345 for 2018 and 2017 respectively when comparing 2018 with 2017 changes in asset mix resulted in higher average loans lower average securities and money market investments and higher average interestbearing deposits and wholesale borrowings balances to fund overall balance sheet growth the expansion of nim reflected a higher loan yield with only a moderate increase in funding costs average interestearning assets increased 16 billion from 2017 with average rates improving 36 bps average interestbearing liabilities increased 15 billion and average rates increased 35 bps over the same period 

  

our average lending portfolio increased 19 billion to 454 billion an increase of 4 the average balance of our investment securities portfolio decreased 01 billion while yearend balances decreased 05 billion the net earning asset growth was funded through a mix of deposits and wholesale borrowings 

interest expense increased 124 million compared to 2017 results mainly due to both an increase in the cost and quantity of deposits and wholesale funding interest expense on deposits increased 76 million on 294 billion of average interestbearing deposits 

the increase in the average loan portfolio was due to growth in 14 family residential commercial and industrial and municipal lending yields on average balances increased by 43 bps 45 bps and 20 bps in the commercial cre 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

and consumer portfolios respectively much of the consumer growth was in consumer 14 family residential where our yields are generally lower than on commercial loans 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits comprised 45 of average total deposits which totaled 532 billion in 2018 compared with 46 of average total deposits which totaled 522 billion for 2017 average interestbearing deposits increased 3 in 2018 compared with 2017 during 2018 the federal reserve increased the overnight benchmark federal funds rate by 100 bps while the rate paid on the bank’s interestbearing deposits increased 25 bps implying a deposit beta of 25 including wholesale borrowings the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased 35 bps 

the average balance of longterm debt increased 118 million compared with 2017 while the average rate decreased 58 bps during 2018 the bank issued 500 million of senior notes with an interest rate of 35 overall interest expense on longterm debt increased 4 million average shortterm debt grew 466 million and the rate paid increased 88 bps 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 328 in 2018 and 327 in 2017 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim refer to the “liquidity risk management” section beginning on page 69 for more information on how we manage liquidity risk

provision for credit losses 

schedule 9 

total allowance and provision for credit losses 



the allowance for credit losses acl is the combination of both the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments rulc the alll represents the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date the rulc represents the estimated reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments changes in the alll and rulc including changes in net chargeoffs are recorded in the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the income statement respectively 

the acl increased 2 million to 554 million at december 31 2019 compared with 552 million at december 31 2018 the slight increase in the acl from the prior year period is primarily due to loan growth partially offset by recent default and loss rates that are lower than longterm averages 

the provision for credit losses which is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments was 39 million in 2019 compared with 40 million in 2018 the provision for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations fundings and changes in credit quality 

see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 54 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

on january 1 2020 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” 201613 credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and its subsequent updates often referred to as the current expected credit loss cecl model upon adoption of the asu zions recorded the full amount of the acl for loans and leases of 526 million compared with 554 million at december 31 2019 resulting in an aftertax increase to retained earnings of 20 million the impact of the adoption of cecl for our securities portfolio was less than 1 million as a result of this new accounting standard we expect our allowance for credit losses will become more volatile primarily because under the new process the allowance is subject to economic forecasts that may change materially from period to period for more information see critical accounting policies and significant estimates on page 75 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield growing noninterest income is a key strategic priority and several strategic initiatives are underway to support this effort specifically we are working to leverage our focus on commercial and small business customers to accelerate sales of capital markets products and wealth advisory services noninterest income accounted for 20 of net revenue during both 2019 and 2018 for 2019 noninterest income was 562 million compared with 552 million in 2018 and 544 million in 2017 during 2019 we experienced strong growth in capital markets and

foreign exchange fees driven by income from customer interest rate swap activity loan syndication arrangement fees and foreign exchange fees followed by growth in our wealth management and trust fees while experiencing declines in commercial account fees 

we believe a subtotal of customerrelated fees provides a better view of income over which we have more direct nearterm control it excludes items such as dividends insurancerelated income marktomarket adjustments on certain derivatives and securities gains and losses 

schedule 10 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

schedule 10 

noninterest income 



customerrelated fees increased by 17 million or 3 from 2018 to 2019 capital markets and foreign exchange fees increased by 20 million as a result of an 11 million increase in income from arranging interest rate hedges for our loan customers a 4 million increase in loan syndication arrangement fees and a 3 million increase in foreign exchange fees wealth management and trust fees increased by 5 million or 9 as a result of increased corporate and personal trust revenue other customerrelated fees decreased by 6 million or 22 primarily as a result of the sale of a minor business in the first quarter of 2019 

dividends and other income decreased by 9 million primarily due to valuation adjustments on clientrelated interest rate swaps during 2019 as a result of the decline in interest rates during 2019 and increased client activity during the year these clientrelated interest rate swaps significantly increased in value resulting in the bank having a larger exposure to the clients and a 9 million valuation adjustment in 2019 compared with a valuation adjustment of 1 million in 2018 dividends and other income also decreased during 2019 due to a 3 million gain on venture capital investments in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 and a 3 million decrease in dividends from the federal reserve resulting from a decline in our federal reserve stock held and a decline in the 10year treasury partially offset by a 3 million increase in other miscellaneous income 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense increased by 63 million or 4 from 2018 to 2019 adjusted noninterest expense increased by 32 million or 2 over the same period this 2 increase is within our previously communicated growth rate of low singledigit percentage range relative to the prior year see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 27 for more information regarding the calculation of adjusted noninterest expense 

we have developed a culture that continually seeks to streamline and make more simple and efficient processes required to operate the bank as part of our focus on noninterest expenses in october 2019 we announced a 5 workforce reduction that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019 we also announced the closure of multiple branches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 including 12 branches scheduled to close during 2020 as a result of this reduction in staffing we recognized 22 million of severance and 15 million of other restructuringrelated costs 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

primarily related to centralizing our office space in utah and the closure of certain branches across our footprint in 2018 we successfully completed the merger of the holding company with and into the bank subsidiary the consolidation of the holding company into the bank reduced duplicative regulatory examinations and certain regulatory requirements we remain focused on expense control efforts while continuing to invest in technology initiatives 

schedule 11 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years

schedule 12 

salaries and employee benefits 



salaries and employee benefits increased by 71 million or 7 in 2019 compared with 2018 salaries and employee benefits increased due to a 33 million increase in base salaries resulting from salary merit increases a 22 million increase in severance expenses primarily from the previously announced reduction in staffing levels a 6 million increase in employee medical costs and a 4 million increase in retirement expenses these increases were partially offset by a 7 million decrease in incentive compensation 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 64 million or 6 in 2018 compared with 2017 salaries and employee benefits increased in 2018 primarily due to a 29 million increase in base salaries resulting from salary increases related to the tax cuts and jobs act merit increases and increased headcount and a 19 million increase in incentive compensation of which 7 million relates to the tax cuts and jobs act the remaining 16 million increase was primarily a result of an 8 million increase in the bank’s medical plans and a 7 million increase in the bank’s contribution to the employee 401k plan as a result of improved financial performance 

furniture and equipment expense increased 9 million or 7 in 2019 primarily from increased amortization expense related to capitalized technology costs from the successful implementation of our commercial and 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

consumer loan systems furniture and equipment expense decreased by 4 million in 2018 primarily due to decreased software maintenance expense partially offset by increased amortization of capitalized software 

professional and legal services decreased 5 million from 2018 to 47 million in 2019 the decrease was primarily a result of lower consulting fees related to our simplification and technology initiatives the 5 million decrease in 2018 from 2017 was for the same reason 

advertising expense decreased by 7 million to 19 million for 2019 this decrease was mainly due to lower sponsorships advertising expense in 2018 was 4 million higher compared with 2017 primarily due to increased media expense 

fdic premiums were 25 million in 2019 compared with 50 million in 2018 this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of the fdic surcharge for large banks because the required deposit insurance fund reserve ratio had been met and the bank issuing unsecured debt which results in lower fdic premiums 

other noninterest expense increased 28 million to 225 million in 2019 compared with 197 million in 2018 this increase was due to a 13 million impairment related to centralizing our office space in utah and the closure of certain branches across our footprint and 10 million of customer reimbursements made by the bank to remedy a selfidentified operational issue other noninterest expense decreased 34 million from 2017 to 2018 as a result of a onetime 12 million charitable contribution made at the end of 2017 and a decrease in employee and operational expenses resulting from the bank’s simplification and efficiencies initiatives 

in october 2018 we announced the termination of the defined benefit pension plan subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approval completion of this termination is expected in 2020 plan participant benefits will choose to receive an annuity or a lumpsum payment the elimination of the plan is expected to result in a onetime charge of approximately 10 million to 15 million likely toward the middle of 2020 in addition to the reclassification of an approximate 17 million loss out of aoci into earnings the current estimate of this expense is subject to change depending upon a number of factors including plan performance participant elections between lumpsum distribution options and an annuity option and market competitiveness in the annuity bid process 

branch closing costs and other efficiencyrelated cost accelerations will be recognized in the next several quarters excluding the severance branch closing and other efficiencyrelated cost acceleration expenses adjusted noninterest expense for 2019 experienced a 2 increase relative to the prior year we expect 2020 expenses to be the same as or slightly reduced from 2019 results excluding the expected pension termination expense severance and other restructuring expenses 

income taxes 

income tax expense was 237 million in 2019 259 million in 2018 and 344 million in 2017 our effective income tax rates were 225 in 2019 227 in 2018 and 368 in 2017 the income tax rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance boli the income tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were positively impacted by the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate to 21 from 35 due to the tax cuts and jobs act which was effective january 1 2018 this rate benefit was partially reduced by the nondeductibility of fdic premiums certain executive compensation and other fringe benefits as enacted by the new tax law 

the tax rate for 2017 was impacted by a onetime 18 million benefit to tax expense related to the reevaluation of state tax positions an excess tax benefit of 9 million from the implementation of a new accounting guidance related to sharebased compensation and a net dta writeoff of 47 million through income tax expense associated with the decrease in the federal income tax rate from the passage of new legislation

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases 

schedule 7 which we referenced in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of our interestearning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another goal is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets as a result of this goal we redeployed funds from loweryielding money market investments in addition to using wholesale borrowings to purchase agency securities 

average interestearning assets were 649 billion in 2019 compared with 624 billion in the previous year average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 93 and 94 in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

average loans were 483 billion in 2019 and 454 billion in 2018 average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 69 in 2019 compared with 68 in 2018

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

as of december 31 2019 net loans and leases were 49 billion reflecting a 4 increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations

see notes 12 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity risk management” on page 69 for additional information on funding and borrowed funds 

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the bank’s operations management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance the board of directors has appointed a risk oversight committee “roc” that consists of appointed board members who oversee the bank’s risk management processes the roc meets on a regular basis to monitor and review enterprise risk management “erm” policies and activities as required by its charter the roc performs oversight for various erm activities and approves erm policies and activities as detailed in the roc charter 

management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which the bank’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks these risks are overseen by the various management committees of which the enterprise risk management committee is the focal point for the monitoring and review of enterprise risk 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

the board of directors through the roc is responsible for approving the overall credit policies relating to the management of the credit risk of the bank in addition the roc oversees and monitors adherence to key credit policies and the credit risk appetite as defined in the risk appetite framework additionally the board has established the credit risk committee chaired by the chief credit officer and consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk for the bank and approving changes to the bank’s credit policies 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit risk management and credit examination functions our credit policies place emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses these formal credit policies and procedures provide the bank with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level credit examinations related to the acl are reported to both the audit committee and the roc 

our credit risk management function is separate from the lending function and strengthens control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities in addition we have a welldefined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio and we utilize a comprehensive loan riskgrading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore the internal credit examination department which is independent of the lending function periodically conducts examinations of the bank’s lending departments and credit activities these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan riskgrading administration and compliance with credit policies new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the new initiative review committee 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio we attempt to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular industry or collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty generally our loan portfolio is well diversified however due to the nature of our geographical footprint there are certain significant concentrations primarily in cre and oil and gasrelated lending we have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on leveraged lending municipal lending oil and gasrelated lending and various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographical footprint of our banking affiliates 

as we continue to monitor our concentration risk the composition of our loan portfolio remained relatively unchanged from the prior year total commercial loans remained at 52 of the total portfolio at december 31 2019 and 2018 cre loans remained at 24 of the total portfolio at december 31 2019 and 2018 consumer loans also remained at 24 of the total loan portfolio at december 31 2019 and 2018

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

approximately 9 of the cre term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2019 for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to five years the remaining 91 of cre loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project loantovalue ratio and occupancy rates 

approximately 158 million or 7 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2019 consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects 

underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily and hospitality construction projects we require substantial preleasingleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan significant consideration is given to the forecasted market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower generally by our internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed a new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness 

advance rates ie loan commitments will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and homes not under contract and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement 

the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing cre loans for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes this repayment source into consideration 

when we modify or extend a loan we also give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether we have granted a concession in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists however if additional collateral is obtained or if a guarantor exists who has the 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

capacity and willingness to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared with the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

consumer loans 

we have mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality we generally hold variablerate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixedrate loans to third parties including federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards 

we are engaged in home equity credit line “hecl” lending at both december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 our hecl portfolio totaled 29 billion the following schedule describes the composition of our hecl portfolio by lien status 

schedule 24 

hecl portfolio by lien status 



at december 31 2019 loans representing less than 1 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateralvalue at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination 

approximately 89 of our hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 18 of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years we regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates the analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment the ratio of net chargeoffs to average

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2019 decreased to 243 million from 252 million at december 31 2018 primarily in the term cre loan portfolio the largest total decrease in nonaccrual loans occurred at amegy 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on nonaccrual loans

restructured loans 

troubled debt restructurings “tdrs” are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties and for whom we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider tdrs decreased 49 million or 24 during 2019 primarily due to payments and payoffs commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such consumer loan tdrs may include residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

if a nonaccruing restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether a loan should be returned to accrual status

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other ratesensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixedincome securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the bank’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the bank including interest rate and market risk management the board has established the asset liability committee “alco” consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the bank alco establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews with the roc the limits and limit exceptions reported by management 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to manage balance sheet sensitivity to reduce net income volatility due to changes in interest rates 

over the course of the last several years we have actively reduced the level of asset sensitivity through the purchase of shorttomedium duration agency passthrough securities and funding these purchases by reducing money market investments and increasing shortterm borrowings this repositioning of the investment portfolio has increased current net interest income while dampening the impact of lower rates on net interest income contraction we anticipate moderately lower net interest income in a falling rate environment as our assets reprice more quickly than our liabilities 

additionally during 2019 weve expanded our use of interest rate derivatives to further reduce asset sensitivity through purchased interest rate floors which were subsequently rolled into receivefixed interest rate swaps and additional receivefixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of pools of floatingrate loans we also use receivefixed interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of fixedrate debt to further manage our interest rate risk profile for more information on derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow and fair value hedges see note 7 – derivative instruments and hedging activities  

the schedule below presents all derivatives utilized in our asset liability management alm activities that are designated in qualifying hedging relationships as defined by gaap as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 the schedule includes the notional amount fair value and the weightedaverage strike rate for each category of interest rate derivatives shown by maturity for the next five years

interest rate risk measurement 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods net interest income simulation or earnings at risk “ear” and economic value of equity at risk “eve” ear analyzes the expected change in near term one year net interest income in response to changes in interest rates in the eve method we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates 

ear is an estimate of the change in total net interest income that would be recognized under different interest rate environments over a oneyear period this simulated impact to net interest income due to a change in rates uses as its base a modeled net interest income that is not necessarily the same as the most recent quarters or years reported 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

net interest income rather ear employs estimated net interest income under an unchanged interest rate scenario as the basis for comparison the ear process then simulates changes to the base net interest income under several interest rate scenarios including parallel and nonparallel interest rate shifts across the yield curve taking into account deposit repricing assumptions and estimates of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio eg a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lowerrate environment the ear model does not contemplate changes in fee income that are amortized into interest income eg premiums discounts origination points and costs etc our policy contains a trigger for a 10 decline in ratesensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps as of december 31 2018 the ear declined by 12 for a 200 bps decline in rates this trigger violation informed our decision to move to a less assetsensitive position throughout 2019 as of december 31 2019 the ear declined by 9 for a 200 bps decline in rates 

eve is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities we measure changes in the dollar amount of eve for parallel shifts in interest rates due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in eve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney interest rate caps or limits on loans which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for lowrate mortgages in a higherrate environment our policy contains a trigger for an 8 decline in eve as well as a risk capacity of a 10 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps exceptions to the eve limits are subject to notification and approval by the roc 

estimating the impact on net interest income and eve requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration eg customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit competitive pricing eg existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates loan and security prepayments and the effects of other similar embedded options as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans we also calculate the sensitivity of ear and eve results to key assumptions as most of our liabilities are comprised of indeterminate maturity and managed rate deposits the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for these deposits such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options we use historical regression analysis as a guide for setting such assumptions however due to the current low interest rate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit behavior may not reflect actual future results additionally competition for funding in the marketplace has and may again result in changes to deposit pricing on interestbearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as libor or the federal funds rate 

under most rising interest rate environments we would expect some customers to move balances from demand deposits to interestbearing accounts such as money market savings or certificates of deposit the models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration 

in addition we assume certain correlation rates often referred to as a “deposit beta” of interestbearing deposits wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared with changes in average benchmark interest rates generally certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate while interestonchecking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate actual results may differ materially due to factors including the shape of the yield curve competitive pricing money supply credit worthiness of the bank and so forth however we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in the following schedule 

schedule 31 

deposit assumptions 



as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows ear or percentage change in net interest income based on a static balance sheet size in the first year after the interest rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

schedule 32 

income simulation – change in net interest income 



1 assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift 

for nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 32 if the weighted average deposit beta were to decline to 28 the ear in the 100bps shock would change from  46 to 51 

for comparative purposes the december 31 2018 measures are presented in the following schedule 



1 assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift 

the asset sensitivity as measured by ear decreased slightly since december 31 2018 due to changes in the investment securities and funding compositions 

the ear analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of rates the yield curve typically does not move in a parallel manner if we consider a steepening rate shock where the shortterm rate moves 200bps but the tenyear rate only moves 30bps the earnings decline is 15 less severe over 12 months compared with the parallel 200bps rate shock 

as of the dates indicated the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in eve under parallel interest rate changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps for nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 32 if the weighted average deposit beta were to decrease to 28 it would change the eve in the 100bps shock from 80 to 79 the decrease in eve in the down rate shock is a result of the fact that in a very low rate environment the discount to par on deposits is floored at zero

schedule 33 

changes in economic value of equity 



1 assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift 



1 assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift 

the changes in eve measures from december 31 2018 are primarily driven by the behavior of the deposit models for nonmaturity deposits the deposit premium or discount below par value is floored at zero in a lowrate environment with term rates significantly lower on december 31 2019 than on december 31 2018 eg 5 year libor swap is approximately 110bps lower deposit premium valuations have approached the floor resulting in minimal downward change in the 100bps rate shock furthermore during 2019 some deposit model parameters were updated which made the premium valuation closer to zero and the negative rate shock less comparable to the december 31 2018 value the positive rate shocks were less impacted by these model updates 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the bank’s assetliability management posture at december 31 2019 21 billion of the bank’s commercial lending and cre loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next three months of these variablerate loans approximately 98 are tied to either the prime rate or libor for these variablerate loans we have executed 36 billion of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps or through purchased interest rate floors additionally asset sensitivity is reduced due to 237 million of variablerate loans being priced at floored rates at december 31 2019 which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 43 bps at december 31 2019 we also had 33 billion of variablerate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next three months of these variablerate consumer loans approximately 65 million were priced at floored rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 17 bps see notes 3 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority regulating libor along with various other regulatory bodies announced that libor would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021 for more information on the transition from libor see risk factors on page 15 we are actively working to address any impacted contracts but realize that amending certain contracts indexed to libor may require consent from the counterparties which could be difficult and costly to obtain in certain limited circumstances interest rate and market risk are managed centrally 

market risk – fixed income 

we engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixedincome securities 

at december 31 2019 we had a relatively small amount 182 million of trading assets and 66 million of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 106 million and 85 million respectively at december 31 2018 

we are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value we are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2019 the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs securities increased by 257 million due largely to changes in the interest rate environment compared with a 114 million decrease in the same prior year period 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

market risk – equity investments 

through our equity investment activities we own equity securities that are publicly traded in addition we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and an fhlb that are not publicly traded the accounting for equity investments may use the cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs we are exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by the bank’s equity investments committee consisting of members of management 

we hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly prepublic companies primarily through various sbic venture capital funds our equity exposure to these investments was approximately 154 million and 132 million at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively on occasion some of the companies within our sbic investments may issue an initial public offering in this case the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment which can introduce additional market risk 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity refers to our capacity to meet our cash and collateral obligations and to manage both expected and unexpected cash flows without adversely impacting the operations or financial strength of the bank sources of liquidity include both traditional forms of funding such as deposits borrowings and equity and unencumbered assets such as marketable loans and securities 

since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds for our customers’ credit needs capital plan actions anticipated financial and contractual obligations which include withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardapproved corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines such as a 30day liquidity coverage ratio that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the bank as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the bank the bank continues to perform liquidity stress tests and assess its portfolio of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under stress scenarios at december 31 2019 our investment securities portfolio of 14 billion and cash and money market investments of 2 billion collectively comprised 24 of total assets 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed by the treasury department under the direction of the corporate treasurer with oversight by alco the treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the bank’s liquidity policy these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policy also must be approved by the bank’s ermc and the board of directors the bank has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk the policy requires the bank to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows in the event of a severe liquidity crisis throughout 2019 and as of december 31 2019 the bank complied with this policy 

liquidity regulation 

upon passage of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the bank is no longer subject to the enhanced prudential standards for liquidity management reg yy however the bank continues to perform liquidity stress tests and assess its portfolio of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under the stress scenarios although the bank is no longer subject to the regulations of the final lcr rule it exceeds the regulatory requirements that mandates a buffer of securities and other liquid assets to cover 70 of 30day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated therein 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

liquidity management actions 

the bank’s consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements were 18 billion at december 31 2019 compared with 24 billion at december 31 2018 a decrease of 06 billion during 2019 the uses of cash were primarily from 1 a net decrease in shortterm borrowings 2 net loan originations 3 repurchases of our common stock and 4 dividends on common and preferred stock the sources of cash during this same period were primarily from 1 a net increase in deposits 2 a net decrease in investment securities 3 the issuance of longterm debt and 4 net cash provided by operating activities 

the bank’s core deposits consisting of noninterestbearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits and time deposits under 250000 were 548 billion at december 31 2019 compared with 512 billion at december 31 2018 total deposits were 571 billion at december 31 2019 compared with 541 billion at december 31 2018 the 30 billion increase during 2019 was primarily a result of a 26 billion and 04 billion increase in savings and money market deposits and time deposits respectively 

during 2019 the bank issued 500 million of senior notes with an interest rate of 335 and a maturity date of march 4 2022 and 500 million of subordinated notes with an interest rate of 325 and a maturity date of october 29 2029 the bank subsequently entered into receivefixed interest rate swaps for the notes the notes and swaps constitute qualifying fair value hedging relationships for more information on derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow and fair value hedges see note 7 – derivative instruments and hedging activities  at december 31 2019 maturities of our longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from august 2021 to october 2029 

the bank’s cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses increased to 401 million during 2019 from 237 million during 2018 primarily due to an increase in deposits and longterm debt and an increase in the rate paid on borrowed funds additionally the bank paid approximately 260 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock during 2019 compared with 236 million during 2018 dividends paid per common share have increased gradually from 020 in the first quarter of 2018 to 034 in the fourth quarter of 2019 in february 2020 the board approved a quarterly common dividend of 034 per share 

general financial market and economic conditions impact our access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets for the bank is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings all of the credit rating agencies rate the bank’s debt at an investmentgrade level the bank’s credit ratings improved slightly during 2019 and are presented in the following schedule 

schedule 34 

credit ratings 



the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and a significant source of funding zions bancorporation na is a member of the fhlb of des moines the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements the bank is required to invest in fhlb and federal reserve stock to maintain their borrowing capacity 

at december 31 2019 the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 153 billion compared with 138 billion at december 31 2018 loans with a carrying value of approximately 215 billion at december 31 2019 have been pledged at the fhlb of des moines and the federal reserve as collateral for current and potential borrowings compared with 226 million at december 31 2018 at 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

december 31 2019 we had 10 billion of shortterm fhlb borrowings outstanding and no longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding compared with 45 billion of shortterm fhlb borrowings and no longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding at december 31 2018 at december 31 2019 our total investment in fhlb and federal reserve stock was 50 million and 107 million respectively compared with 190 million and 139 million at december 31 2018 

our afs investment securities are primarily held as a source of contingent liquidity we target securities that can be easily turned into cash through sale or repurchase agreements and whose value remains relatively stable during market disruptions we regularly manage our shortterm funding needs through secured borrowing with the securities pledged as collateral interest rate risk management is another consideration for selection of investment securities our afs securities balances decreased by 10 billion during 2019 

the bank’s loan to total deposit ratio has remained consistent and was 85 at december 31 2019 compared with 86 at december 31 2018 indicating higher deposit growth than loan growth during 2019 in recent years loan growth has generally outpaced deposit growth if our operating and investing activities including deposit activity do not provide the loan funding required the bank will rely on more expensive wholesale funding for a portion of its loan growth our use of average borrowed funds both short and longterm increased by 858 million during 2019 as our average deposit growth decrease in afs securities and operating activities only partially funded loan growth over the period during 2019 we paid income taxes of 233 million compared with 207 million during 2018 

we may also from time to time issue additional preferred stock senior or subordinated notes or other forms of capital or debt instruments depending on our capital funding assetliability management or other needs as market conditions warrant and subject to any required regulatory approvals management believes that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably foreseeable shortterm and intermediateterm demands 

contractual obligations 

schedule 35 summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2019 

schedule 35 

contractual obligations 



1 indeterminable maturity deposits include noninterestbearing demand savings and money market 

2 commitments to make venture and other noninterestbearing investments do not have defined maturity dates they are due upon demand and may be drawn immediately or as late as after five years therefore these commitments are shown as having indeterminable maturities 

3 the maturities on longterm debt do not include the associated hedges 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 35 we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business some of these contracts are renewable or cancellable at least annually and in certain cases to secure favorable pricing concessions we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

we also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

operational risk management 

operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events in our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk we have an erm department whose responsibility is to help employees management and the board of directors to assess understand measure manage and monitor risk in accordance with our risk appetite framework we have documented both controls and the control selfassessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and the fdicia 

to manage and minimize our operational risk we have in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate our systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to those systems to our legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the bank’s compliance risk management internal audit and credit examination departments reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data in addition the data governance department has key governance surrounding data integrity and availability oversight further we have key programs and procedures to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters we also mitigate certain operational risks through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

we are continually improving our oversight of operational risk including enhancement of risk identification risk and control selfassessments and antifraud measures which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees the operational risk management committee reports to the ermc which reports to the roc key measures have been established in line with our risk management framework to increase oversight by erm and operational risk management through the strengthening of new initiative reviews and enhancements to the enterprise procurement and third party risk management we also continue to enhance and strengthen the business continuity and disaster recovery programs enterprise security programs fraud risk oversight incident response oversight and technology reporting 

significant enhancements have also been made to governance technology and reporting including the establishment of policy and committee governance programs the implementation of a governance risk and control solution and the creation of an enterprise risk profile and operational risk profile in addition the establishment of an enterprise examination management department has standardized our response and reporting and increased our effectiveness and efficiencies with regulatory examination communications and issues management 

the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our systems sometimes referred to as hacking cyber fraud cyberattacks or other similar names continues to grow to combat the ever increasing sophistication of cyberattacks we have upgraded key detection software and expanded the number of staff and expertise to monitor and manage cyberattacks in addition we have elevated our oversight internal reporting to the board and respective 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

committees we have also implemented an advisory group made up of cyber industry and academic experts to assist us in better managing this critical risk 

capital management 

overview 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” chaired by the chief financial officer and consisting of members of management whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the bank other major cmc responsibilities include 

• setting overall capital targets within the boardapproved capital policy monitoring performance compared with the bank’s capital policy limits and recommending changes to capital including dividends common stock issuances and repurchases subordinated debt and changes in major strategies to maintain the bank at wellcapitalized levels 

• maintaining an adequate capital cushion to withstand adverse stress events while continuing to meet the borrowing needs of its customers and to provide reasonable assurance of continued access to wholesale funding consistent with fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders and 

• reviewing agency ratings of the bank 

the bank has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the bank to 

• maintain sufficient capital to support current needs 

• maintain an adequate capital cushion to withstand future adverse stress events while continuing to meet borrowing needs of its customers and 

• meet fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders while managing capital distributions to shareholders through dividends and repurchases of common stock so as to be consistent with federal reserve guidelines sr 0904 and 12 usc §§ 56 and 60 

merger of bank holding company into bank 

on september 30 2018 the bank completed the merger of zions bancorporation its former bank holding company with and into the bank formerly known as zb na in order to reduce organizational complexity the restructuring eliminated the bank holding company structure and associated regulatory framework and resulted in zb na being renamed zions bancorporation national association and becoming the toplevel entity within our corporate structure the bank’s primary regulator is now the occ the bank continues to be subject to examinations by the cfpb with respect to consumer financial regulations under the national bank act and occ regulations certain capital transactions may be subject to the approval of the occ 

stress testing 

as a result of the financial stability oversight council’s action on september 12 2018 and the merger of the holding company into the bank the bank is no longer considered a systemically important financial institution under the doddfrank act the bank has experienced greater flexibility in the active management of shareholders’ equity the bank continues to utilize stress testing as the primary mechanism to inform its decisions on the appropriate level of capital and capital actions based upon actual and hypotheticallystressed economic conditions the results of our internal stress tests are publicly available on the banks website the timing and amount of capital actions will be subject to various factors including the banks financial performance business needs prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and occ approval 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

common stock and common stock repurchases 

common stock and additional paidin capital decreased 11 billion or 28 from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 primarily due to 11 billion of bank common stock repurchases of 235 million shares from publicly announced plans at an average price of 4680 per share 

the level of common stock repurchases we executed during 2019 will moderate in the near term as we approach our target capital amounts and ratios the bank expects to maintain the appropriate amount of capital to cover inherent risk while distributing excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the timing and amount of additional common share repurchases will be subject to various factors including the banks financial performance business needs prevailing economic conditions and occ approval the magnitude timing and form of capital return will be determined by the board shares may be repurchased occasionally in the open market through privately negotiated transactions utilizing rule 10b51 plans or otherwise in february 2020 the bank announced that the board approved a plan to repurchase 75 million of common stock during the first quarter of 2020 

schedule 36 

capital distributions 



the bank paid common dividends of 226 million or 128 per share during 2019 compared with 202 million or104 per share during 2018 in february 2020 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 034 per common share payable on february 20 2020 to shareholders of record on february 13 2020 we paid dividends on preferred stock of 34 million during both 2019 and 2018 see note 14 for additional detail about capital management transactions during 2019 

total shareholders’ equity decreased slightly and was 74 billion at december 31 2019 compared with 76 billion at december 31 2018 this decrease was primarily a result of 11 billion from repurchases of bank common stock and 260 million from common and preferred dividends paid these decreases were partially offset by net income of 816 million and 293 million from an increase in the fair value of our afs securities due largely to changes in the interest rate environment 

during 2017 through 2019 the market price of our common stock was higher than the exercise price of common stock warrants on our common stock and had a dilutive effect upon earnings per share the exercise of the common stock warrants is cashless as the warrants are settled on a net share basis and will increase average basic shares the impact of the common stock warrants is already considered in the average dilutive shares as of december 31 2019 the bank had 293 million zionw warrants outstanding with an exercise price of 3391 which expire on may 22 2020 during 2018 18 million shares of common stock were issued from the cashless exercise of 58 million zionz common stock warrants which expired on november 14 2018 

the following schedule presents the diluted shares from the remaining common stock warrants at various zions bancorporation na common stock market prices as of december 31 2019 excluding the effect of changes in exercise cost and warrant share multiplier from the future payment of common stock dividends

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the bank’s significant accounting policies discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the bank’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the bank is important to have a complete picture of the 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

bank’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements gaap has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the bank’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than the carrying value of the item being valued considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the bank’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available the bank is required to make judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available the bank uses valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors investment securities in an unrealized loss position are 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of otherthantemporary impairment “otti” otti is considered to have occurred if the instrument’s fair value is below its amortized cost and 1 we intend to sell the security 2 it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis the “more likely than not” criterion is a lower threshold than the “probable” criterion 

notes 1 3  5 7 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the “investment securities portfolio” on page 49 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

allowance for credit losses 

the acl includes the alll and the rulc the alll represents management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses as well as a qualitative review of the results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment and is described in more detail in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the rulc provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the alll plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses as an example if the probability of default risk grade for all passgraded loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal riskgrading scale the quantitatively determined amount of the alll at december 31 2019 would increase by approximately 90 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in risk grades may have on the allowance estimate 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the bank’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the acl we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the acl the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 54 contains further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the acl 

on january 1 2020 we adopted cecl and recorded an acl for loans and leases of 526 million resulting in an aftertax increase to retained earnings of 20 million the impact of the adoption of cecl for our securities portfolio was less than 1 million the acl as calculated under cecl is influenced by the portfolio composition credit quality macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that time as well as other management judgments see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 93 for more information on this guidance and its impact on the bank 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value in the financial statements of a reporting unit at the time of its acquisition and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this test at the beginning of the fourth quarter annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of our reporting units inclusive of goodwill is less than fair value the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount inclusive of goodwill is more likely than not to exceed its fair value additional quantitative analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any of goodwill impairment our reporting units with goodwill are amegy cbt and zions bank 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we historically have used a combination of up to three separate quantitative methods comparable publiclytraded commercial banks in the western and southwestern states 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

“market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of commercial banks in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

• selection of comparable publiclytraded companies based on location size and business focus and composition 

• selection of market comparable acquisition transactions based on location size business focus and composition and date of the transaction 

• the discount rate which is based on the bank’s estimate of its cost of equity capital 

• the projections of future earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit 

• the relative weight given to the valuations derived by the three methods described and 

• the control premium associated with reporting units 

we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the bank is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the bank’s geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium ranging from 0 to 15 for the reporting units was appropriate 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount estimates include economic conditions which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the bank ’ s regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we performed a full quantitative analysis of the reporting units’ fair value as described above our evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 35 54 and 78 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings was increased by 100 bps the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 33 52 and 72 respectively 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation effective october 1 2019 the bank elected to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if the quantitative analysis performed in prior years as described above was required the bank’s qualitative analysis assessed factors related to each reporting unit to determine if it was more likely than not that the carrying value of any reporting unit was greater than the unit’s fair value the qualitative factors considered in our assessment for each reporting unit included 1 economic industry and market conditions 2 regulatory or political developments that could negatively impact operating costs and overall financial performance of any of our specific reporting units and 3 any changes in management key personnel strategy customers and any new or evolving litigation 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

none of the factors considered in our qualitative assessment gave any indication that the reporting units’ fair values decreased during the 2019 fiscal year additionally as evidenced in the business segment analysis section of the mda each reporting unit’s key performance metrics remained materially unchanged or improved in 2019 compared with 2017 considering the improved performance of each reporting unit and the lack of any significant concerns being identified in our qualitative assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit continues to be greater than its carry amount making further quantitative impairment testing unnecessary as a result none of our reporting units were subject to goodwill impairment during 2019 or were determined to be at risk for a potential goodwill impairment in the near future based on information known at this time

supervision and regulation 

this section describes the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the bank the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable laws or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the bank 

on september 30 2018 we completed the merger of zions bancorporation the bank’s former holding company with and into zions bancorporation na sometimes referred to herein as the “restructuring” more information about the restructuring and its effects can be found in the proxy statement filed by zions bancorporation with the sec on july 24 2018 in connection with completing the restructuring we also received approval of an application filed with the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” seeking a determination that the bank is not “systemically important” as defined by provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” as a result of the restructuring and fsoc approval 

 the banking and financial services business in which we engage is and remains highly regulated such regulation is intended among other things to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers including both loan customers and depositors and taxpayers these regulations are not however generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors and in fact may have the consequence of reducing returns to our shareholders banking laws and regulations promulgated thereunder have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry which have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders 

legislative changes to laws governing the financial industry occur frequently some of this legislation materially affects the manner in which we and other financial institutions operate including increasing the costs and other burdens of conducting our businesses in addition the banking agencies regularly promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations which also have significant impact on the financial industry the content and impact of such regulatory changes cannot presently be determined the bank is committed to both satisfying regulatory expectations and providing attractive shareholder returns however given the everevolving regulatory environment the results of these efforts cannot yet be known 

general 

the bank is subject to the provisions of the national bank act and other statutes governing national banks as well as the rules and regulations of the occ the cfpb and the fdic it is also subject to examination and supervision by the occ and examination by the cfpb in respect of federal consumer financial regulations the bank as well as some of its subsidiaries is also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies these regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec financial industry regulatory authority “finra” andor state securities regulators 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the national bank act 

prior to the restructuring zions bancorporation’s corporate affairs were governed by utah state law and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws including the securities act and exchange act as administered by the sec each of these legal regimes is welldeveloped and used widely by public companies 

following the restructuring the bank’s corporate affairs are governed by the national bank act and related regulations administered by the occ with respect to securities matters the bank is not subject to the securities act but is subject to occ regulations governing securities offerings the bank’s common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the exchange act which vests the occ with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the exchange act applicable to banks such as the bank though the bank continues to make filings required by the exchange act with the sec as a voluntary filer these statutory and regulatory regimes are not as well developed as the corporate and securities law regimes applicable to many other publicly held corporations see discussion under “ risk factors ” 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act and related regulations broadly affect the financial services industry among other things the doddfrank act involves mandatory divestiture of certain equity investments increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector 

regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act require many banks to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets than was generally the case prior to the enactment of the doddfrank act and limit the forms of capital that such banks rely upon for regulatory purposes certain bank holding companies and other financial institutions known as systemically important financial institutions or sifis are required to adhere to “enhanced prudential supervision” requirements of the doddfrank act and the annual comprehensive capital analysis “ccar” process administered by the frb which in effect requires sifis to maintain capital based on hypothetical scenarios dictated by the frb as a result of the restructuring and fsoc approval the bank is no longer subject to these requirements including the prior nonobjection requirement under ccar for declaring any dividends or share repurchases or the liquidity and capital requirements applicable to sifis however the bank continues to be subject to the occ’s heightened standard guidelines which establish enhanced requirements for national banks with assets of 50 billion or more and other regulatory requirements that reduce its flexibility to return capital to shareholders and respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions additionally in may 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act also known as “the crapo bill” was signed into law reducing regulatory requirements for many banking institutions and exempting the bank from the capital planning actions as required by the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and the pricing of certain products and services including the following 

 the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining large financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws restricting the scope of federal preemption could burden national banks with the requirement that they also comply with certain state laws covering matters already covered by federal law in addition the doddfrank act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the bank and other companies subject to the doddfrank act are subject to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules these restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act include documentation and governance deferral riskbalancing and clawback requirements any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or engage in other activities or could result in regulatory enforcement actions 

during the second quarter of 2016 the us financial regulators including the frb and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets including the bank the proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion such as the bank and further more stringent requirements for those with total consolidated assets of at least 250 billion the general qualitative requirements include i prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation ii prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss iii establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward iv requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and v mandating appropriate recordkeeping for larger financial institutions including the bank the proposed revised regulations would also introduce very prescriptive requirements relating to the types and percentages the timing of the realization and the risk of forfeiture of incentive compensation awarded to “senior executive officers” and “significant risktakers” the regulators have not yet issued any final rules 

capital standards  basel framework 

in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the basel iii capital rules effectively replaced the basel i capital rules and implemented the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revised the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the bank compared to the basel i us riskbased capital rules the basel iii capital rules became effective for the bank on january 1 2015 and were subject to phasein periods for certain of their components in november 2017 the frb fdic and occ published a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain us basel iii capital rules for nonadvanced approaches banks such as the bank effective january 1 2018 the final rule retains the 2017 basel iii transitional treatment of certain dtas and mortgage servicing assets among others as a result since january 1 2018 our dtas and mortgage servicing assets retained their 2017 risk weight treatment until the federal banking regulators revise the extended transitional treatment under the november 2017 transitional rule 

the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replaced the riskweighting approach derived from basel i capital accords of the basel committee with a more risksensitive approach based in part on the standardized approach in the basel committee’s 2004 basel ii capital accords the basel iii capital rules also implemented the requirements of section 939a of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules 

the basel iii capital rules among other things i introduced a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” ii specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements iii applied most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and iv expanded the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared to prior regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows 



zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

 as of january 1 2019 the basel iii capital rules also require the bank to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effect not reflected in net income 

the basel iii capital rules also prescribed a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expanded the riskweighting categories from basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures to 1250 for certain securitization exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules provided more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increased the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

the basel iii capital rules provided for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights dtas dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 the application of this part of the rule did not result in any deductions from cet1 for us 

under prior basel i capital standards the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” items included in capital were excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios as a “nonadvanced approaches banking organization” we made a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items as allowed under the basel iii capital rules 

basel iii also required additional regulatory capital disclosures to be made that are commonly referred to as “pillar 3” disclosures these disclosures require the bank to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding its capital structure adequacy and riskweighted assets the bank began publishing these pillar 3 disclosures in 2015 and such disclosures are available on the bank’s website 

the basel committee has issued a series of updates that propose other changes to capital regulations in one of these the basel committee finalized a revised framework for calculating minimum capital requirements for market risk which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations the basel committee has set an effective date for reporting under the revised framework for market risk capital of january 1 2022 the us federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these revisions for us banking organizations the bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules as of december 31 2018 

capital planning and stress testing 

as a result of the successful completion of the restructuring and fsoc approval described elsewhere in this report and the enactment of the crapo bill the bank is no longer required to participate in the frb’s ccar process or publicly disclose the results of stress testing or the bank’s proposed capital actions however the bank intends to continue to release the results of its internal stress tests published to its website as stress testing is the bank’s 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

primary method of assessing capital adequacy prior to elimination of this requirement however the bank submitted its 2018 capital plan and stress test results to the frb in its capital plan the bank was required to forecast for nine quarters under a variety of hypothetical economic scenarios its estimated regulatory capital ratios and its generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” tangible common equity ratio on june 21 2018 we filed a form 8k with the sec presenting the results of the bank’s 2018 doddfrank act stress tests “dfast” the results of the stress test demonstrated that the bank had sufficient capital to withstand a severe hypothetical economic downturn detailed disclosure of the bank’s 2018 dfast results can also be found on our website the bank expects to continue to utilize its internal stress testing as an important mechanism to inform its decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypotheticallystressed economic conditions 

liquidity 

historically regulation and monitoring of bank liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter both in the united states and internationally without required formulaic measures however in january 2016 the frb and other banking regulators adopted final rules “final liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” rule” implementing a us version of the basel committee’s lcr requirement the lcr is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of securities and other liquid assets to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30day stress scenario the final lcr rule applies to large internationally active banking organizations those with at least 250 billion in total assets or at least 10 billion in onbalance sheet foreign exposure and a modified less stringent rule applies to bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that have at least 50 billion in total assets but are not internationally active banking organizations 

following the restructuring the bank is no longer subject to the final lcr rule despite having greater than 50 billion in total assets the bank continues to maintain strong onbalance sheet liquidity and a portfolio of liquid assets comparable to requirements in the rule 

financial privacy and cyber security 

the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addressed five categories of cyber standards 1 cyber risk governance 2 cyber risk management 3 internal dependency management 4 external dependency management and 5 incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness the comment period expired in february 2017 however the regulators have not yet issued any revised proposed rules or final rules 

state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including date encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements in june 2018 the california legislature passed the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” which is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa which covers businesses that obtain or access personal information on california resident consumers grants consumers enhanced privacy rights and 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

control over their personal information and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to consumer data privacy rights we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate other states have implemented or are considering similar privacy laws 

in may 2018 the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data we believe the applicability of the gdpr to us is minimal as we do not offer goods or services to eu residents or monitor their behaviors 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia as modified by the basel iii capital rules an insured depository institution generally will be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its cet1 ratio is under 45 its total riskbased capital ratio is less than 8 its tier 1 riskbased capital ratio is less than 6 or its tier 1 leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator

the bank is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 



zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

 the bank is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information the national association of securities dealers automated quotations “nasdaq” has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the bank has overseen management’s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk practices this system includes policies and guidelines such as corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of bank stock by insiders and charters for the executive audit risk oversight compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the bank’s corporate governance practices is available on the bank’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom the bank’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the bank has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the bank the bank intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the bank cannot be predicted 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the bank are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the bank is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the bank frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 




 item 1a risk factors 

the bank’s growth strategy is driven by key factors while adhering to defined risk parameters the key elements of the bank’s strategy reflect its prudent risktaking philosophy the bank generates revenue by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks these factors are outlined in the bank’s risk appetite framework 

the bank’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee of the board approved an enterprise risk management framework and appointed an enterprise risk management committee “ermc” to oversee and implement the framework the ermc is comprised of senior management of the bank and is chaired by the chief risk officer the bank’s most significant risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in prudent extension of credit to relationship customers in addition to credit risk these committees also monitor the following level one risk areas market and interest rate risk liquidity risk strategic business and corporate governance risk operationaltechnology risk cyber risk model risk capitalfinancial reporting risk legalcompliance risk including regulatory risk and reputational risk as outlined in the bank’s risk taxonomy additional governance and oversight includes boardapproved policies and management committees with direct focus on these specific risk categories incorporated into each of these level one risks mentioned previously is third party vendor risk which the bank views as critical in the management and oversight of vendors 

although not comprehensive the following describes several risk factors that are significant to the bank 

credit risk 

credit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks a decline in the strength of the us economy in general or the local economies in which we conduct operations could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses “alll” 

we have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio including loans secured by real estate leveraged and enterprise value lending and oil and gasrelated lending which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results 

concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the bank concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the bank due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk 

we engage in commercial construction and land acquisition and development lending as well as commercial term lending primarily in our western states footprint the bank as a whole has relatively larger concentrations of such lending than many other peer institutions in addition we have a concentration in oil and gasrelated lending primarily in texas both commercial real estate “cre” and oil and gasrelated lending are subject to specific risks including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateralvalues and activity levels in addition our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states and values there may behave differently than in other parts of the united states we may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the united states 

the bank provides a full range of banking and related services through its local management teams and unique brands in arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah washington and wyoming approximately 79 and 78 of the bank’s total net interest income relates to our banking operations in utah texas and california for the years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively as a result of this geographic concentration our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results for example our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events at december 31 2018  loan balances associated with our banking operations in utah texas and california comprised 79 of the bank’s commercial lending portfolio 73 of the cre lending portfolio and 69 of the consumer lending portfolio 

we have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

adverse economic conditions negatively affect the bank’s assets including its loan and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition the most recent financial crisis resulted in significant regulatory changes that continue to affect the bank although economic conditions have improved since the most recent financial crisis it is possible that economic conditions may weaken economic and fiscal conditions in the united states and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic and market conditions faced by the bank and its customers any sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions would adversely affect the bank 

market and interest rate risks 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the bank’s revenue interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability management committee which is established by the bank’s board of directors failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect the bank factors beyond the bank’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the bank’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

over the course of the last year we have maintained a moderate level of assetsensitivity as the market rates seemed more likely to increase than to decrease as risks shifted at the end of the year to be more balanced between higher or lower rates in the future the assetliability committee “alco” has undertaken strategies to reduce the level of assetsensitivity such as entering into rate floor agreements and increasing the use of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to synthetically convert floatingrate assets to fixedrate we anticipate moving towards a less assetsensitive interest rate risk position over the course of 2019 

interest rates on the bank’s financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to libor which could adversely impact the bank’s revenue expenses and value of those financial instruments 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority regulating the london interbank offered rate “libor” along with various other regulatory bodies announced that libor would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021 libor makes up the most liquid and common interest rate index in the world and is commonly referenced in financial instruments we have exposure to libor in various aspects through our financial contracts instruments that may be impacted include loans securities and derivatives among other financial contracts indexed to libor and that mature after december 31 2021 

while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of us financial market participants selected by the 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

federal reserve bank of new york started in may 2018 to publish the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as an alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by treasury securities that was selected by the alternative reference rate committee due to the depth and robustness of the us treasury repurchase market at this time it is impossible to predict whether sofr will become an accepted alternative to libor 

the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate such as sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could 

 the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain 

liquidity risk 

as a regulated entity we are subject to capital and liquidity requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth 

the bank is   subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the occ and the fdic including riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements and basel iii liquidity requirements capital needs may rise above normal levels when we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition risk profile and growth plans compliance with the capital requirements including leverage ratios may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels although the bank is not currently subject to the final lcr rule or the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” it is possible that the bank may become subject to a liquid coverage ratio requirement or other heightened liquidity requirements in the future if the occ or another banking regulator apply such a requirement to the bank as a supervisory matter in addition the bank may become subject to any rule implementing the nsfr that is promulgated in the future as a result the bank could be required to hold a higher portion of its assets in securities and other liquid assets and a lower portion of its assets in loans securities and other liquid assets generally have lower yields than loans of the type made by the bank for a summary of the capital rules to which we are subject see “capital standards – basel framework” on page 9  of this annual report on form 10k 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us and particular classes of securities that we issue the rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies ratings downgrades to us or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

strategic business and corporate governance risks 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us information security and vendor management processes are in place to actively identify manage and monitor actual and potential impacts 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

we have made and are continuing to make significant changes to the bank that include among other things organizational restructurings efficiency initiatives and replacement or upgrades of certain core technological systems to improve our control environment and operating efficiency the ultimate success and completion of these changes and their effect on the bank may vary significantly from initial planning which could materially adversely affect the bank 

over the last several years the bank has completed numerous improvement projects including the merger of its bank holding company into the bank combining the legal charters of our seven affiliate banks into one consolidating 15 loan operations sites into two upgrading our accounting systems installing a credit origination work flow system streamlining our small business and retail lending mortgage wealth management and foreign exchange businesses and investing in data quality and information security ongoing investment continues in a multiyear project to replace our core loan and deposit systems a collection of customerfacing digital capabilities and a variety of other projects to simplify how we do business 

these changes continue to be implemented some of the projects are fully completed and some projects are in their early stages by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings expected efficiencies and related items are subject to change and significant variability 

we may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these changes these may include significant time delays cost overruns loss of key people technological problems processing failures and other adverse developments any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems processes control environment procedures and employees which may adversely impact our customers and our ability to conduct business 

we have plans policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these potential adverse developments however there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately remediated the ultimate effect of any adverse development could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect the bank including its control environment operating efficiency and results of operations 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

operationaltechnology risks 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and the bank 

the bank has significant operations and a significant customer base in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy the bank’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to the bank’s property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the bank’s customers and in turn on the bank although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the bank’s operating results 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the bank we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations these efforts also include the management of controls to mitigate operational risks for programs and processes across the bank 

we could be adversely affected by financial technology advancements and other nontraditional lending and banking sources 

the ability to successfully remain competitive is dependent upon our ability to maintain a critical technological capability and to identify and develop new valueadded products for existing and future customers failure to do so could impede our time to market reduce customer product accessibility and weaken our competitive position 

cyber risk 

we are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations information security risks for large financial institutions such as the bank have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external third parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment any failure interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems misappropriation of funds and theft disclosure or misuse of proprietary bank or customer data while we have significant internal resources policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

model risk 

we use models in the management of the bank there is risk that these models are incorrect or inaccurate in various ways which can cause us to make nonoptimal decisions and this risk causes the bank to hold additional capital as a buffer against that risk 

we attempt to carefully develop document back test and validate the models used in the management of the bank including for example models used in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk and those used in projecting stress losses in various segments of our credit and securities portfolios and projecting net revenue under stress models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons however and cannot perfectly predict outcomes management decisions based in part on such models therefore can be suboptimal in addition in determining the bank’s capital needs under stress testing we attempt to specifically quantify the amounts by which model results could be incorrect and we hold material additional amounts of capital as a buffer against this “model risk” 

capitalfinancial reporting risks 

internal stress testing and capital management as well as provisions of the national bank act and occ regulations may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

although we are no longer subject to the ccar regime we are required to submit stress tests to the occ because the bank has assets in excess of 10 billion and we expect to continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypotheticallystressed economic conditions the stress testing and other applicable regulatory requirements may among other things require us to increase our capital levels limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under the national bank act and occ regulations certain capital transaction may be subject to the approval of the occ these requirements may limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the bank 

the bank must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by its banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions and the particular conditions risk profiles and growth plans of the bank compliance with capital requirements may limit the bank’s ability to expand and has required and may require the bank or its subsidiaries to raise additional capital these uncertainties and risks including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties may increase the bank’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk 

the bank is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the bank provides to its customers invests in and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the bank to comply before their formal adoption therefore identification interpretation and 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

as of december 31 2018  the bank had 1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to amegy bank “amegy” california bank  trust “cbt” and zions bank if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value the bank may have to take a charge related to the impairment of its goodwill such a charge would occur if the bank were to experience increases in the book value of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in the fair value of equity of a reporting unit a significant decline in the bank’s expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the bank’s common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein may necessitate the bank taking charges in the future related to the impairment of its goodwill future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of the appropriateness of the goodwill carrying value if the bank was to conclude in the future that a writedown of its goodwill is necessary it would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on the bank’s results of operations 

the bank may not be able to utilize the significant dta recorded on its balance sheet 

the bank’s balance sheet includes a significant dta we had net dtas of 130 million  at december 31 2018  compared with 93 million  at december 31 2017  the largest component of this asset results from additions to our alll for purposes of gaap in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes our ability to continue to record this dta is dependent on the bank’s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital in addition inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations currently no dtas are disallowed for regulatory purposes at the bank 

legal risks 

the doddfrank act imposes significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank act implementing regulations place significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions among other things the doddfrank act 

 the bank and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel systems consulting and other costs in order to comply with regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation and clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined individually and collectively regulations adopted under the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the bank’s and the financial services industry’s business financial condition including the bank’s ability to compete effectively with less regulated financial services providers and results of operations 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

other legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and earnings 

in addition to the doddfrank act described previously bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and accordingly we are subject to fdic insurance assessments   

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted however if adopted some of these proposals could adversely affect the bank by among other things impacting aftertax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting the bank’s ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of the bank’s funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that the bank could offer and requiring the bank to raise capital at inopportune times 

recent political developments could result in substantial changes in tax international trade immigration and other policies the extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain as are the potential direct and indirect impacts whether beneficial or adverse regulations and laws may be modified or repealed and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be adopted 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings the bank’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and increasingly aggressive enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations any   such   matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties including civil money penalties under applicable banking laws injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations including those relating to antimoney laundering matters have been increasing dramatically in addition any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings which may restrict or limit our activities 

the corporate and securities laws applicable to the bank are not as welldeveloped as those applicable to a statechartered corporation and this may impact the ability of the bank to effect corporate transactions in an efficient and optimal manner 

prior to the restructuring the corporate affairs of the bank’s holding company were governed by utah state law and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws including the securities act and the exchange act as administered by the sec each of these legal regimes is welldeveloped and used widely by public companies 

postrestructuring the bank’s corporate affairs are governed by the national bank act and related regulations administered by the occ with respect to securities matters the bank is not subject to the securities act but rather to occ regulations governing securities offerings the bank’s common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the exchange act which vests the occ with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the exchange act applicable to banks such as the bank though the bank currently makes and intends to continue to make filings required by the exchange act with the sec as a “voluntary filer” these occ statutory and regulatory regimes have been used by publiclytraded banking organizations relatively rarely and are not as welldeveloped as the corporate and securities law regimes applicable to corporations while certain specific risks associated with operating under these regimes are discussed below unless and until these regimes are further developed and established over time the uncertainty of how these regimes might apply to any 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

given corporate or securities matters may prevent us from effecting transactions in an efficient and optimal manner or perhaps at all 

differences between the national bank act and state law requirements in respect of mergers could result in the bank not being able to execute acquisitions as efficiently and advantageously as bank holding companies or other financial institutions 

unlike state corporate law the national bank act requires shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for exceptions in the case of various “minor” mergers such as a parent company’s merger with a subsidiary or an acquirer’s merger with an unaffiliated entity in which the shares issued by the acquirer do not exceed a designated percentage the national bank act and related regulations do not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of a nonaffiliated nonbank 

these differences could adversely affect the bank’s and other banks registered under the national bank act ability to efficiently consummate acquisition transactions in addition such differences could make the bank less competitive as a potential acquirer in certain circumstances given that the bank’s acquisition proposal may be conditioned on bank shareholder approval while the bank’s competitors’ proposals will not have such a condition 

differences between the national bank act and state law could result in the bank’s capacity to pay dividends and repurchase shares at any given time being different from the capacity that existed for zions bancorporation prior to the restructuring 

the regulations and limitations applicable to the bank relating to the payment of dividends and repurchases or redemptions of outstanding common and preferred shares differ from the limitations and considerations that applied to the bank’s holding company prior to the recent restructuring while the bank does not believe this change in legal restrictions resulting from the restructuring will constrain the bank from executing any capital plans that are currently contemplated or otherwise reasonably foreseeable in the near term there can be no assurance that the change in legal restrictions will not have an adverse effect on the bank’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase or redeem stock in the future 

shares of common stock of a national bank are assessable and this may cause investors to view the bank’s common stock less favorably than that of zions bancorporation prior to the restructuring 

the national bank act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable ie holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the occ in contrast the common stock of state corporations is not subject to assessment however the occ has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the national bank act assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank’s stock the bank’s common stock has a par value of 0001 moreover according to the occ it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation including robust capital standards prompt corrective action requirements and supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level nonetheless potential investors may be unfamiliar with the concept of assessment and as a result view the bank less favorably as an investment 

the ability of investors to access financial and other reports filed by the bank readily could be adversely affected if such reports were not able to be made available publicly through the sec or a system operated by the occ comparable to that of the sec 

the bank has been permitted and currently makes its exchange act filings as a “voluntary filer” with the sec there can be no assurance however that the occ or sec will continue to allow the bank to make filings as a voluntary filer or that the occ will develop a comparable system for making exchange act filings publicly available if the bank’s exchange act filings ceased to be as readily available as those of bank holding companies investors could view the bank less favorably 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the bank’s ability to issue securities in an optimal manner may be adversely affected by the fact that the occ’s securities offering regulations and organizational structure are less welldeveloped than those of the sec which applied to the bank’s holding company prior to the restructuring 

the sec maintains a welldeveloped regulatory regime and wellstaffed organization relating to securities offerings under or exempt from the securities act for example the sec has developed integrated disclosure rules which allow exchange act filings to be incorporated by reference into prospectuses distributed as required by the securities act in addition under the sec’s rules seasoned issuers who are timely in their filings are permitted to use “automatic shelf registration” allowing them to offer securities under a registration statement that is automatically effective upon filing the occ maintains its own securities offering regime applicable to national banks and their securities offerings which the bank will need to comply with in order to access the public capital markets similar to the sec’s offering rules the occ’s regime requires that registration statements be reviewed and declared or become effective however given that there are currently no other nationallycharted banks whose common stock has been issued under the occ’s securities offering regime it is unknown at this point whether and how the occ staff would review registration statements and unclear whether the occ would apply the same mechanics for automatic shelf registration filings used by secfilers or how more generally the occ will function as a securities regulator given the extent to and manner in which the bank has accessed capital markets historically or to which it currently contemplates accessing such markets the bank does not believe there will be a material adverse impact on the bank’s ability to access capital markets effectively although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and it is possible that operating under the occ’s securities offering regime could impede the bank’s ability to sell securities at the most advantageous times or to achieve optimum pricing in offerings 

the bank is subject to restrictions on permissible activities that would limit the types of business it may conduct and that may make acquisitions of other financial companies more challenging 

under applicable laws and regulations bank holding companies and banks are generally limited to business activities and investments that are related to banking or are financial in nature the range of permissible financial activities is set forth in the grammleachbliley act and is more limited for banks than for bank holding company organizations the differences relate mainly to insurance underwriting but not insurance agency activities and merchant banking but not brokerdealer and investment advisory activities merchant banking authority is an important power for financial institutions that desire to engage in a fullscale investment banking business and can also be important for institutions that wish to engage in private equity and proprietary investment business lines while historically the bank’s holding company did not seek to engage in activities available only to bank holding companies under the grammleachbliley act the bank is not able to engage in these activities loss of the bank holding company status resulting from the restructuring will make future acquisitions by the bank of financial institutions that have such operations more challenging 

the bank’s common stock is not an insured deposit 

shares of the bank’s common stock are not a bank deposit and therefore losses in value are not insured by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in shares of the bank’s common stock is inherently risky and is subject to the same market forces and investment risks that affect the price of common stock in any other company including the possible loss of some or all principal invested 

reputational risk 

the bank is presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational regulatorycompliance and legal risks 

a reputational risk council was established to monitor manage and develop strategies to effectively manage reputational risk which includes but is not limited to addressing communication logistics legal and regulatory issues

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

this form 10k presents nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to provide investors with additional information the adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are presented in the following schedules the bank considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons these nongaap financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the bank and for presentations of bank performance to investors the bank further believes that presenting these nongaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the bank on the same basis as that applied by management 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities although nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under gaap the following are the nongaap financial measures presented in this form 10k and a discussion of why management and investors use these nongaap measures

results of operations 

executive summary 

the bank reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2018  of 850 million  or 408  per diluted common share compared with 550 million  or 260  per diluted common share for 2017  although a reduction in the statutory tax rate contributed significantly to the improved earnings adjusted ppnr increased by 141 million or 14 to 11 billion the increase in adjusted ppnr was primarily the result of increased interest income due to loan growth and continued expense control additionally net income was positively impacted by improving credit quality as discussed in more detail below the bank’s efficiency ratio improved to 596 in 2018 from 623 in 2017 we expect to achieve a high singledigit rate of growth in ppnr during the next several years without assuming the benefit of further benchmark interest rate increases and continue to strive for improvements to our efficiency ratio going forward 

the bank’s net interest margin “nim” expanded 16 basis points “bps” for the full year of 2018 versus 2017 which was largely attributable to the favorable effects of higher interest rates on our moderately “asset sensitive” balance sheet – where asset yields repriced faster andor to a greater degree than liabilities see schedule 6 

asset quality improved considerably in 2018 reflecting strong improvements in the oil and gasrelated portfolio and generally stable to moderate improvements in other loan portfolios relative to 2017 total criticized classified and nonaccrual loans declined by 37 38 and 39 respectively net loan recoveries expressed as a percentage of average loans held for investment improved to net recoveries of 004 in 2018 from net chargeoffs of 017 in 2017 largely the result of loan recoveries in the oil and gas portfolio 

specifically for 2018 relative to 2017 the improved financial performance reflects 

 net earnings applicable to common shareholders increased by 55 over the prior year and earnings per diluted share increased by 57 a slightly stronger rate of growth than net earnings due to the repurchase of 129 million shares of bank common stock during 2018 

areas experiencing challenges in 2018   

although loan growth was generally consistent with the targeted levels we had established for 2018 we experienced increased competition during the year some of this competition came from nonbank financial institutions such as debt funds debt capital markets and covenantlight structures additionally some larger customers elected to refinance loans through the issuance of debt in the capital markets – an option that is not readily available to most of our customers 

loan growth of 19 billion or 4 exceeded deposit growth of 15 billion or 3 in 2018 consequently we relied more on wholesale funding to finance incremental balance sheet growth increasing our funding cost 

noninterest income from customerrelated fees increased 3  in 2018 from the prior year period which was less than the targeted growth goal we experienced strength in corporate investment services and wealth management

net interest income 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities and is more than threequarters of our revenue net interest income is derived from both the volume of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and the net yield earned on the assets and paid on the liabilities 

net interest income improved by 165 million  during 2018 compared with 2017 to 22 billion  an increase of 8 for 2018  taxableequivalent net interest income was 23 billion  compared with 21 billion  and 19 billion  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 21  for 2018 and 35  for all prior periods the increase over 2017 and the previous increase over 2016 were driven by several factors including average loan growth noninterestbearing deposit stability disciplined deposit pricing and increases in benchmark interest rates the increase from 2016 to 2017 was further impacted by a larger average securities portfolio balance we are not assuming any further increases in benchmark rates in our forecasts however because of loan growth and the benefit of our noninterestbearing deposits we expect net interest income to increase at a moderate pace in 2019 when compared with 2018 

net interest margin and interest rate spreads in 2018  vs 2017 

the nim was 361  and 345  for 2018  and 2017  respectively when comparing 2018 with 2017 changes in asset mix resulted in higher average loans lower average securities and money market investments and higher average interestbearing deposits and wholesale borrowings balances to fund overall balance sheet growth a significant source of nim expansion is the increasing value of noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts in the rising interest rate environment expansion of nim reflects a higher loan yield with only a moderate increase in funding costs funding balance sheet growth with wholesale borrowings reduced spreads and negatively impacted nim although it was accretive to net interest income the nim was also positively impacted by increases in the federal funds target rate during 2018 average interestearning assets increased 16 billion from 2017 with average rates improving 35 bps average interestbearing liabilities increased 15 billion and average rates also increased 35 bps over the same period 

the average balance of our investment securities portfolio decreased 01 billion  while yearend balances decreased 05 billion our average lending portfolio increased 19 billion  to 454 billion  an increase of 4  the net earning asset growth was funded through a mix of deposits and wholesale borrowings 

interest expense increased 124 million  compared to 2017 results attributable to both an increase in the cost and quantity of deposits and wholesale funding interest expense on deposits increased 76 million  on 294 billion  of average interestbearing deposits 

the increase in the average loan portfolio was due to growth in 14 family residential commercial and industrial and municipal lending yields on average balances increased by 43 bps 45 bps and 20 bps in the commercial cre and consumer portfolios respectively much of the consumer growth was in consumer 14 family residential where our yields are generally lower than on commercial loans the federal funds target rate increased nine times beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 which has had a positive impact on nim and spreads as our earning assets generally reprice more quickly than our funding sources a portion of our variablerate loans were not affected by these changes primarily due to longer reset frequency or because a substantial portion of our earning assets are tied to longerterm rates indices which rates were impacted by a relatively flat yield curve for much of 2018 additionally nim benefited from fdicsupported loans by 1 and 3 bps in 2018 and 2017 respectively we expect moderate to strong growth in 14 family municipal commercial and industrial and owneroccupied loans and stabletomoderate growth in cre and oil and gasrelated loans 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided us with lowcost funding and comprised 45  of average total deposits which totaled 532 billion  in 2018 compared with 46  of average total deposits which totaled 522 billion  for 2017 average interestbearing deposits increased 3  in 2018 compared with 2017 over the past 12 months the federal reserve has increased the overnight benchmark federal funds rate by 100 bps while the rate 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

paid on the bank’s interestbearing deposits increased 25 bps implying a deposit beta of 25 we have been selectively increasing deposit pricing in certain markets and with certain clients but we have not generally experienced significant pressure to broadly increase deposit rates although we consider a wide variety of sources when determining our funding needs we benefit from access to deposits from a significant number of small to midsized business customers which provide us with a low cost of funds and have a positive impact on our nim including wholesale borrowings the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased 35 bps 

the average balance of longterm debt increased 118 million  compared with 2017 while the average rate decreased 58 bps during the third quarter 2018 the bank issued a 500 million senior note with an interest rate of 35 overall interest expense on longterm debt increased 4 million  the bank has used shortterm federal home loan bank “fhlb” borrowings to fund some of its balance sheet growth during the past couple of years average shortterm debt grew 05 billion  and the rate paid increased 88 bps further changes in shortterm borrowings will be driven by balancing changes in deposits and loans as we do not foresee significant increases in investment security balances 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 328  in 2018 and 327  in 2017 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim 

interest rate spreads and margin are impacted by the mix of assets we hold the composition of our loan and securities portfolios and the type of funding used we expect the yield of the loan portfolio to increase somewhat due to the effects of rising interest rates in 2018 partially offset by a continued modest change in the mix of the portfolio increasing concentration in loweryielding residential mortgages as well as reduced income from higheryielding loans purchased from the fdic in 2009 

our estimates of the bank’s interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes although the federal funds target rate has increased 225 bps since the fourth quarter of 2015 we have not experienced significant migration of our noninterestbearing deposits which we attribute to the operating nature of many of our deposit accounts further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate and market risk management” on page 62

net interest margin and interest rate spreads in 2017 vs 2016 

the nim was 345 and 337 for 2017  and 2016  respectively compared with 2016 changes in asset mix resulted in higher securities and loan balances lower balances in money market investments and higher balances of wholesale borrowings to fund overall balance sheet growth moving funds from money market investments to loans and securities had a positive impact on nim the nim was also positively impacted by several increases in shortterm interest rates average interestearning assets increased 47 billion from 2016 with average rates improving 14 bps average interestbearing liabilities increased 36 billion and average rates increased 8 bps over the same period 

the average loan portfolio increased 14 billion or 3 from 2016 with the majority of growth coming from 14 family residential commercial and industrial and municipal lending yields on average balances increased overall buoyed by increases of 16 bps and 26 bps in the commercial and cre portfolios respectively yields on average consumer balances were relatively flat during 2017 additionally nim benefited from fdicsupported loans by approximately 3 bps and 4 bps in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

average availableforsale “afs” securities balances increased 54 billion during 2017 and yields were also up 17 bps due to the effect of rising interest rates on variablerate securities moderation in the amount of prepayments on agencyguaranteed mortgagebacked securities and investment in products providing a higher yield than the

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided us with lowcost funding and comprised 456 of average total deposits which totaled 522 billion in 2017 compared with 444 of average total deposits which totaled 506 billion for 2016 average interestbearing deposits increased only 1 in 2017 compared with 2016 the average balance of longterm debt decreased 286 million compared with 2016 and the average rate increased 61 bps in the current year while interest expense decreased 13 million from 2016 the rate increased because the remaining debt was at a higher average rate than the rate on debt that matured and was available to be called 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 327 and 323 for 2017 and 2016 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim refer to the “liquidity risk management” section beginning on page 65  for more information on how we manage liquidity risk

provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the alll at an adequate level based on the inherent risks in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments “rulc” at an adequate level based on the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the alll and rulc we perform periodic evaluations of our various loan portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs credit quality trends and external factors see note 6   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

“credit risk management” on page 52  for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

the provision for loan losses was 39 million  in 2018 compared with 24 million  in 2017 credit quality was strong throughout 2018 with continued significant improvement in the oil and gasrelated portfolio classified and nonaccrual loans in the total portfolio declined by 435 million and 162 million respectively net recoveries totaled 16 million in 2018 compared with 73 million in net chargeoffs in 2017 these improvements in both credit quality and net chargeoffs resulted in the lower provision 

the provision for unfunded lending commitments was 1 million  in 2018 compared with 7 million  in 2017 the change in the provision in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to increased unfunded lending commitments partially offset by credit quality improvements in the oil and gasrelated portfolio the negative provision in 2017 was primarily due to improved credit quality assessments related to obligations for credits outside the oil and gasrelated portfolio along with declining oil and gasrelated exposure from quarter to quarter the provision for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations fundings and changes in credit quality 

the allowance for credit losses “acl” which is the combination of both the alll and the rulc decreased by 24 million during 2018 strong credit quality in 2018 highlighted by improvement in the oil and gasrelated portfolio was responsible for much of this reduction further increasing nonoil and gasrelated commercial and industrial and 14 family residential mortgage exposure also improved the risk profile of the total portfolio 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield noninterest income accounted for 18 and 20 of total revenue during 2018 and 2017 respectively for 2018  noninterest income was 552 million  compared with 544 million  in 2017  and 516 million  in 2016  

during 2018 we experienced strength in corporate investment services and wealth management income loan syndication fees bankcard fees and merchant account fees while experiencing declines in depositrelated service charges and mortgagerelated fees the improvement in corporate investment services income was primarily due to increases in the revenue share received from the higher balances in money market mutual funds rising interest rates resulted in improved returns for money market mutual funds thus driving the increase in balances deposit service charge income experienced slight resistance due in part to rising interest rates as discussed below rising interest rates also adversely impacted mortgage banking activity 

we believe a subtotal of customerrelated fees provides a better view of income over which we have more direct control it excludes items such as dividends insurancerelated income marktomarket adjustments on certain derivatives and securities gains and losses

schedule 7  presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

schedule 7   

noninterest income 



service charges and fees on deposit accounts decreased by 5 million or 3 during 2018 and has been static or slightly decreasing for the last several years a primary driver of the decline in service charges and fees was softening of high transaction volume customers a secondary driver of this decline could be attributed to rising interest rates which may influence increases in the earning credit rate due to customer expectations the earnings credit rate ecr is a daily calculation of soft dollar credit that a bank pays on customer’s noninterestbearing deposits on account analysis this credit can be used to offset service charges on a customer’s analyzed account as the ecr increases customers offset more of their deposit service charges thus the potential softening in noninterest income 

other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of automated teller machine “atm” fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit and credit card interchange fees cash management fees and other miscellaneous fees increased by 11 million  or 5 compared with 2017 the increase relates mainly to higher credit card interchange fees and exchange and other fees in 2017 other service charges commissions and fees increased by 9 million compared with 2016 the increase was primarily a result of the same items mentioned previously 

wealth management and trust income increased by 9 million  or 21 the change was due to trust income with improvement in both corporate and personal trust revenue due to platform and product simplifications wealth management and trust income increased 5 million between 2017 and 2016 for the same reasons 

securities gains net decreased 13 million during 2018 as a result of 13 million of increases in the market value of the bank’s small business investment company “sbic” investments in 2017 that did not reoccur to the same magnitude in 2018 securities gains net in 2017 increased from 2016 as a result of higher increases in the market values of the bank’s sbic investments 

dividends and other investment income increased 16 million between 2017 and 2016 primarily due to 14 million of gains across many of our cost and equity method investments 

loan sales and servicing income decreased 10 million between 2017 and 2016 during 2017 we ceased selling servicingreleased mortgage loans to freddie mac and therefore no longer received the associated servicing premiums for doing so which decreased income by 11 million in general servicing income increased slightly in 2017 we also had particularly large valuation gains during 2016 on agricultural loan servicing assets accounted for at fair value which did not repeat to the same extent in 2017

noninterest expense 

as mentioned previously we delivered on our commitment to limit adjusted noninterest expense growth in 2018 to increase only slightly relative to our 2017 results both noninterest expense and adjusted noninterest expense were 17 billion in 2018 compared to 16 billion in both 2017 and 2016 noninterest expense increased 29 million or 2 and adjusted noninterest expense increased 31 million also 2 in 2018 see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 27  for more information regarding the calculation of adjusted noninterest expense 

we have developed a culture that continually seeks to streamline and make more simple and efficient the processes required to operate to this end in 2018 we successfully completed the merger of the holding company with and into the bank subsidiary the consolidation of our seven bank charters at the end of 2015 almost entirely eliminated the need for the holding company the consolidation of the holding company into the bank reduced duplicative regulatory examinations and certain regulatory requirements the bank remains focused on expense control efforts while continuing to invest in technology initiatives 

schedule 8  presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

schedule 8   

noninterest expense 



salaries and employee benefits increased by 64 million or 6 in 2018 compared with 2017 salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to a 29 million increase in base salaries resulting from salary increases related to the tax cuts and jobs act merit increases and increased headcount and a 19 million increase in incentive compensation of which 7 million relates to the tax cuts and jobs act the remaining 16 million increase was primarily a result of an 8 million increase in the bank’s medical plans and a 7 million increase in the bank’s contribution to the employee 401k plan as a result of improved financial performance including the profit sharing contribution which increased to 25 of eligible compensation in 2018 from 175 in 2017 our investment in major systems projects has led to headcount increases in more highly compensated roles 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 28 million or 3 in 2017 compared with 2016 base salaries were up in 2017 as employee salary expense rose roughly in line with inflation employee bonuses were up partially due to lower incentive compensation for management in 2016 and larger commission expense in 2017 benefits expense increased 11 million or 8 in 2017 primarily due to higher costs in the bank’s medical plans and an increase in profit sharing expense

salaries and employee benefits 



occupancy expense was up 3 million  or 2 in 2018 primarily due to increased property taxes and depreciation expense partially offset by increased rental income occupancy expense was up 4 million in 2017 when compared to 2016 we placed a newly constructed office building into operation during the first quarter of 2017 and increased rental income from higher occupancies of leased space began in the latterhalf of 2017 and 2018 

furniture and equipment expense decreased 4 million or 3 in 2018 primarily from decreased maintenance expense partially offset by increased amortization of capitalized software furniture and equipment expense increased 5 million in 2017 mainly due to increased amortization expense during 2017 we successfully implemented the first phase of the tcs bαncs ®  core servicing system the second phase of the core transformation project which replaces the bank’s primary commercial lending systems was deployed in the february of 2019 and we are in the process of finalizing the full implementation 

the provision for unfunded lending commitments was 1 million in 2018 compared to 7 million in 2017 and 10 million in 2016 and is discussed previously in the provision for credit losses section 

professional and legal services decreased 5 million from 2017 to 52 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily a result of lower consulting fees related to our simplification and technology initiatives 

fdic premiums were 50 million  53 million  and 40 million  in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the decrease in 2018 is primarily due to the elimination of the fdic surcharge for large banks because the required deposit insurance fund reserve ratio has been met the increase during 2017 when compared to 2016 was due to higher deposit bases and the fdic’s increase in deposit insurance assessments that occurred in the third quarter of 2016 this increase during 2017 was somewhat offset by a reduction in the bank’s overall rate resulting from the consolidation of the individual bank charters 

other noninterest expense was 197 million  in 2018 compared with 231 million  in 2017 this decrease was primarily due to the onetime 12 million charitable contribution made at the end of 2017 and a decrease in employee and operational expenses resulting from the bank’s simplification and efficiencies initiatives 

in october 2018 the bank decided to terminate its pension plan subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approval completion of this termination is expected in early 2020 plan participant benefits will not be disadvantaged because of this decision at the time of final liquidation additional noninterest expense will be recognized for pension amounts remaining in other comprehensive income “oci” as well as expense related to purchasing annuities for participants who elect that distribution method as of december 31 2018 the pension plan was overfunded by 19 million  compared with 14 million  as of december 31 2017 the qualified pension oci balance at december 31 2018 was a 27 million  loss before adjusting for tax effects the expense related to purchasing annuities is highly dependent on individual participant elections between lumpsum distribution options 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

and an annuity option in addition to market competitiveness in the annuity bid process the current estimate of this expense is 5 million to 15 million and is subject to change depending upon the previously mentioned factors

income tax expense was 259 million  in 2018  344 million  in 2017  and 236 million  in 2016  our effective income tax rates were 227 in 2018  368 in 2017  and 335 in 2016  the income tax rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance the income tax rate for 2018 was positively impacted by the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate to 21 from 35 due to the tax cuts and jobs act which was effective january 1 2018 this rate benefit was partially reduced by the nondeductibility of fdic premiums certain executive compensation and other fringe benefits as enacted by the new tax law 

the tax rate for 2017 was also impacted by a onetime 18 million benefit to tax expense related to the reevaluation of state tax positions an excess tax benefit of 9 million from the implementation of new accounting guidance related to sharebased compensation and an estimated net dta writeoff of 47 million through income tax expense associated with the decrease in the federal income tax rate from the passage of new legislation 

the bank continued to invest in technology initiatives and increased investment in municipal securities during 2018 2017 and 2016 generating tax credits and nontaxable income that benefited the tax rate each year 

we had a net dta balance of 130 million at december 31 2018  compared with 93 million at december 31 2017  the increase in the net dta resulted primarily from the increase in accrued compensation and unrealized losses in oci related to securities and the decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to the deferred gain on a prior period debt exchange net chargeoffs exceeding the provision for loan losses an increase in deferred loan fees and accelerated tax deductions on certain technology initiatives and depreciable property during 2018 offset some of the overall increase in dta we did not record any additional valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2018 

note 19  of the notes to consolidated financial statements discloses more information about the bank’s evaluation of its dta including any potential additional valuation allowances and the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act on the bank 

preferred stock dividends and redemption 

in 2018  preferred stock dividends were 34 million a decrease of 6 million from 40 million in 2017  in 2017  preferred stock dividends decreased by 8 million from 2016  we completed tender offers of 144 million of series f and 118 million of series i j and g in the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 respectively preferred dividends are expected to be 34 million for 2019 see further details in note 13  of the notes to consolidated financial statements

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases 

schedule 5    which we referenced in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of our interestearning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another goal is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets as a result of this goal we redeployed funds from loweryielding money market investments in addition to using wholesale borrowings to purchase agency securities 

average interestearning assets were 624 billion  in 2018  compared with 609 billion  in the previous year average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 94  in both 2018  and 2017  

average loans were 454 billion  in 2018  and 435 billion  in 2017  average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 68  in 2018  compared with 67  in 2017

loans held for sale 

loans held for sale were 93 million  at december 31 2018  compared with 44 million  at december 31 2017  and are generally consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market as of december 31 2018 the majority of the loans held for sale consisted primarily of a small amount of commercial loans

loan portfolio by type and maturity 



as of december 31 2018  net loans and leases were 47 billion  reflecting a 4  increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

loan portfolio growth during 2018 was widespread across loan products and geographies with particular strength in   consumer 14 family residential commercial and industrial municipal and commercial owneroccupied loans the growth in the loan portfolio was primarily at cbt and zions bank 

of the significant increases within the portfolio consumer 14 family residential loans increased 514 million commercial and industrial loans increased 510 million municipal loans increased 390 million and commercial owneroccupied loans increased 373 million the impact of these increases was partially offset by a decrease of 164 million in our cre term portfolio 

we expect moderate total loan and lease growth during 2019 primarily in consumer 14 family residential municipal commercial and industrial and commercial owneroccupied nonnre we expect stable to moderate growth in oil and gas and cre loans partially offset by a moderate decline in the national real estate “nre” loan portfolio 

loans serviced for the benefit of others increased to 39 billion during 2018 from 37 billion in 2017 

other noninterestbearing investments 

during 2018 the bank increased its shortterm borrowings with the fhlb by 900 million this increase required a further investment in fhlb activity stock which consequently increased by 36 million during the year aside from this increase other noninterestbearing investments remained relatively stable as set forth in the following schedule schedule 15  summarizes our other noninterestbearing investments

see notes 11  and 12   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity risk management” on page 65  for additional information on funding and borrowed funds 

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the bank’s operations management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance the board of directors has appointed a risk oversight committee “roc” that consists of appointed board members who oversee the bank’s risk management processes the roc meets on a regular basis to monitor and review enterprise risk management “erm” policies and activities as required by its charter the roc performs oversight for various erm activities and approves erm policies and activities as detailed in the roc charter 

management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which the bank’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks these risks are overseen by the various management committees of which the enterprise risk management committee is the focal point for the monitoring and review of enterprise risk 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

the board of directors through the roc is responsible for approving the overall credit policies relating to the management of the credit risk of the bank in addition the roc oversees and monitors adherence to key credit policies and the credit risk appetite as defined in the risk appetite framework additionally the board has established the credit risk committee chaired by the chief credit officer and consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk for the bank and approving changes to the bank’s credit policies 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit risk management and credit examination functions our credit policies place emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses these formal credit policies and procedures provide the bank with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level credit examinations related to the acl are reported to both the audit committee and the roc 

our credit risk management function is separate from the lending function and strengthens control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities in addition we have a welldefined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio and we utilize a comprehensive loan riskgrading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore the internal credit examination department which is independent of the lending function periodically conducts examinations of the bank’s lending departments and credit activities these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan riskgrading administration and compliance with credit policies new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the new initiative review committee 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio we attempt to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty generally our loan portfolio is well diversified however due to the nature of our geographical footprint there are certain significant concentrations primarily in cre and oil and gasrelated lending we have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on leveraged lending municipal lending oil and gasrelated lending and various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary the recent growth in construction and land development loan commitments is within the established concentration limits our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographical footprint of our banking affiliates 

as we continue to monitor our concentration risk the composition of our loan portfolio has slightly changed total commercial loans were 52 of the total portfolio compared with 51 at december 31 2017 cre loans declined to 24 of the total portfolio compared with 25 at december 31 2017 consumer loans remained at 24 of the total loan portfolio at december 31 2018 and 2017

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

approximately 13  of the cre term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2018  for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to five years the remaining 87  of cre loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project loantovalue ratio and occupancy rates 

approximately 134 million  or 9  of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2018  consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects 

underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily and hospitality construction projects we require substantial preleasingleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan significant consideration is given to the forecasted market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower generally by our internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed a new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness 

advance rates ie loan commitments will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and homes not under contract and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement 

the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing cre loans for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes this repayment source into consideration 

when we modify or extend a loan we also give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether we have granted a concession in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists however if additional collateral is obtained or if a guarantor exists who has the 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

capacity and willingness to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared with the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

a decrease in oil and gas prices could potentially produce an adverse impact on our cre loan portfolio within texas however based upon generally strong equity and cash flow coverage levels and sponsor support for the various properties we do not expect a material amount of losses within this portfolio in 2019 our largest cre credit exposures in texas are to the multifamily office and retail sectors at december 31 2018  the cre loan portfolio mix in texas was 71  commercial term 17  commercial construction 10  residential construction and 2  land development 

consumer loans 

we have mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality we generally hold variablerate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixedrate loans to third parties including federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards 

we are engaged in home equity credit line “hecl” lending at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  our hecl portfolio totaled   29 billion  and 28  billion respectively the following schedule describes the composition of our hecl portfolio by lien status 

schedule 20 

hecl portfolio by lien status 



zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

at december 31 2018  loans representing less than 1 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateralvalue at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination 

approximately 89  of our hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 18  of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years we regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates the analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment the ratio of net chargeoffs to average balances at yearend 2018 and 2017 for the hecl portfolio was 002  see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit quality of this portfolio 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned “oreo” decreased to 055  at december 31 2018  compared with 093  at december 31 2017  

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2018  decreased to 252  million from 414  million at december 31 2017  primarily in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio however nonaccrual loans slightly increased in the commercial real estate term loan portfolio the largest total decrease in nonaccrual loans occurred at amegy mainly due to improvements in the oil and gasrelated portfolio 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” following for more information bank policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to cre term loans see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on nonaccrual loans

troubled debt restructurings “tdrs” are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties and for whom we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider tdrs decreased 24 million or 11 during 2018 primarily due to payments and payoffs commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such consumer loan tdrs may include firstlien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether a loan should be returned to accrual status 

schedule 22   

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 



in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs

allowance for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the alll we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance our loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the following schedule shows the changes in the allowance for loan losses and a summary of loan loss experience

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the bank’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the bank including interest rate and market risk management the board has established alco consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the bank alco establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews with the roc the limits and limit exceptions reported by management 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to manage the balance sheet to reduce net income volatility due to changes in interest rates 

over the course of the last year we have maintained a moderate level of assetsensitivity as the market rates seemed more likely to increase than to decrease as risks shifted at the end of the year to be more balanced between higher or lower rates in the future alco has undertaken strategies to reduce the level of asset sensitivity such as entering into rate floor agreements and increasing the use of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to synthetically convert floatingrate assets to fixedrate we anticipate moving towards a less assetsensitive interest rate risk position over the course of 2019 

interest rate risk measurement 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods net interest income simulation or earnings at risk “ear” and economic value of equity at risk “eve” ear analyzes the expected change in near term one year net interest income in response to changes in interest rates in the eve method we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates 

ear is an estimate of the change in total net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments over a oneyear period ear is measured simulating net interest income under several different scenarios including parallel and nonparallel interest rate shifts across the yield curve taking into account deposit repricing assumptions and estimates of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio eg a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lowerrate environment our policy contains a trigger for a 10 decline in ratesensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps as of december 31 2018 the ear declined by 12 for a 200 bps decline in rates this trigger violation informed our decision to move to a less assetsensitive position throughout 2019 

eve is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities we measure changes in the dollar amount of eve for parallel shifts in interest rates due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in eve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney interest rate caps or limits on loans which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for lowrate mortgages 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

in a higherrate environment our policy contains a trigger for an 8 decline in eve as well as a risk capacity of a 10 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps exceptions to the eve limits are subject to notification and approval by the roc 

estimating the impact on net interest income and eve requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration eg customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit competitive pricing eg existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates loan and security prepayments and the effects of other similar embedded options as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans we also calculate the sensitivity of ear and eve results to key assumptions as most of our liabilities are comprised of indeterminate maturity and managed rate deposits the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for these deposits such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options we use historical regression analysis as a guide for setting such assumptions however due to the current low interest rate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit behavior may not reflect actual future results additionally competition for funding in the marketplace has and may again result in changes to deposit pricing on interestbearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as libor or the federal funds rate 

under most rising interest rate environments we would expect some customers to move balances from demand deposits to interestbearing accounts such as money market savings or certificates of deposit the models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration 

in addition we assume certain correlation rates often referred to as a “deposit beta” of interestbearing deposits wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared to changes in benchmark interest rates generally certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate while interestonchecking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate actual results may differ materially due to factors including competitive pricing money supply credit worthiness of the bank and so forth however we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions 

the aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in schedule 26  

schedule 26   

deposit assumptions 



as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows ear or percentage change in net interest income based on a static balance sheet size in the first year after the interest rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

schedule 27   

income simulation – change in net interest income 



 for nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 46 if the weighted average deposit beta increased to 56 it would decrease the ear in the 200bp shock from 51 to 28 

the ear analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of rates the yield curve typically does not move in a parallel manner during the past year an increase in shortterm rates has led to a flatter yield curve as longerterm rates have not increased at the same pace as shortterm rates if we consider a flattening rate shock where the shortterm rate moves 200bp but the tenyear rate only moves 30bp the increase in earnings is 43 lower over 12 months compared with the parallel 200bp rate shock 

for comparative purposes the december 31 2017 measures as presented in the following schedule 

 the assetsensitivity as measured by ear increased slightly yearoveryear due to changes in the investment securities and funding compositions 

schedule 28 

changes in economic value of equity 

as of the dates indicated the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in eve under parallel interest rate changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps for   nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 46 if the weighted average deposit beta increased to 56 it would decrease the eve in the 200bp shock from 56 to 77 



 for comparative purposes the december 31 2017  measures are presented in the following schedule the changes in eve measures from december 31 2017  are driven by increases in interest rates which increase the expected life of certain assets and decrease the expected life of certain liabilities 





zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the bank’s assetliability management posture at december 31 2018  204 billion of the bank’s commercial lending and cre loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate loans approximately 98 are tied to either the prime rate or libor for these variablerate loans we have executed 688 million of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps additionally assetsensitivity is reduced due to 48 million of variablerate loans being priced at floored rates at december 31 2018  which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 74 bps at december 31 2018  we also had 33 billion of variablerate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate consumer loans approximately 9 million were priced at floored rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 81 bps 

see notes 3  and 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

market risk – fixed income 

we engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2018  we had a relatively small amount 106 million  of trading assets and 85 million  of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 148 million  and 95 million  respectively at december 31 2017  

we are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value we are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2018  the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs securities decreased by 114 million due largely to changes in the interest rate environment compared with a 22 million decrease in the same prior year period 

market risk – equity investments 

through our equity investment activities we own equity securities that are publiclytraded in addition we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and an fhlb that are not publiclytraded the accounting for equity investments may use the cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs we are exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by the bank’s equity investments committee consisting of members of management 

we hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly prepublic companies primarily through various sbic venture capital funds our equity exposure to these investments was approximately 132 million and 127 million at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively on occasion some of the companies within our sbic investments may issue an initial public offering in this case the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment which can introduce additional market risk 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity refers to our capacity to meet our cash and collateral obligations and to manage both expected and unexpected cash flows without adversely impacting the operations or financial strength of the bank sources of liquidity include both traditional forms of funding such as deposits borrowings and equity and unencumbered assets such as marketable loans and securities 

since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds for our customers’ credit needs capital plan actions anticipated financial and contractual obligations which include withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardapproved corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines such as a 30day liquidity coverage ratio that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the bank as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the bank 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed by the treasury department under the direction of the corporate treasurer with oversight by alco the treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the bank’s liquidity policy these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policy also must be approved by the bank’s ermc and the board of directors the bank has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk the policy requires the bank to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows in the event of a severe liquidity crisis throughout 2018 and as of december 31 2018 the bank complied with this policy 

liquidity regulation 

upon passage of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the bank is no longer subject to the enhanced prudential standards for liquidity management reg yy however the bank continues to perform liquidity stress tests and assess its portfolio of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under the stress scenarios although the bank is no longer subject to the regulations of the final lcr rule it exceeds the regulatory requirements that mandates a buffer of securities and other liquid assets to cover 70 of 30day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated therein 

liquidity management actions 

the bank’s consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements was 24 billion at december 31 2018  compared to 16 billion at december 31 2017 during 2018 the primary sources of cash were from 1 a net increase in deposits 2 net cash provided by operating activities 3 shortterm borrowings 4 a net decrease in investment securities and 5 the issuance of longterm debt the primary uses of cash during the same period were primarily from 1 loan originations 2 repurchases of our common stock and 3 dividends on common and preferred stock 

the bank’s loan to total deposit ratio has remained consistent and was 86 at december 31 2018  compared with 85 at december 31 2017 the bank’s core deposits consisting of noninterestbearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits and time deposits under 250000 was 512 billion at december 31 2018 compared with 507 billion at december 31 2017 

total deposits were 541 billion at december 31 2018  compared with 526 billion at december 31 2017  the increase during 2018 was a result of a 12 billion and 05 billion increase in time deposits and savings and money market respectively partially offset by a 241 million decrease in noninterestbearing deposits 

during 2018 the bank issued a 500 million senior note with an interest rate of 35 and a maturity date of august 27 2021 at december 31 2018  maturities of our longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from august 2021 to september 2028 also during 2018 the bank called and redeemed 162 million of 565 subordinated notes maturing november 15 2023 

the bank’s cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses increased to 237 million during 2018  from 118 million during 2017  primarily due to an increase in deposits shortterm borrowings and longterm debt and an increase in interest rates additionally the bank paid approximately 236 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock during 2018  compared with 129 million during 2017  dividends paid per common share have increased gradually from 012 in the third quarter of 2017  to 030 in the fourth  quarter of 2018  in february 2019 the board approved a quarterly common dividend of 030 per share 

general financial market and economic conditions impact our access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets for the bank is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings all of the credit rating agencies rate the bank’s debt at an investmentgrade level the bank’s credit ratings have continued to improve during 2018 and are presented in the following schedule 

credit ratings 



the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and from time to time have been a significant source of funding zions bancorporation na is a member of the fhlb of des moines the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements the bank is required to invest in fhlb and federal reserve stock to maintain their borrowing capacity 

at december 31 2018  the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 138 billion compared with 147 billion at december 31 2017  loans with a carrying value of approximately 226 billion  at december 31 2018  have been pledged at the fhlb of des moines and the federal reserve as collateral for current and potential borrowings compared with 256 billion  at december 31 2017  at december 31 2018 we had 45 billion of shortterm fhlb borrowings outstanding and no longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding compared with 36 billion of shortterm fhlb borrowings and no longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding at december 31 2017 at december 31 2018  our total investment in fhlb and federal reserve stock was 190 million and 139 million respectively compared with 154 million and 184 million at december 31 2017  

our investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture taken during 2018  heldtomaturity “htm” and afs investment securities’ activities resulted in a net decrease in investment securities and a net 130 million increase in cash compared with a net 22 billion decrease in cash for 2017  

maturing balances in the bank’s loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows lending activity during 2018  resulted in a net cash outflow of 19 billion compared with a net cash outflow of 21 billion during 2017  

during 2018  we paid income taxes of 207 million compared to 246 million during 2017  

we may also from time to time issue additional preferred stock senior or subordinated notes or other forms of capital or debt instruments depending on our capital funding assetliability management or other needs as market conditions warrant and subject to any required regulatory approvals management believes that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably foreseeable shortterm and intermediateterm demands

contractual obligations 

schedule 29  summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018  

schedule 29   

contractual obligations 



 in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 29  we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business some of these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually and in certain cases to secure favorable pricing concessions we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

we also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

operational risk management 

operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events in our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk we have an erm department whose responsibility is to help employees management and the board of directors to assess understand measure manage and monitor risk in accordance with our risk appetite framework we have documented both controls and the control selfassessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and the fdicia 

to manage and minimize our operational risk we have in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate our systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

those systems to our legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the bank’s compliance risk management internal audit and credit examination departments reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data in addition the data governance department has key governance surrounding data integrity and availability oversight further we have key programs and procedures to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters we also mitigate certain operational risks through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

we are continually improving our oversight of operational risk including enhancement of risk identification risk and control selfassessments and antifraud measures which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees the operational risk committee reports to the ermc which reports to the roc key measures have been established to increase oversight by erm and operational risk management through the strengthening of new initiative reviews enhancements to the enterprise procurement and third party risk management framework enhancements to the business continuity and disaster recovery programs and enterprise security programs and the establishment of fraud risk oversight incident response oversight and technology project oversight programs significant enhancements have also been made to governance technology and reporting including the establishment of policy and committee governance programs the implementation of a governance risk and control solution and the creation of an enterprise risk profile and an operational risk profile along with business line risk profiles in addition the establishment of an enterprise exam management department has standardized our response and reporting and increased our effectiveness and efficiencies with regulatory examinations communications and issues management 

the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our critical systems sometimes referred to as hacking cyber fraud cyber attacks cyber terrorism or other similar names also continue to grow given the importance and increasing sophistication of cyber attacks the bank has designated cyber risk a level one risk in its risk taxonomy which places it at the highest level of oversight with its other top risks 

capital management 

overview 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” chaired by the chief financial officer and consisting of members of management whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the bank other major cmc responsibilities include 

 the bank has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the bank to

merger of bank holding company into bank 

on september 30 2018 the bank completed the merger of zions bancorporation its former bank holding company with and into the bank formerly known as zb na in order to reduce organizational complexity the restructuring eliminated the bank holding company structure and associated regulatory framework and resulted in zb na being renamed zions bancorporation national association and becoming the toplevel entity within our corporate structure the bank’s primary regulator is now the occ the bank continues to be subject to examinations by the cfpb with respect to consumer financial regulations under the national bank act and occ regulations certain capital transaction may be subject to the approval of the occ 

stress testing 

as a result of the financial stability oversight council’s action on september 12 2018 and the merger of the holding company into the bank on september 30 2018 the bank is no longer considered a systemically important financial institution under the doddfrank act the bank expects to have greater flexibility in the active management of shareholders’ equity the bank expects to continue to utilize stress testing as the primary mechanism to inform its decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypotheticallystressed economic conditions therefore the timing and amount of capital actions will be subject to various factors including the banks financial performance and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 

capital management actions 

during 2018 the bank repurchased 129 million shares of common stock for 670 million at an average price of 5177 per share in february 2019 the bank announced that the board approved a plan to repurchase 275 million of common stock during the first quarter of 2019 the timing and amount of additional common share repurchases will be subject to various factors including the banks financial performance business needs prevailing economic conditions and occ approval shares may be repurchased occasionally in the open market through privately negotiated transactions utilizing rule 10b51 plans or otherwise 

the bank paid common dividends of 202 million or 104 per share during 2018 compared to 89 million 044 per share during 2017 in february 2019 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 030 per common share payable on february 21 2019 to shareholders of record on february 14 2019 we paid dividends on preferred stock of 34 million during 2018  compared with 40 million during 2017 see note 8  for additional detail about capital management transactions during 2018  

total shareholders’ equity decreased slightly and was 76 billion at december 31 2018  compared with 77 billion at december 31 2017  this decrease was primarily a result of 1 670 million from repurchases of bank common stock 2 236 million from common and preferred dividends paid and 3 111 million from a decrease in the fair value of our afs securities due largely to changes in the interest rate environment these decreases were partially offset by net income of 884 million 

during 2018 and 2017 the market price of our common stock was higher than the exercise price of common stock warrants on our common stock and had a dilutive effect upon earnings per share weighted average diluted shares decreased by 32 million compared with 2017  primarily due to share repurchases partially offset by the dilutive impact of an increased common share price on warrants that have been outstanding since 2008 troubled asset relief program or “tarp” warrants  nasdaq zionz and 2010 nasdaq zionw and employee equity grants during 2018 18 million shares of common stock were issued from the cashless exercise of 58 million zionz common stock warrants which expired on november 14 2018 as of december 31 2018  the bank had 293 million zionw warrants outstanding with an exercise price of 3482  which expire on may 22 2020

basel iii 

in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the rules implemented the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules became effective for the bank on january 1 2015 and were subject to phasein periods for certain of their components in november 2017 the frb fdic and occ published a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain us basel iii capital rules for nonadvanced approaches banks such as the bank effective january 1 2018 the final rule retains the 2017 basel iii transitional treatment of certain dtas and mortgage servicing assets among others a detailed discussion of basel iii requirements including implications for the bank is contained on page 9  in “capital standards – basel framework” under part 1 item 1 in our 2018 annual report on form 10k 

we met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules based upon phasein rules as of december 31 2018 and believe that we would meet all capital adequacy requirements on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective 

capital ratios 

banking organizations are required by capital regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios zions will continue to utilize stress testing as its primary mechanism to inform its decisions on the appropriate level of capital based upon actual and hypotheticallystressed economic conditions the following schedule shows the bank’s capital and performance ratios as of december 31 2018  december 31 2017  and december 31 2016

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the bank’s significant accounting policies discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the bank’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the bank is important to have a complete picture of the bank’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements gaap has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the bank’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than the carrying value of the item being valued considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the bank’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available the bank is required to make judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available the bank uses valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors investment securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of otherthantemporary impairment “otti” otti is considered to have occurred if the instrument’s fair value is below its amortized cost and 1 we intend to sell the security or 2 it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis the “more likely than not” criterion is a lower threshold than the “probable” criterion

allowance for credit losses 

the acl includes the alll and the rulc the alll represents management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses as well as a qualitative review of the results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment and is described in more detail in note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

the rulc provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the alll plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses   as an example if the probability of default risk grade for all passgraded commercial and cre loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal riskgrading scale the quantitatively determined amount of the alll at december 31 2018 would increase by approximately 89 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in risk grades may have on the allowance estimate 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the bank’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the acl we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the acl the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 52   contains further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the acl 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value in the financials of a reporting unit at the time of its acquisition and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this test at the beginning of the fourth quarter annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of our reporting units inclusive of goodwill is less than fair value the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount inclusive of goodwill is more likely than not to exceed its fair value additional quantitative analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any of goodwill impairment our reporting units with goodwill are amegy cbt and zions bank 

to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we historically have used a combination of up to three separate quantitative methods comparable publiclytraded commercial banks in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of commercial banks in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the bank is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the bank’s geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium ranging from 0 to 15 for the reporting units was appropriate 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount estimates include economic conditions which impact the 

zions bancorporation national association and subsidiaries 

assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the bank ’ s regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we performed a full quantitative analysis of the reporting units’ fair value as described above our evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 35 54 and 78 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100 bps the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 33 52 and 72 respectively 

during the fourth quarter of 2018  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation effective october 1 2018  the bank elected to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if the quantitative analysis performed in prior years as described above was required the bank’s qualitative analysis assessed factors related to each reporting unit to determine if it was more likely than not that the carrying value of any reporting unit was greater than the unit’s fair value the qualitative factors considered in our assessment for each reporting unit included 1 economic industry and market conditions 2 regulatory or political developments that could negatively impact operating costs and overall financial performance of any of our specific reporting units and 3 any changes in management key personnel strategy customers and any new or evolving litigation 

none of the factors considered in our qualitative assessment gave any indication that the reporting units’ fair values decreased during the 2018 fiscal year additionally as evidenced in the business segment analysis section of the mda each reporting unit’s key performance metrics remained materially unchanged or improved in 2018 compared to 2017 considering the improved performance of each reporting unit and the lack of any significant concerns being identified in our qualitative assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit continues to be greater than its carry amount making further quantitative impairment testing unnecessary as a result none of our reporting units were subject to goodwill impairment during 2018 or were determined to be atrisk for a potential goodwill impairment in the near future based on information known at this time

the primary factors in competing for business include the quality of service delivered our local community knowledge convenience of office locations online banking functionality and other delivery methods range of products offered and pricing the company must compete effectively along all of these dimensions to remain successful 

supervision and regulation 

this section describes the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the company the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable laws or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the company 

on november 20 2017 we announced a proposal to streamline our corporate structure by merging the parent into its bank subsidiary zb na and in connection with the proposed restructuring our intention to file an application 

with the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” seeking a determination that the resulting banking organization is not systemically important as defined by provisions of the doddfrank act the merger is contingent upon approval by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” and the company’s shareholders assuming the restructuring is completed and the application to fsoc is approved the resulting banking organization would no longer be subject to duplicative examinations and other overlapping regulatory requirements or the enhanced prudential standards established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system under section 165 of the doddfrank act the company’s primarily regulator would be the occ the company would continue to be subject to examinations by the cfpb with respect to consumer financial regulations 

there can be no assurance that the restructuring will be completed or that the fsoc application will be approved accordingly the discussion below is based on the regulatory regime currently applicable to us and our current holding company structure for a description of the material elements of the current regulatory regime applicable to us that would be eliminated if our proposals are successful see “regulatory relief if proposed restructuring is completed and fsoc application is approved” below 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended among other things to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers including both loan customers and depositors and taxpayers these regulations are not however generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors and in fact may have the consequence of reducing returns to our shareholders this regulatory framework has been materially revised and expanded since the 20082009 financial crisis and recession in particular the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated pursuant to it have given financial regulators expanded powers over nearly every aspect of the company’s business these include among other things new higher regulatory capital requirements regulation of dividends and other forms of capital distributions to shareholders through annual stress testing and capital planning processes heightened liquidity and liquidity stress testing requirements which include specific definitions of the types of investment securities that qualify as “highquality liquid assets” and which effectively limit the portion of the company’s balance sheet that can be used to meet the credit needs of its customers specific limitations on mortgage lending products and practices specific limits on certain consumer payment fees and subjecting compensation practices to specific regulatory oversight and restrictions individually and collectively these additional regulations have imposed and will continue to impose higher costs on the company and have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking the majority of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation or clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined recent political developments including the change in the executive administration of the united states have increased uncertainty to the implementation scope and timing of regulatory reforms including those related to the implementation of the doddfrank act the company is committed to both satisfying heightened regulatory expectations and providing attractive shareholder returns however given the stillchanging regulatory environment and such uncertainty the results of these efforts cannot yet be known 

in the first quarter of 2017 the president of the united states issued an executive order identifying “core principles” for the administration’s financial services regulatory policy and directing the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the heads of other financial regulatory agencies to evaluate how the current regulatory framework promotes or inhibits the principles and what actions have been and are being taken to promote the principles in response to the executive order on june 12 2017 october 6 2017 and october 26 2017 respectively the us department of the treasury issued the first three of four reports recommending a number of comprehensive changes in the current regulatory system for us depository institutions the us capital markets and the us asset management and insurance industries these recommendations if implemented could reduce some of the burdens and costs of the current regulatory framework 

general 

the parent is a bank holding company and a financial holding company as provided by the bhc act as modified by the glb act and the doddfrank act these and other federal statutes provide the regulatory framework for 

bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the frb the supervision of zb na and other regulated subsidiaries is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator and the laws and regulations administered by those regulators the glb act allows our subsidiary bank to engage in certain financial activities through financial subsidiaries to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company or to do business through a financial subsidiary the parent and its subsidiary bank must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required 

zb na is subject to the provisions of the national bank act and other statutes governing national banks as well as the rules and regulations of the occ the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” and the fdic it is also subject to examination and supervision by the occ and examination by the cfpb in respect of federal consumer financial regulations in addition zions bancorporation is subject to examination by the federal reserve bank of san francisco some of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the federal reserve board “frb” and other federal and state agencies these regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec financial industry regulatory authority “finra” andor state securities regulators 

the doddfrank act 

the most recent financial crisis led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states implementation of the doddfrank act and related rulemaking activities continued in 2017 

the doddfrank act and regulations adopted under the doddfrank act broadly affect the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities requiring ongoing stress testing of our capital and liquidity mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring divestiture of certain equity investments increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector among other things affecting capital standards the doddfrank act provides that 

 regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act require us to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets than was generally the case before the crisis and limit the forms of capital that we will be able to rely upon for regulatory purposes in addition in its supervisory role with respect to our stress testing and capital planning our ability to deliver returns to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases is subject to prior nonobjection by the frb the stress testing and capital plan processes also could substantially reduce our flexibility to respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and the pricing of certain products and services including the following 

 the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining large financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those 

regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws restricting the scope of federal preemption could burden national banks with the requirement that they also comply with certain state laws covering matters already covered by federal law in addition the doddfrank act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

the doddfrank act contains numerous provisions that limit or place significant burdens and costs on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds for the affected activities these provisions may result in increased compliance and other costs increased legal risk and decreased scope of product offerings and earning assets 

the company is subject to the provisions of the volcker rule issued pursuant to the doddfrank act the company has divested all but 3 million  of private equity investments “peis” not permitted under the volcker rule such investments also provide for 4 million  of potential capital calls which the company would fund as allowed by the volcker rule if and as the capital calls are made until the investments are sold nevertheless because the remaining investments are comprised of funds that are in the later stages of their lifecycle significant future funding requests are not anticipated the company continues to pursue the disposition of all noncompliant peis in february 2017 the federal reserve bank of san francisco approved the company’s application for an extended transition period of up to five years in which to dispose of its remaining peis in light of their illiquid nature 

the company and other companies subject to the doddfrank act are subject to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules these restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act include documentation and governance deferral riskbalancing and clawback requirements any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or engage in other activities or could result in regulatory enforcement actions 

during the second quarter of 2016 the us financial regulators including the frb and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets including zions the proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion such as zions and further more stringent requirements for those with total consolidated assets of at least 250 billion the general qualitative requirements include i prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation ii prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss iii establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward iv requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and v mandating appropriate recordkeeping for larger financial institutions including zions the proposed revised regulations would also introduce very prescriptive requirements relating to the types and percentages the timing of the realization and the risk of forfeiture of incentive compensation awarded to “senior executive officers” and “significant risktakers” the regulators have not yet issued any final rules 

some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation or clarification in 2017 the us house of representatives approved a bill that would significantly amend the postfinancial crisis regulatory framework implemented under the doddfrank act and a bipartisan group of senators also introduced legislation that would revise various postfinancial crisis regulatory requirements and provide targeted relief to certain financial institutions which may include zions if passed this legislative initiative could result in the company no longer being deemed a systemically important financial institution “sifi” or subject to the enhanced prudential supervision standards applicable to sifis the 

likelihood and impact of any regulatory and legislative changes are difficult to predict and cannot be presently determined 

capital standards  basel framework 

in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the basel iii capital rules effectively replaced the basel i capital rules and implemented the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revised the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company compared to the basel i us riskbased capital rules the basel iii capital rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 and were subject to phasein periods for certain of their components in november 2017 the frb fdic and occ published a final rule for nonadvanced approaches banks that extends the regulatory capital treatment applicable during 2017 under the regulatory capital rules for certain items 

the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replaced the riskweighting approach derived from basel i capital accords of the basel committee with a more risksensitive approach based in part on the standardized approach in the basel committee’s 2004 basel ii capital accords the basel iii capital rules also implemented the requirements of section 939a of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules 

the basel iii capital rules among other things i introduced a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” ii specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements iii applied most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and iv expanded the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared to prior regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows 

 when fully phasedin the basel iii capital rules will also require the company and its subsidiary bank to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and progressively increases over time as determined by regulation 

the basel iii capital rules also prescribed a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expanded the riskweighting categories from basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules provided more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increased the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

the basel iii capital rules provided for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets “dtas” dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 the application of this part of the rule did not result in any deductions from cet1 for us 

under prior basel i capital standards the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” items included in capital were excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios as a “nonadvanced approaches banking organization” we made a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items as allowed under the basel iii capital rules 

basel iii also required additional regulatory capital disclosures to be made that are commonly referred to as “pillar 3” disclosures these disclosures require the company to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding its capital structure adequacy and riskweighted assets the company began publishing these pillar 3 disclosures in 2015 and such disclosures are available on the company’s website 

the basel committee has issued a series of updates that propose other changes to capital regulations in one of these the basel committee finalized a revised framework for calculating minimum capital requirements for market risk which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations the basel committee has set an effective date for reporting under the revised framework for market risk capital of december 31 2019 the us federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these revisions for us banking organizations the company met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules as of december 31 2017 

capital planning and stress testing 

the company is required by the doddfrank act to participate in annual stress tests known as the doddfrank act stress test “dfast” and the frb’s horizontal capital review also referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review “hcrccar” the company submitted its 2017 capital plan and stress test results to the frb on april 5 2017 in its capital plan the company was required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios for nine quarters its estimated regulatory capital ratios and its generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” tangible common equity ratio on june 28 2017 we announced that the frb notified us that it did not object to the capital actions outlined in our 2017 capital plan the plan included 1 the increase of the quarterly common dividend to 024 per share by the second quarter of 2018 following the path of 012 per share in the third quarter of 2017 016 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 020 per share in the first quarter of 2018 and 024 per share in the second quarter of 2018 and 2 up to 465 million in total repurchases of common equity 

on june 22 2017 we filed a form 8k with the sec presenting the results of the 2017 dfast the results of the stress test demonstrated that the company has sufficient capital to withstand a severe hypothetical economic downturn detailed disclosure of the stress test results can also be found on our website in addition we submitted on october 5 2017 our midcycle companyrun dfast based upon the company’s june 30 2017 financial position zions’ midcycle dfast results based on the hypothetical severely adverse scenario indicate the company would maintain capital ratios at sufficient levels throughout the ninequarter forecasting horizon as discussed in the midcycle press release published october 5 2017 zions’ hypothetical severely adverse scenario was designed to create a stressful idiosyncratic environment including a 10 unemployment rate and a 35 decline in commercial property values during the ninequarter projection period the minimum cet1 ratio was 99 

zions has participated in the annual hcrccardfast exercise since 2014 prior to 2017 the frb could object to zions’ capital plan on either quantitative or qualitative grounds on january 30 2017 the frb announced a final rule for the 2017 cycle removing from the qualitative assessment of the exercise those bank holding companies that have total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion but less than 250 billion onbalance sheet foreign exposure of less than 10 billion and nonbank assets of less than 75 billion referred to as large and noncomplex “lnc” 

firms however the frb may still object to a capital plan based on the results of its quantitative assessment as an lnc firm zions will still be subject to regular supervisory assessments to examine the company’s capital planning processes our annual capital plan is due by april each year and the frb will publish results of its supervisory hcrccar review of our capital plan by june 30 of each year 

on february 17 2014 the frb published final rules to implement section 165 enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the board of governors and certain bank holding companies  of the doddfrank act the company believes that it is in compliance with these rules 

liquidity 

historically regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter both in the united states and internationally without required formulaic measures however in january 2016 zions became subject to final rules adopted by the frb and other banking regulators “final liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” requirement rule” implementing a us version of the basel committee’s lcr requirement the lcr is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of socalled hqla to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30day stress scenario zions is subject to the modified lcr which is the ratio of an institution’s amount of hqla the numerator over 70 of projected net cash outflows over the 30day horizon the denominator in each case as calculated pursuant to the final lcr rule the final lcr rule requires institutions subject to the modified lcr to maintain the modified ratio equal to at least 100 in order to satisfy this regulatory requirement only specific classes of assets including us treasury securities other us government obligations and agency mortgagebacked securities qualify under the rule as hqla with classes of assets deemed relatively less liquid andor subject to greater degree of credit risk subject to certain haircuts and caps for purposes of calculating the numerator under the final lcr rule the total assumed projected net cash outflows amount is determined under the rule by applying certain hypothetical outflow and inflow rates which reflect certain standardized stressed assumptions against the balances of the banking organization’s funding sources obligations transactions and assets over the 30day stress period inflows that can be included to offset outflows are limited to 75 of outflows which effectively means that banking organizations must hold hqla equal to 25 of outflows even if outflows perfectly match inflows over the stress period 

the basel iii framework also included a second standard referred to as the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may 2016 the frb and other federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the proposed rule the most stringent requirements would apply to bank holding companies with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more in onbalance sheet foreign exposure and would require such organizations to maintain a minimum nsfr of 10 on an ongoing basis calculated by dividing the organization’s available stable funding by its required stable funding bank holding companies with less than 250 billion but more than 50 billion in total consolidated assets and less than 10 billion in onbalance sheet foreign exposure such as zions would be subject to a modified nsfr requirement which would require such bank holding companies to maintain a minimum nsfr of 07 on an ongoing basis under the proposed rule a banking organization’s available stable funding would be calculated by applying specified standard weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability over a oneyear time horizon and its required stable funding would be calculated by applying specified standardized weightings to its assets derivative exposures and commitments based on their liquidity characteristics over the same oneyear time horizon the us federal bank regulatory agencies have not released the final rule we do not expect this to have a material impact on the company 

financial privacy and cyber security 

the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may 

also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addressed five categories of cyber standards 1 cyber risk governance 2 cyber risk management 3 internal dependency management 4 external dependency management and 5 incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness the comment period expired in february 2017 however the regulators have not yet issued any revised proposed rules or final rules 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia as modified by the basel iii capital rules an insured depository institution generally will be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its cet1 ratio is under 3 its total riskbased capital ratio is less than 8 its tier 1 riskbased capital ratio is less than 6 or its tier 1 leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan 

other regulations 

the company is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 



stress test and capital plan to which the frb has not objected see discussion under “liquidity management actions” on page 74  

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive 

compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has overseen management’s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk practices this system includes policies and guidelines such as corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of company stock by insiders and charters for the audit risk oversight compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 

regulatory relief if proposed restructuring is completed and fsoc application is approved 

as discussed above on november 20 2017 we announced a proposal to streamline our corporate structure by merging the parent into its bank subsidiary zb na in connection with the proposed restructuring we also intend to file an application with fsoc the “fsoc appeal” that if successful could potentially eliminate “enhanced” regulation of the “company” as a sifi 

if completed the proposed restructuring would eliminate the bank holding company structure and associated regulatory framework and would result in zb na becoming the toplevel publiclytraded entity within our corporate structure if the proposed restructuring and fsoc appeal are successful the company expects that 



heightened standards for national banks with assets of 50 billion or more and the dfast process as described above under “capital planning and stress testing” 

 in addition if the restructuring is completed the company generally would no longer be subject to the securities law of 1933 but would remain subject to the requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 including the reporting requirements thereunder however the company would be subject to occ regulations governing securities offerings and make any filings required under the securities exchange act with the occ instead of the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s growth strategy is driven by key factors while adhering to defined risk parameters the key elements of zions’ strategy reflect its prudent risktaking philosophy the company generates revenue by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks these factors are outlined in the company’s risk appetite framework 

the company’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee of the board approved an enterprise risk management framework and appointed an enterprise risk management committee “ermc” to oversee and implement the framework the ermc is comprised of senior management of the company and is chaired by the chief risk officer the company’s most significant risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in prudent extension of credit to relationship customers in addition to credit risk these committees also monitor the following level one risk areas market and interest rate risk liquidity risk strategicbusiness risk operationaltechnology risk model risk capitalfinancial reporting risk legalcompliance risk including regulatory risk and reputational risk as outlined in the company’s risk taxonomy in 2017 the company also designated cyber risk a level one risk in its risk taxonomy which places it at the highest level of oversight with its other top risks additional governance and oversight includes boardapproved policies and management committees with direct focus on these specific risk categories incorporated into each of these level one risks mentioned previously is third party vendor risk which the company views as critical in the management and oversight of vendor management 

although not comprehensive the following describes several risk factors that are significant to the company 

credit risk 

credit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks a decline in the strength of the us economy in general or the local economies in which we conduct operations could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses “alll” 

we have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio including loans secured by real estate leveraged and enterprise value lending and oil and gasrelated lending which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results while oil and gas prices have stabilized over the last year and our lending exposure to this segment has been reduced the oil and gas industry is still subject to volatility 

concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the company concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the company due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk 

we engage in commercial construction and land acquisition and development lending as well as commercial term lending primarily in our western states footprint the company as a whole has relatively larger concentrations of such lending than many other peer institutions in addition we have a concentration in oil and gasrelated lending primarily in texas both commercial real estate “cre” and oil and gasrelated lending are subject to specific 

risks including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateralvalues and activity levels in addition our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states and values there may behave differently than in other parts of the united states we may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the united states 

as a regional bank holding company the company provides a full range of banking and related services through its local management teams and unique brands in arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah washington and wyoming approximately 76 of the company’s total net interest income relates to our banking operations in utah texas and california for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively as a result of this geographic concentration our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results for example our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events at december 31 2017  loan balances associated with our banking operations in utah texas and california comprised 80 of the company’s commercial lending portfolio 74 of the cre lending portfolio and 71 of the consumer lending portfolio 

loans originated by our banking operations in utah texas and california are primarily to borrowers in those respective states with the exception of the national real estate group which cooriginates or purchases primarily owneroccupied firstlien cre loans from financial institutions throughout the country 

we have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

adverse economic conditions negatively affect the company’s assets including its loan and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition the most recent financial crisis resulted in significant regulatory changes that continue to affect the company although economic conditions have improved since the most recent financial crisis it is possible that economic conditions may weaken economic and fiscal conditions in the united states and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic and market conditions faced by the company and its customers any sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions would adversely affect the company 

market and interest rate risks 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability management committee which is established by the company’s board of directors failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect the company factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

the company remains in an “assetsensitive” interest rate risk position which means that net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates increase and to decline if interest rates decrease most recently the frb decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 125 to 15 and indicated that it will determine the timing and size of future rate adjustments by assessing realized and expected economic conditions relative to the objectives of maximum employment and 2 inflation 

financial market participants have recently contemplated the possibility of negative interest rates with the exception of brief money market disruptions in which some us treasury bills traded at negative rates the us has 

not previously experienced a negative rate environment although other developed economies have had prolonged periods of negative rates therefore there are many unknown factors which could impact the company in a negative rate environment the ability to effectively charge customers interest on deposits will be determined largely by competition for deposits but the company’s deposit systems may require modification to allow for negative deposit rates asset allocation strategies would be reconsidered were the frb to charge for excess reserves 

our estimates of our interest rate risk position related to noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on assumptions for which there is little historical experience and the actual behavior of those deposits in a changing interest rate environment may differ materially from our estimates which could materially affect our results of operations 

we have experienced a low interest rate environment for the past several years our views with respect to among other things the degree to which we are “assetsensitive” including our interest rate risk position for noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on modeled projections that rely on assumptions regarding changes in balances of such deposits in a changing interest rate environment because there is no modern precedent for the prolonged extremely low interest rate environment that has prevailed for the last several years there is little historical experience upon which to base such assumptions if interest rates continue to increase our assumptions regarding changes in balances of noninterestbearing demand deposits and regarding the speed and degree to which other deposits are repriced may prove to be incorrect and business decisions made in reliance on our modeled projections and underlying assumptions could prove to be unsuccessful because noninterestbearing demand deposits are a significant portion of our deposit base realized results which are different from our modeled projections and the underlying assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

liquidity risk 

as a regulated entity we are subject to capital and liquidity requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth 

we are a bank holding company and as such we and our subsidiary bank are subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the frb the occ and the fdic including riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements and basel iii liquidity requirements capital needs may rise above normal levels when we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition risk profile and growth plans in addition we may be required to increase our capital levels even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts as a result of stress testing and capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios compliance with the capital requirements including leverage ratios may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels for a summary of the capital rules to which we are subject see “capital standards – basel framework” on page 10  of this annual report on form 10k 

liquidity regulations including regulations establishing a minimum liquidity coverage ratio and requiring monthly liquidity stress testing applicable to the company may impact profitability 

the company is subject to liquidity regulations including a requirement that it conduct monthly liquidity stress tests that require it to maintain a modified lcr of at least 100 the company’s calculation of the modified lcr indicates that the company is in compliance with the requirement such stress testing is subject to ongoing model and assumptions changes which could affect results 

in order to meet the requirements of these new regulations the company expects to continue to hold a higher portion of its assets in hqla and a lower portion of its assets in loans than was generally the case prior to such regulation hqla generally have lower yields than loans of the type made by the company 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us and particular classes of securities that we and our banking subsidiary 

issue the rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies ratings downgrades to us or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

strategicbusiness risks 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us information security and vendor management processes are in place to actively identify manage and monitor actual and potential impacts 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

we have made and are continuing to make significant changes to the company that include among other things organizational restructurings efficiency initiatives and replacement or upgrades of certain core technological systems to improve our control environment and operating efficiency the ultimate success and completion of these changes and their effect on the company may vary significantly from initial planning which could materially adversely affect the company 

over the last several years the company has completed numerous improvement projects including combining the legal charters of our seven affiliate banks into one consolidating 15 loan operations sites into two upgrading our accounting systems installing a credit origination work flow system streamlining our small business and retail lending mortgage wealth management and foreign exchange businesses and investing in data quality and information security ongoing investment continues in a multiyear project to replace our core loan and deposit systems a collection of customerfacing digital capabilities and a variety of other projects to simplify how we do business 

these changes continue to be implemented some of the projects are fully completed and some projects are in their early stages by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings expected efficiencies and related items are subject to change and significant variability 

we may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these changes these may include significant time delays cost overruns loss of key people technological problems processing failures and other adverse developments any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems processes control environment procedures and employees which may adversely impact our customers and our ability to conduct business 

we have plans policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these potential adverse developments however there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately remediated the ultimate effect of any adverse development could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect the company including its control environment operating efficiency and results of operations 

operationaltechnology risks 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and the company 

the company has significant operations and a significant customer base in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy the company’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to the company’s property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the company’s customers and in turn on the company although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations these efforts also include the management of controls to mitigate operational risks for programs and processes across the company 

we could be adversely affected by financial technology advancements and other nontraditional lending and banking sources 

the ability to successfully remain competitive is dependent upon our ability to maintain a critical technological capability and to identify and develop new valueadded products for existing and future customers failure to do so could impede our time to market reduce customer product accessibility and weaken our competitive position 

cyber risk 

we are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations information security risks for large financial institutions such as zions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of cyber criminals any failure interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems misappropriation of funds and theft disclosure or misuse of proprietary company or customer data while we have significant internal resources policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

model risk 

we increasingly use models in the management of the company and in particular in the required stress testing and capital plan there is risk that these models are incorrect or inaccurate in various ways which can cause us 

to make nonoptimal decisions and this risk causes the company to hold additional capital as a buffer against that risk 

we attempt to carefully develop document back test and validate the models used in the management of the company including for example models used in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk and those used in projecting stress losses in various segments of our credit and securities portfolios and projecting net revenue under stress models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons however and cannot perfectly predict outcomes management decisions based in part on such models therefore can be suboptimal in addition in determining the company’s capital needs under stress testing we attempt to specifically quantify the amounts by which model results could be incorrect and we hold material additional amounts of capital as a buffer against this “model risk” 

capitalfinancial reporting risks 

stress testing and capital management under the doddfrank act may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

under hcrccar we are required to submit to the frb each year our capital plan for the applicable planning horizon along with the results of required stress tests each annual capital plan will among other things specify our planned capital actions with respect to dividends preferred stock redemptions common stock repurchases or issuances and similar matters and will be subject to the objection or nonobjection by the frb moreover the hcrccar process requires us to analyze the pro forma impact on our financial condition of various hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios selected by us and the frb we must maintain or raise capital sufficient to meet our risk management and regulatory expectations under such hypothetical scenarios in connection with the annual hcrccar process we also participate in the dfast on a semiannual basis under dfast a standardized strategy for capital actions dividend payments held constant and other current capital obligations met is implemented by all participating banks as required by the doddfrank act we also submit stress tests to the occ for our subsidiary bank because it has assets in excess of 10 billion under both hcrccar and dfast the frb uses its proprietary models to analyze the company’s stressed capital position the severity of the hypothetical scenarios devised by the frb and occ and employed in these stress tests is undefined by law or regulation and is thus subject solely to the discretion of the regulators the stress testing and capital planning processes may among other things require us to increase our capital levels limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under stress testing and capital management standards implemented by bank regulatory agencies under the doddfrank act we may declare dividends repurchase common stock redeem preferred stock and debt access capital markets for certain types of capital make acquisitions and enter into similar transactions only if included in a capital plan to which the frb has not objected any similar transactions not contemplated in our annual capital plan other than those with an inconsequential impact on actual or projected capital may require a new stress test and capital plan which is subject to frb nonobjection these requirements may significantly limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

the company and its subsidiary bank must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by its banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios and the particular conditions risk profiles and growth plans of the company and its subsidiary bank compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require the company or its subsidiaries to raise additional capital or may require additional capital investment from the parent these uncertainties and risks including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties may increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the company provides to its customers invests in and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex 

financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the company to comply before their formal adoption therefore identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk 

our results of operations depend upon the performance of our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our banking subsidiary and other subsidiaries the parent receives substantially all of its revenues from dividends from its subsidiaries and primarily from its subsidiary bank these dividends are a principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt we and certain of our subsidiaries experienced periods of unprofitability or reduced profitability during the most recent recession of 20072009 the ability of the company and its subsidiary bank to pay dividends is restricted by regulatory requirements including profitability and the need to maintain required levels of capital lack of profitability or reduced profitability exposes us to the risk that regulators could restrict the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends it also increases the risk that the company may have to establish a “valuation allowance” against its net dta or have that asset disallowed for regulatory capital purposes 

the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends or make other payments to us is also limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general regulatory restrictions on its dividends if it does not satisfy these regulatory requirements we may be unable to pay dividends or interest on our indebtedness the occ the primary regulator of our subsidiary bank has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks to pay dividends only out of current earnings in addition if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which could include the payment of dividends such authority may take actions requiring that such bank refrain from the practice payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if a subsidiary bank were to become “undercapitalized” for purposes of the applicable federal regulatory “prompt corrective action” regulations 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

as of december 31 2017  the company had 1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to amegy cbt and zions bank if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value the company may have to take a charge related to the impairment of its goodwill such a charge would occur if the company were to experience increases in the book value of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in the fair value of equity of a reporting unit a significant decline in the company’s expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the company’s common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein may necessitate the company taking charges in the future related to the impairment of its goodwill future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of the appropriateness of the goodwill carrying value if the company was to conclude that a future writedown of its goodwill is necessary it would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company may not be able to utilize the significant dta recorded on its balance sheet 

the company’s balance sheet includes a significant dta we had net dtas of 93 million at december 31 2017  compared with 250 million at december 31 2016  the largest components of this asset result from additions to our alll for purposes of gaap in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes our ability to continue to record this dta is dependent on the company’s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital in addition inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations currently no dtas are disallowed for regulatory purposes either on a consolidated basis or at the company’s subsidiary bank 

legalcompliance risks 

the doddfrank act imposes significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank act has material implications for the company and the entire financial services industry the doddfrank act places significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions particularly those with more than 50 billion of assets including the company in addition among other things the doddfrank act 

 the company and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel systems consulting and other costs in order to comply with new regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act particularly with respect to stress testing and risk management some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation and clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined individually and collectively regulations adopted under the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the company’s and the financial services industry’s business financial condition including the company’s ability to compete effectively with less regulated financial services providers and results of operations 

other legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and earnings 

in addition to the doddfrank act described previously bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and accordingly we are subject to fdic insurance assessments   

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted however if adopted some of these proposals could adversely affect the company by among other things impacting aftertax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting the company’s ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of the company’s funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that the company could offer and requiring the company to raise capital at inopportune times 

recent political developments including the change in the executive administration of the united states could result in substantial changes in tax international trade immigration and other policies the extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain as are the potential direct and indirect impacts whether beneficial or adverse 

regulations and laws may be modified or repealed and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be adopted 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings the company’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and increasingly aggressive enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations any   such   matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties including civil money penalties under applicable banking laws injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations including those relating to antimoney laundering matters have been increasing dramatically in addition any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings which may restrict or limit our activities 

reputational risk

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities although nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under gaap 

the following are the nongaap financial measures presented in this form 10k and a discussion of why management uses these nongaap measures 

return on average tangible common equity  – this schedule also includes “net earnings applicable to common shareholders excluding the effects of the adjustments net of tax” and “average tangible common equity” return on average tangible common equity is a nongaap financial measure that management believes provides useful information about the company’s use of shareholders’ equity management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and its subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 66 billion  financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah 



engaged in community events and charitable efforts designed to give back to the people within our communities in 2017 we believe this local customized approach led to a strong showing with commercial customers as reflected in the greenwich awards referenced earlier as well as a growth rate of loans that exceeded the domestic commercial banks’ rate by approximately three percentage points 



excess capital informed primarily by our stress test results and have indicated that we intend to increase the leverage of the company at a gradual pace as a result of moderate loan growth combined with total payout ratios generally similar to the current capital plan 

 results of operations 

executive summary 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2017  of 550 million  or 260  per diluted common share compared with 411 million  or 199  per diluted common share for 2016  the improved financial performance reflects revenue growth continued expense control and improved credit quality particularly in the oil and gasrelated loan portfolio net income increased in 2017  primarily due to a 198 million  increase in net interest income from growth in our lending and securities portfolios during the year and shortterm rate increases that positively impacted loan yields revenue also experienced a benefit from a 28 million increase related to noninterest income and credit costs specifically the provision for loan losses declined 69 million these increases were partially offset by a 64 million increase in noninterest expense 

performance relative to previously announced initiatives 

efficiency initiatives 

in june 2015 we announced several initiatives to improve operational and financial performance along with some key financial targets our initiatives are designed to improve customer experience to simplify the corporate structure and operations and to make the company a more efficient organization following is a brief discussion regarding our performance against these key financial targets 



 highlights in 2017   

net interest income which is more than threequarters of our revenue improved by 198 million  to 21 billion  compared with 2016  the average balance of our investment securities portfolio grew 54 billion  and the average rate on those securities expanded 9 bps due in part to a change in asset mix our average lending portfolio also grew by 3  or 14 billion  the average yield on the loan portfolio increased 14 bps reflecting in part several increases in shortterm benchmark rates although there was a decrease in the average balance of longterm debt in 2017 of 286 million this was offset by increased average federal home loan bank “fhlb” and other shortterm borrowings which rose by 36 billion interest expense increased 40 million  compared with 2016 almost entirely driven by the increase in wholesale funding interest expense on deposits increased only 10 million on more than 52 billion of average deposits some of the same factors that led to an increase in net interest income also resulted in net interest margin “nim” expansion in 2017 relative to 2016 which was 345  and 337  respectively 

adjusted ppnr of 992 million  in 2017 was up 172 million from 2016 this increase reflects operating leverage improvement resulting from loan growth and a more profitable average earning assets mix adjusted noninterest expense increased to 1640 billion  or 1628 billion if excluding the charitable foundation contribution related to the tax cuts and jobs act from 1579 billion  in 2017 however this was more than offset by improved revenue ppnr improvements during 2017 have driven an improvement in the company’s efficiency ratio from 658  in 2016 to 623  in 2017 

our lending portfolio grew 21 billion  based on yearend balances or 5  during 2017 we have seen widespread growth across most products and geographies with particular strength in 14 family residential commercial and industrial and municipal lending we saw a small decline in our national real estate “nre” portfolio and we actively managed decreases in our oil and gasrelated and cre term portfolios we are currently comfortable with the concentrations in both the oil and gasrelated and cre term portfolios and we do not expect the attrition trend to continue 

asset quality has been very favorable during 2017 credit quality in the oil and gasrelated portfolio continues to strengthen and it has remained strong in the rest of the lending portfolio overall criticized classified and nonaccrual loans declined by 292 million 444 million and 127 million respectively 

we continue to increase the return on and ofcapital as previously mentioned the company’s return on average tangible common equity increased substantially in 2017 relative to 2016 regarding return of capital during the year the company repurchased 7 million shares of common stock for 320 million dividends per common share were 044 in 2017 up from 028 in 2016 in june 2017 we announced that the federal reserve did not object to the capital actions in the company’s 2017 capital plan the binding portion of which spans the timeframe of july 2017 to june 2018 the plan included stepped quarterly common dividend increases rising to 024 per share by the second quarter of 2018 and up to 465 million in common stock repurchases see “capital management” on page 77  for more information regarding the 2018 capital plan 

we announced in 2013 that we had started a project to replace our core loan and deposit banking systems “core transformation project” we successfully implemented the first phase of the tcs bαncs ®  core servicing system in mid2017 replacing our consumer lending system the second phase is focused on the replacement of our commercial and construction lending systems is expected to be completed in 2019 the replacement of the deposit system is the third phase of the project as of december 31 2017 the company had 148 million of capitalized expenses associated with the core transformation project bαncs ®  is a real time parameterdriven servicing system that will provide longterm benefits to the company by improving accessibility and functionality allowing our bankers to better serve customers 

areas experiencing challenges in 2017   

noninterest income from customerrelated fees increased approximately 3  in 2017 from the prior year period which was less than the targeted growth goal we experienced strength in card activity credit debit merchant growth in the company’s trust and wealth management initiatives and increased foreign currency and derivative transactions made on behalf of customers this growth was partially offset by a decline in loan sales and servicing income which was mainly due to fewer sales of residential mortgages and a lower valuation adjustment on our agricultural loan servicing assets accounted for at fair value we are targeting midsingle digit growth of customerrelated fee income 

noninterest expense increased to 1649 billion  from 1585 billion  in 2016 equivalent to a 4  increase adjusting for the onetime charitable contribution mentioned earlier adjusted noninterest expense increased 3 which is in line with announced forecasts employee costs including salaries and benefits expenses were higher in 2017 than in the prior year partially due to a combination of higher incentive compensation and increased costs in the company’s benefit plans depreciation and amortization expense was higher by 5 million in part because we placed into use a newly constructed office building at our amegy affiliate and as previously mentioned we successfully implemented the first phase of our core transformation project fdic premiums increased 13 million over the prior year due in part to a surcharge assessed to large banks introduced by the fdic in the third quarter of 2016 with the purpose of recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund 

areas of focus for 2018 

in 2018 we are focused on the ongoing initiatives related to company profitability and returns on equity major areas of emphasis include the following 



schedule 4   

key drivers of performance 

2017  compared to 2016 



1 includes the following income statement line items service charges and fees on deposit accounts other service charges commissions and fees wealth management and trust income capital markets and foreign exchange and loan sales and servicing income 

2 includes loans held for sale 

net interest income 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest portion of our revenue for 2017  taxableequivalent net interest income was 21 billion  compared with 19 billion  and 17 billion  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35  for all years presented the increase over 2016 and the previous increase over 2015 were driven by several factors including a larger average securities portfolio balance loan growth and increases in benchmark interest rates that impacted loan yields we expect the size of the securities portfolio to be relatively stable during the next several quarters and we are not assuming any further increases in benchmark rates in our forecasts therefore we expect net interest income to increase at a moderate pace in 2018 when compared with 2017 

net interest margin and interest rate spreads in 2017  vs 2016 

the nim was 345  and 337  for 2017  and 2016  respectively compared with 2016 changes in asset mix resulted in higher securities and loan balances lower balances in money market investments and higher balances of wholesale borrowings to fund overall balance sheet growth moving funds from money market investments to loans and securities had a positive impact on nim while funding balance sheet growth with wholesale borrowings reduced spreads and negatively impacted nim although it was accretive to net interest income the nim was also positively impacted by several increases in shortterm interest rates average interestearning assets increased 47 billion from 2016 with average rates improving 14 bps average interestbearing liabilities increased 36 billion and average rates increased 8 bps over the same period 

the average loan portfolio increased 14 billion or 3 from 2016 with the majority of growth coming from 14 family residential commercial and industrial and municipal lending yields on average balances increased overall buoyed by increases of 16 bps and 26 bps in the commercial and cre portfolios respectively yields on average 

consumer balances were relatively flat during 2017 much of the consumer growth was in consumer 14 family residential where our yields are generally lower than on commercial loans benchmark interest rates increased several times beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 which has had a positive impact on nim and spreads as our earning assets generally reprice more quickly than our funding sources a portion of our variablerate loans were not affected by these changes primarily due to longer reset frequency or because a substantial portion of our earning assets are tied to longerterm rates indices which rates were impacted by a relatively flat yield curve for much of 2017 additionally nim benefited from fdicsupported loans by approximately 3 bps and 4 bps in 2017 and 2016 respectively we expect continued strong growth in residential mortgages with moderate growth in both cre and commercial and industrial loans 

average availableforsale “afs” securities balances increased 54 billion during 2017 and yields were also up 17 bps due to the effect of rising interest rates on variablerate securities moderation in the amount of prepayments on agencyguaranteed mortgagebacked securities and investment in products providing a higher yield than the average portfolio   the purchases were funded by using loweryielding average money market investments which were reduced by 21 billion and wholesale bo rrowing from the fhlb the investment portfolio has now reached a generally appropriate size relative to the balance sheet 

average noni nterestbearing demand deposits provided us with lowcost funding and comprised   456   of average total deposits which totaled   522 billion   in 2017 compared with   444   of average total deposits which totaled   506 billion  for 2016 average interestbearing deposits increased only   1   in 2017 compared with 2 016 over the past 12 months the federal reserve has increased the overnight benchmark federal funds rate by 75 bps while the rate paid on the company’s interestbearing deposits increased 3 bps we have been selectively increasing deposit pricing in certain markets and with certain clients but we have not generally experienced signific 

ant pressure to broadly increase deposit rates although we consider a wide variety of sources when determining our fu nding needs we benefit from access to deposits from a significant number of small to midsized business customers which provide us with a low cost of funds and have a positive impact on our nim including wholesale borrowings the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased 8 bps primarily due to borrowings increasing as a percentage of liabilities during 2017 

the average balance of longterm debt decreased   286 million   compared with 2016 and although the average rate increased 61 bps in the current year because remaining debt was at a higher average rate than the rate on debt that matured and was available to be called overall interest expense thereon decreased   13 million  as mentioned previously the company has used shortterm fhlb borrowings to fund some of its balance sheet growth average shortterm debt grew   36 billion   and the rate paid increased 78 bps  further changes in shortterm borrowings will be driven by balancing changes in deposits and loans as we do not foresee significant increases in investment security balances 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 327  and 323  for 2017 and 2016 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim 

we expect the mix of interestearning assets to continue to change over the next several quarters due to solid consumer loan growth accompanied by moderate growth in cre term loans and nonoil and gasrelated commercial and industrial loans we anticipate this growth will be partially offset by continued modest reduction in the nre portfolio 

interest rate spreads and margin are impacted by the mix of assets we hold the composition of our loan and securities portfolios and the type of funding used assuming no additional increases in the federal funds rate we expect the yield on the securities portfolio to increase slightly as the cash flow from the portfolio is redeployed into securities with yields that are slightly accretive to the overall portfolio we expect the yield of the loan portfolio to increase somewhat due to the effects of rising interest rates in late 2017 partially offset by a continued modest change in the mix of the portfolio increasing concentration in loweryielding residential mortgages as well as reduced income from higheryielding loans purchased from the fdic in 2009 

our estimates of the company’s interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes in addition our modeled projections for noninterestbearing demand deposits which are a substantial portion of our deposit balances are particularly reliant on assumptions for which there is little historical experience due to the prolonged period of very low interest rates further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate and market risk management” on page 68  

refer to the “liquidity risk management” section beginning on page 72  for more information on how we manage liquidity risk 

net interest margin and interest rate spreads in 2016 vs 2015 

the nim was   337   and   319   for 2016 and 2015 respectively market  trends and competitive pricing led to generally flat or lower yields across loans and investments in 2016 compared with 2015 these yield adjustments were offset by changes in the company’s asset mix which in 2016 became less concentrated in loweryielding money market investments and more focused on higheryielding agency securities and loans further contributing to the improvement was a decline in the company’s cost of funds due to higher amounts of noninterestbearing deposits and tender offers early calls and maturities of higherrate debt including the remaining trust preferred securities 

average interestearning assets increased 18 billion from 2015 with rates improving 12 bps average interestbearing liabilities increased 769 million and rates decreased 11 bps over the same period 

our average loan portfolio was 19 billion higher during 2016  compared with 2015 although the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio was 8 bps lower than it was in 2015 due to competitive pricing pressure and depressed interest rates the larger average loan base generated an additional 45 million of taxableequivalent interest income during the year the largest average growth in 2016 was in the cre portfolio which also saw the average yield decline by 22 bps the decline in loan yields occurred as new loans were originated or existing loans reset or were modified see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 68  for further information regarding our interest rate sensitivity 

during 2016 we continued to purchase us agency passthrough securities in order to alter the mix of our interestearning assets that began in the second half of 2014 the average balance of afs securities for 2016 increased by 44 billion or 84 compared with 2015 and the average yield was flat at 193 average balances of money market investments over the same period declined 46 billion with an average yield during 2016 of 059 this asset movement had the largest impact on the improvement in nim during 2016 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided us with low cost funding and comprised 444  of average total deposits for 2016 compared with 439  for 2015 average interestbearing deposit balances increased by 3 in 2016 compared with 2015 additionally the rate paid was flat at 18 bps 

the average balance of longterm debt was 313 million lower for 2016 compared with 2015 the reduced balance was the result of tender offers early calls and maturities the average interest rate on longterm debt for 2016 decreased by 157 bps compared with 2015 this was due to the maturity of higher cost longterm debt in the latter part of 2015 which had a greater impact on the average rate during 2016 

the lower cost of funds in 2016 compared with 2015 and improved yields on average interestearning assets contributed to the higher nim and to an improvement in spread from 299  in 2015 to 323  in 2016 

the following schedule summarizes the average balances the amount of interest earned or incurred and the applicable yields for interestearning assets and the costs of interestbearing liabilities that generate taxableequivalent net interest income

schedule 6  analyzes the yeartoyear changes in net interest income on a fully taxableequivalent basis for the years indicated for purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans however interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions in addition interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates

in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate changes due to the volumerate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate both increase the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate when the rate increases and volume decreases the variance is allocated to rate 

provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the alll at an adequate level based on the inherent risks in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments “rulc” at an adequate level based on the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the alll and rulc we perform periodic evaluations of our various loan portfolios the levels of actual charge 

offs credit trends and external factors see note 6   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 56  for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

the provision for loan losses was 24 million  in 2017 compared with 93 million  in 2016 credit quality was strong throughout 2017 with significant improvement in the oil and gasrelated portfolio classified and nonaccrual loans in the total portfolio declined by 444 million and 127 million respectively net chargeoffs totaled 73 million in 2017 compared with 132 million in the prior year these improvements in both credit quality and net chargeoffs resulted in the lower provision the company has roughly 8 billion of loan balances in the geographic area impacted by hurricane harvey during the third quarter of 2017 we added a qualitative allowance of 34 million based on multiple topdown and bottomup analyses to estimate potential losses during the fourth quarter subsequent analysis indicated our losses may not be as large as we first believed and we released roughly onethird of the associated allowance 

the provision for unfunded lending commitments was 7 million  in 2017 compared with 10 million  in 2016 the negative provision in 2016 was primarily due to improved credit quality assessments related to these obligations for credits outside the oil and gasrelated portfolio along with declining oil and gasrelated exposure in 2017 improved credit quality especially in the oil and gasrelated portfolio resulted in a further release of the rulc from quarter to quarter the provision for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations fundings and changes in credit quality 

the allowance for credit losses “acl” which is the combination of both the alll and the rulc decreased by 56 million during 2017 even with loan growth and the abovementioned hurricane impact strong credit quality and decreased net chargeoffs in the total loan portfolio were responsible for much of this reduction further declining oil and gasrelated exposure and increasing nonoil and gasrelated commercial and industrial and 14 family residential mortgage exposure improved the risk profile of the portfolio 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield for 2017  noninterest income was 544 million  compared with 516 million  in 2016  and 357 million  in 2015  we believe a subtotal of customerrelated fees provides a better view of income over which we have more direct control it excludes items such as dividends insurancerelated income marktomarket adjustments on certain derivatives and securities gains and losses 

schedule 7  presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

schedule 7   

noninterest income 



other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of atm fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit and credit card interchange fees cash management fees and other miscellaneous fees increased by 9 million  compared with 2016 the increase relates mainly to higher credit card interchange fees and exchange and other fees in 2016 other service charges commissions and fees increased by 21 million compared with 2015 the increase was primarily a result of the same items mentioned previously as well as fees generated on sales of interest rate swaps to clients 

during the first quarter of 2016 we reclassified bankcard rewards expense from noninterest expense into noninterest income in order to offset the associated revenue from interchange fees to align with industry practice this reclassification within other service charges commission and fees lowered noninterest income in the first quarter of 2016 and also decreased other noninterest expense by the same amount for comparative purposes we also reclassified prior period amounts this reclassification had no impact on net income 

wealth management and trust income increased by 5 million  the change was due to trust income with improvement in both corporate and personal trust revenue due to platform and product simplifications wealth management and trust income increased 6 million between 2016 and 2015 for the same reasons 

dividends and other investment income increased 16 million  primarily due to 14 million of gains across many of our cost and equity method investments after consolidating seven banking charters into one in december 2015 our stock ownership with the fhlb system has decreased significantly and dividends thereon have also fallen due to increased use of fhlb borrowing during 2017 the company has purchased fhlb activity stock as needed however the dividends received have not equaled the level seen prior to 2016 the consolidation also caused an increase in the company’s ownership of federal reserve stock dividends on frb stock were relatively flat between 2017 and 2016 

loan sales and servicing income decreased 10 million  in 2017 compared with 2016 during 2017 we ceased selling servicingreleased mortgage loans to freddie mac and therefore no longer received the associated servicing premiums for doing so which decreased income by 11 million in general servicing income increased slightly in 2017 we also had particularly large valuation gains during 2016 on agricultural loan servicing assets accounted for at fair value which did not repeat to the same extent in the current year loan sales and servicing income increased 4 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due mainly to these valuation gains on servicing assets 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense increased by 64 million  or 4  to 1649 million  in 2017  compared with 1585 million  in 2016  and 1581 million  in 2015  excluding the effect of a charitable foundation contribution of 12 million related to the tax cuts and jobs act noninterest expense increased in line with communicated forecasts the company remains focused on expense control efforts while we continue to invest in our technology initiatives employee expenses were up partially due to a combination of higher incentive compensation in 2017 as a result of improved company performance and increased costs in the company’s benefit plans expenses increased only 4 million between 2016 and 2015 with few major fluctuations in any category 

schedule 8  presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

schedule 8   

noninterest expense 



salaries and employee benefits increased by 28 million  or 3  in 2017 compared with 2016 as illustrated in schedule 9  base salaries were up in 2017 as employee salary expense rose roughly in line with inflation employee bonuses were up partially due to lower incentive compensation for management in 2016 and larger commission expense in the current year benefits expense increased 9 million  or 6  in 2017 primarily due to higher costs in the company’s selffunded medical plans and an increase in profit sharing expense salaries and employee benefits increased by 10 million or 1 in 2016 compared with 2015 due to several reasons our investment in major systems projects led to headcount increases in more highly compensated roles we had higher costs in our medical plans and also higherthanexpected retirement expense due to several large lumpsum payouts during the year 

schedule 9   

salaries and employee benefits 



occupancy expense was up 4 million  in 2017 we placed a newly constructed office building into operation during the first quarter and depreciation expense was consequently higher than in 2016 rental income was higher in the current year because we are leasing space to tenants but other costs surrounding the building implementation offset this benefit expense increased 5 million or 4 in 2016 compared with 2015 the increase was due to a combination of small items including higher rent expense lease depreciation and building security 

during 2017 we successfully implemented the first release of the tcs bαncs ®  core servicing system furniture and equipment expense increased 5 million in 2017 mainly due to amortization of capitalized software expense was relatively flat between 2016 and 2015 

fdic premiums were 53 million  40 million  and 34 million  in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively increases were due to higher deposit bases in each of the years and the fdic’s increase in deposit insurance assessments that occurred in the third quarter of 2016 these increases were somewhat offset by a reduction in the company’s overall rate resulting from the consolidation of the individual bank charters and the bank’s lower risk profile 

other noninterest expense was 223 million  in 2017 compared with 213 million  in 2016 and 225 million  in 2015 the increase in 2017 was mainly due to the onetime charitable contribution made at the end of the year the main driver for lower expense in 2016 compared with 2015 was lower levels of legal related expense 

in 2016 we held adjusted noninterest expense below 158 billion and expected an increase of between 2 and 3 in 2017 excluding the impact of the previously discussed onetime charitable contribution of 12 million the actual increase in adjusted noninterest expense was 3 which was in line with our forecast the expense items we exclude from noninterest expense to arrive at adjusted noninterest expense are the same as those excluded in arriving at the efficiency ratio see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 29  for more information regarding the calculation of the efficiency ratio 

income taxes 

income tax expense was 344 million  in 2017  236 million  in 2016  and 142 million  in 2015  our effective income tax rates including the effects of noncontrolling interests were 368 in 2017  335 in 2016  and 315 in 2015  the tax expense rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance the tax rate in 2017 was further impacted by the following items 

 further the tax rate in 2015 decreased significantly as a result of the company’s investments in alternative energy and technology initiatives the company continued to invest in technology initiatives and increased investment in municipal securities during 2016 and 2017 generating tax credits and nontaxable income that benefited the tax rate each year 

on december 22 2017 hr 1 known as the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” was signed into law the act makes significant changes to the us internal revenue code of 1986 including a decrease in the current corporate federal income tax rate to 21 from 35 effective january 1 2018 as stated above the estimated provisional impact of the act on the net dta resulted in a noncash charge of 47 million through income tax expense the company anticipates that additional adjustments to net dta and income tax expense may be made in 2018 as deferred tax estimates are finalized for inclusion in the 2017 federal and state tax returns to be filed consistent with the measurement period afforded by sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” 

we had a net dta balance of 93 million at december 31 2017  compared with 250 million at december 31 2016  the decrease in the net dta resulted primarily from the reduction in the federal income tax rate from the act accelerated tax deductions on certain technology initiatives and depreciable property the payment of deferred compensation and a decrease in the allowance for loan losses a decrease in deferred tax liabilities during 2017 which related primarily to the deferred gain on a prior period debt exchange offset some of the overall net decrease 

we did not record any additional valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2017  see note 18  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 80  for additional information 

preferred stock dividends and redemption 

in 2017  we incurred preferred stock dividends of 40 million a decrease of 8 million from 2016  in 2016  we incurred preferred stock dividends of 48 million a decrease of 14 million from 2015  we completed a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2015 to purchase 176 million of our series i preferred stock we also completed tender offers of 144 million of series f and 118 million of series i j and g in the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 respectively preferred dividends are expected to be 8 million in the first and third quarters of 2018 and 10 million in the second and fourth quarters of 2018 see further details in note 13  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

business segment results 

following the close of business on december 31 2015 we completed the merger of our subsidiary banks with zions first national bank subsequently zions first national bank changed its legal name to zb national association we continue to manage our banking operations under our existing brand names and business segments including zions bank amegy bank california bank  trust national bank of arizona nevada state bank vectra bank colorado and the commerce bank of washington performance assessment and resource allocation are based upon this geographical structure

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases 

schedule 5    which we referenced in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of our interestearning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another goal is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets as a result of this goal we redeployed funds from loweryielding money market investments in addition to using wholesale borrowings to purchase agency securities 

average interestearning assets were 609 billion  in 2017  compared with 562 billion  in the previous year average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 935  in both 2017  and 2016  

average loans were 435 billion  in 2017  and 421 billion  in 2016  average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 668  in 2017  compared with 700  in 2016

investment securities portfolio 

we invest in securities to actively manage liquidity and interest rate risk in addition to generating revenue for the company refer to the “liquidity risk management” section on page 72  for additional information on management of liquidity and funding and compliance with basel iii and lcr requirements the following schedule presents a profile of our investment securities portfolio the amortized cost amounts represent the original cost of the investments adjusted for related accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments and for impairment losses including creditrelated impairment the estimated fair value measurement levels and methodology are discussed in note 3   of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedule 11   

investment securities portfolio 



the amortized cost of investment securities at december 31 2017  increased by 12 from the balance at december 31 2016  primarily due to purchases of agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities 

the investment securities portfolio includes 555 million of net premium that is distributed across various asset classes as illustrated in the preceding schedule the purchase premiums and discounts for both heldtomaturity “htm” and afs securities are amortized and accreted at a constant effective yield to the contractual maturity date and no assumption is made concerning prepayments as principal prepayments occur the portion of the unamortized premium or discount associated with the principal reduction is recognized as interest income in the period the principal is reduced premium amortization for 2017  was approximately 125 million compared with approximately 99 million in 2016  reducing the yield on securities in those years by 92 and 109 bps respectively the increased premium amortization is due to both an increased amount of agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities and sba loanbacked securities and changes in actual prepayment rates of underlying loans 

as of december 31 2017  under the gaap fair value accounting hierarchy 1 of the 152 billion fair value of the afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 99 was valued at level 2 and there were no level 3 afs securities at december 31 2016  1 of the 134 billion fair value of afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 99 was valued at level 2 and there were no level 3 afs securities see note 3  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value accounting 

schedule 12  presents the maturities of the different types of investments that we owned and the corresponding average yields as of december 31 2017  based on amortized cost expected maturities rather than contractual maturities are shown for sba securities agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities and certain agency and municipal securities see “liquidity risk management” on page 72  and notes 1  5  and 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our investment securities and their management

exposure to state and local governments 

we provide multiple products and services to state and local governments referred to collectively as “municipalities” including deposit services loans and investment banking services and we invest in securities issued by the municipalities 

schedule 13 summarizes our exposure to state and local municipalities 

schedule 13   

municipalities 



at december 31 2017  one municipal loan with a balance of 1 million was on nonaccrual a significant amount of the municipal loan and lease portfolio is secured by real estate and equipment and 79  of the outstanding credits were originated by cbt zions bank and vectra see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans 

growth in municipal exposure came primarily from increases in loans and leases and the municipal afs securities portfolio afs securities generally consist of securities with investmentgrade ratings from one or more major credit rating agencies 

foreign exposure and operations 

our credit exposure to foreign sovereign risks and total foreign credit exposure is not significant we also do not have significant foreign exposure to derivative counterparties we had no foreign deposits at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  

loans held for sale 

loans held for sale consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market were 44 million  at december 31 2017  compared with 172 million  at december 31 2016  these consumer loans are primarily fixedrate mortgages that are originated with the intent to be sold to third parties 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2017  net loans and leases accounted for 68 of total assets compared with 67 at the end of 2016  schedule 14 presents our loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2017  however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in a small number of cases we have hedged the repricing characteristics of our variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 68  

schedule 14   

loan portfolio by type and maturity 



as of december 31 2017  net loans and leases were 45 billion  reflecting a 5 increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations and loan purchases 

loan portfolio growth during 2017 was widespread across loan products and geographies with particular strength in   consumer 14 family residential commercial and industrial nonoil and gas municipal and commercial owneroccupied loans the growth in the loan portfolio was primarily at amegy cbt and vectra 

of the significant increases within the portfolio consumer 14 family residential loans increased 771 million due largely to an increase in loan production and loan purchases and commercial and industrial loans increased 551 million the impact of these increases was partially offset by a decrease of 219 million in our cre term portfolio 

commercial owneroccupied loans also increased 326 million during 2017 and 188 million during 2016 although we experienced continued runoff and attrition of the nre portfolio at zions bank these declines are not expected to continue at the same pace in 2018 the nre business is a wholesale business that depends upon loan referrals from other community banking institutions due to generally soft loan demand nationally many community banking institutions are retaining rather than selling their loan production 

we expect moderate total loan and lease growth during 2018 primarily in consumer 14 family residential municipal commercial and industrial nonoil and gas commercial owneroccupied nonnre and cre term loans we expect stable to slightly increasing growth in oil and gas loans partially offset by moderate attrition in the nre loan portfolio 

loans serviced for the benefit of others increased to 37 billion during 2017 from 35 billion in 2016 

other noninterestbearing investments 

during 2017 the company increased its shortterm borrowings with the fhlb by 31 billion this increase required a further investment in fhlb activity stock which consequently increased by 124 million during the year aside from this increase other noninterestbearing investments remained relatively stable as set forth in the following schedule schedule 15  sets forth our other noninterestbearing investments 

schedule 15   

other noninterestbearing investments 



premises equipment and software net 

net premises equipment and software increased 74 million  or 7  from the prior year primarily due to capitalized costs associated with the development of a new corporate facility for amegy bank in texas major software purchases and the capitalization of eligible costs related to the development of new lending deposit and reporting systems 

deposits 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company average total deposits increased  by 3  during 2017  compared with 2016  with average interestbearing deposits increasing by 1  and average noninterestbearing deposits increasing by 6  the average interest rate paid for interestbearing deposits was 3 bps higher in 2017  compared with 2016  

deposits at december 31 2017  excluding time deposits of 100000 and over and brokered deposits decreased by 2 or 10 billion from december 31 2016  the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in interestbearing domestic savings and money market deposits 

demand savings and money market deposits were 94 and 95 of total deposits at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  total deposits included 16 billion and 09 billion respectively of brokered deposits 

see notes 11  and 12   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity risk management” on page 72  for additional information on funding and borrowed funds 

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance the board of directors has appointed a risk oversight committee “roc” that consists of appointed board members who oversee the company’s risk management processes the roc meets on a regular basis to monitor and review enterprise risk management “erm” activities as required by its charter the roc performs oversight for various erm activities and approves erm policies and activities as detailed in the roc charter 

management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks these risks are overseen by the various management committees of which the enterprise risk management committee “ermc” is the focal point for the monitoring and review of enterprise risk 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

the board of directors through the roc is responsible for approving the overall credit policies relating to the management of the credit risk of the company in addition the roc oversees and monitors adherence to key credit policies and the credit risk appetite as defined in the risk appetite framework additionally the board has established the credit administration committee chaired by the chief credit officer and consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk for the company and approving changes to the company’s credit policies 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit risk management and credit examination functions our credit policies place emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses these formal credit policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level 

our credit risk management function is separate from the lending function and strengthens control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities in addition we have a welldefined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio and we utilize a comprehensive loan riskgrading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore the internal credit examination department which is independent of the lending function periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments and credit activities these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan riskgrading administration and compliance with credit policies new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the new initiative review committee 

our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio we attempt to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty generally our loan portfolio is well diversified however due to the nature of our geographical footprint there are certain significant concentrations primarily in cre and oil and gasrelated lending we have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on leveraged lending municipal lending oil and gasrelated lending and various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary the recent growth in construction and land development loan commitments is within the established concentration limits our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographical footprint of our banking affiliates 

as we continue to monitor our concentration risk the composition of our loan portfolio has slightly changed oil and gasrelated loans represented 4 of the total loan portfolio at december 31 2017 compared with 5 at december 31 2016 total commercial loans were 51 of the total portfolio compared with 50 at december 31 

2016 cre loans declined to 25 of the total portfolio compared with 27 at december 31 2016 consumer loans grew to represent 24 of the total loan portfolio at december 31 2017 compared with 23 at december 31 2016

risk management of the oil and gasrelated portfolio 

the oil and gasrelated portfolio is comprised of three primary segments upstream midstream and oil and gas services upstream exploration and production loan borrowers have relatively balanced production between oil and gas midstream loans are made to companies that gather transport treat and blend oil and natural gas or that provide services to similar companies oil and gas services loans which include oilfield services and oil and gas service manufacturing include borrowers that have a concentration of revenues in the oil and gas industry however many of these borrowers provide a broad range of products and services to the oil and gas industry and are diversified geographically 

we apply concentration limits and disciplined underwriting to the entire oil and gasrelated loan portfolio to limit our risk exposure as an indicator of the diversity in the size of our oil and gasrelated portfolio the average amount of our commitments is approximately 6 million with approximately 67 of the commitments less than 30 million additionally there are instances where we have commitments to companies with a common sponsor which if combined would result in higher commitment levels than 30 million the portfolio contains only senior loans—no junior or second lien positions additionally we cautiously approach making firstlien loans to borrowers that employ excessive leverage through the use of junior lien loans or unsecured layers of debt approximately 88 of the total oil and gasrelated portfolio is secured by reserves equipment real estate and other collateral or a combination of collateral types 

we participate as a lender in loans and commitments designated as shared national credits “sncs” which generally consist of larger and more diversified borrowers that have better access to capital markets sncs are loans or loan commitments of at least 20 million that are shared by three or more federally supervised institutions the percentage of sncs is 79 of the upstream portfolio 79 of the midstream portfolio and 44 of the oil and gas services portfolio our bankers have direct access and contact with the management of these snc borrowers and as such are active participants in many cases we provide ancillary banking services to these borrowers further evidencing this direct relationship the results of the fall 2017 snc exam are reflected in our financial statements 

as a secondary source of support many of our oil and gasrelated borrowers have access to capital markets and private equity sources private sponsors tend to be large funds often with assets under management of more than 1 billion managed by individuals with a great deal of oil and gas expertise and experience and who have successfully managed investments through previous oil and gas price cycles the investors in the funds are primarily institutional investors such as large pensions foundations trusts and high net worth family offices 

commercial real estate loans 

selected information indicative of credit quality regarding our cre loan portfolio is presented in the following schedule 

schedule 20 

commercial real estate portfolio by loan type and collateral location 





approximately 20  of the cre term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2017 for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to seven years the remaining 80  of cre loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project loantovalue ratio and occupancy rates   

approximately 144 million  or 10  of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2017 consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects 

of the total cre loan portfolio at december 31 2017 we categorize 18 billion as retail property where the ultimate use of the property is for retailing purposes the average loantovalue ratio for these loans is approximately 55 and more than 90 are occupied approximately 81 of our cre retail loans are to borrowers where the underlying retail businesses are not regional shopping centers but include neighborhood strip malls standalone retail facilities and singletenant buildings of the regional shopping center exposure approximately 94 is term debt and the criticized loan ratio is 53 we closely monitor the cre retail portfolio for tenant bankruptcy filings and store closures and have limited exposure to national tenants with announced bankruptcies 

underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily and hospitality construction projects we require substantial preleasingleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan significant consideration is given to the forecasted market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower generally by our internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed a new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness 

advance rates ie loan commitments will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and homes not under contract and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement 

the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing cre loans for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the 

potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes this repayment source into consideration 

when we modify or extend a loan we also give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether we have granted a concession in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists however if additional collateral is obtained or if a guarantor exists who has the capacity and willingness to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared with the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

a decrease in oil and gas prices could potentially produce an adverse impact on our cre loan portfolio within texas however based upon generally strong equity and cash flow coverage levels and sponsor support for the various properties we do not expect a material amount of losses within this portfolio in 2018 our largest cre credit exposures in texas are to the multifamily office and retail sectors at december 31 2017 the cre loan portfolio mix in texas was 72  commercial term 16  commercial construction 8  residential construction and 4  land development 

consumer loans 

we have mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality we generally hold variablerate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixedrate loans to third parties including federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards 

we are engaged in home equity credit line “hecl” lending at december 31 2017 our hecl portfolio totaled   28 billion  compared with 26 billion at december 31 2016 the following schedule describes the composition of our hecl portfolio by lien status 

schedule 21 

hecl portfolio by lien status 



at december 31 2017 loans representing less than 1 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateralvalue at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination 

approximately 93  of our hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 26  of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years we regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates the analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment the ratio of net chargeoffs to average balances at yearend 2017 and 2016 for the hecl portfolio was 002  and 001 respectively see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit quality of this portfolio 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned “oreo” decreased to 093 at december 31 2017 compared with 134 at december 31 2016 

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2017 decreased 155 million from december 31 2016 primarily in the oil and gasrelated loan portfolio however nonaccrual loans slightly increased in the commercial owneroccupied and 14 family residential loan portfolios the largest total decrease in nonaccrual loans occurred at amegy 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” following for more information company policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to cre term loans see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on nonaccrual loans 

the following schedule presents our nonperforming assets 

schedule 22 

nonperforming assets 



 restructured loans 

troubled debt restructurings “tdrs” are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties and for whom we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider tdrs decreased 25 million or 10 during 2017 primarily due to payments and payoffs commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship 

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether a loan should be returned to accrual status 

schedule 23   

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 



in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs

allowance for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the alll we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance our loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

schedule 25 

summary of loan loss experience 



schedule 26 

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 



the total alll decreased by 49 million during 2017 primarily as a result of credit quality improvements in the oil and gasrelated loan portfolio 

the rulc represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalancesheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is separately shown in the balance sheet and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are shown separately in the statement of income at december 31 2017 the reserve decreased by 7 million compared with december 31 2016 also as a result of credit quality improvements in the total loan portfolio 

see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acl and credit trends experienced in each portfolio segment 

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company including interest rate and market risk management the board has established the assetliability committee “alco” consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the company alco establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews with the roc the limits and limit exceptions reported by management 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to manage balance sheet sensitivity to reduce net income volatility due to changes in interest rates 

over the course of the last year we have actively reduced the level of asset sensitivity through the purchase of shorttomedium duration agency passthrough securities and funding these purchases by reducing money market investments and increasing shortterm borrowings this repositioning of the investment portfolio has increased current net interest income while dampening the impact of higher rates on net interest income growth we continue to anticipate higher net interest income in a rising rate environment as our assets reprice more quickly than our liabilities 

as most of our liabilities are comprised of indeterminate maturity and managed rate deposits behavioral assumptions for these deposits have a significant impact on our projected interest rate risk we have historically reported two sets of deposit assumptions fast and slow to reflect the uncertainty of deposit behavior and its impact on interest rate risk we have recently updated our deposit models and now disclose interest rate risk for only a single set of deposit behavioral assumptions the newly implemented method differs from prior methods primarily in the way we treat commercial checking deposits and in the manner by which we determine the portion of deposits that are core deposits for commercial checking deposits we have separated the balances into a core amount that is operational or that compensates for billed services and a complementary excess balance the excess balance is modeled with a high attrition rate whereas the core balance runs off more slowly for other deposit types the core balance is determined by the average balance over a longerterm horizon typically 24 to 48 months and excess balances are modeled with a high attrition rate 

interest rate risk measurement 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods net interest income simulation or earnings at risk “ear” and economic value of equity at risk “eve” ear analyzes the expected change in near term one year net interest income in response to changes in interest rates in the eve method we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates 

ear is an estimate of the change in total net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments over a oneyear period ear is measured simulating net interest income under several different scenarios including parallel and nonparallel interest rate shifts across the yield curve taking into account deposit repricing assumptions and estimates of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio eg a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lowerrate environment our policy contains a trigger for a 10 

decline over oneyear in rate sensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps 

eve is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities we measure changes in the dollar amount of eve for parallel shifts in interest rates due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in eve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney interest rate caps or limits on loans which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for lowrate mortgages in a higherrate environment our policy contains a trigger for an 8 decline in eve as well as a risk capacity of a 10 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps exceptions to the eve limits are subject to notification and approval by the roc 

estimating the impact on net interest income and eve requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration eg customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit competitive pricing eg existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates loan and security prepayments and the effects of other similar embedded options as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans we also calculate the sensitivity of ear and eve results to key assumptions the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options we use historical regression analysis as a guide to set such assumptions however due to the current low interest rate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit behavior may not reflect actual future results additionally competition for funding in the marketplace has and may again result in changes to deposit pricing on interestbearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as libor or the federal funds rate 

under most rising interest rate environments we would expect some customers to move balances from demand deposits to interestbearing accounts such as money market savings or certificates of deposit the models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration 

in addition we assume certain correlation rates often referred to as a “deposit beta” of interestbearing deposits wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared to changes in benchmark interest rates generally certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate while interestonchecking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate actual results may differ materially due to factors including competitive pricing money supply credit worthiness of the company and so forth however we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions 

the aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in schedule 27  

schedule 27   

deposit assumptions 



as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows ear or percentage change in net interest income based on a static balance sheet size in the first year after the interest rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

schedule 28   

income simulation – change in net interest income 



 for nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 362 if the weighted average deposit beta increased to 462 it would decrease the ear in the 200bp shock from 54 to 29 

the ear analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of rates the yield curve typically does not move in a parallel manner during the past year an increase in shortterm rates has led to a flatter yield curve as longerterm rates have not increased at the same pace as shortterm rates if we consider a flattening rate shock where the shortterm rate moves 200bp but the tenyear rate only moves 30bp the increase in earnings is 33 lower over 12 months compared with the parallel 200bp rate shock 

for comparative purposes the december 31 2016 measures as presented in the following schedule have been recalculated using the new methodology 

 the asset sensitivity as measured by ear declined yearoveryear due to continued purchases of mediumterm securities funded through reductions in money market investments and increases in shortterm borrowings 

schedule 29 

changes in economic value of equity 

as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in eve under parallel interest rate changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps for   nonmaturity interestbearing deposits the weighted average modeled beta is 362 if the weighted average deposit beta increased to 462 it would decrease the eve in the 200bp shock from 03 to 22 





for comparative purposes the december 31 2016  measures as presented in the following schedule have been recalculated using the new methodology the changes in eve measures are driven by the same factors as those in our income simulation 



 our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at december 31 2017  198 billion of the company’s commercial lending and cre loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate loans approximately 94 are tied to either the prime rate or libor for these variablerate loans we have executed 11 billion of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps additionally asset sensitivity is reduced due to 02 billion of variablerate loans being priced at floored rates at december 31 2017  which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 60 bps at december 31 2017  we also had 33 billion of variablerate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate consumer loans approximately 01 billion were priced at floored rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 42 bps 

see notes 3  and 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

market risk – fixed income 

we engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2017  we had a relatively small amount 148 million  of trading assets and 95 million  of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 115 million  and 25 million  respectively at december 31 2016  

we are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value we are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2017  the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs securities decreased by 3 million due largely to changes in the interest rate environment compared with a 74 million decrease in the same prior year period 

market risk – equity investments 

through our equity investment activities we own equity securities that are publiclytraded in addition we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and an fhlb that are not publiclytraded the accounting for equity investments may use the cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs we are exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investments committee consisting of members of management 

we hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly prepublic companies primarily through various small business investment company “sbic” venture capital funds our equity exposure to these investments was approximately 127 million and 124 million at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively on occasion some of the companies within our sbic investments may issue an initial public offering in this case the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment which can introduce additional market risk during the fourth quarter of 2017 we sold the remaining amount of our publiclytraded direct investment and as of december 31 2017  we had no publiclytraded stocks as part of our direct sbic investments 

additionally amegy has an alternative investments portfolio these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds are generally not a part of the strategy because the underlying companies are typically not creditworthy the carrying value of amegy ’ s equity investments was 12 million at december 31 2017  and 13 million at december 31 2016  

these peis are subject to the provisions of the doddfrank act the volcker rule of the doddfrank act prohibits banks and bank holding companies from holding peis except for sbic funds and certain other permitted exclusions beyond a required deadline the frb announced in december 2016 that it would allow banks to apply for an additional fiveyear extension beyond the july 21 2017 deadline to comply with the doddfrank act requirement for these investments the company applied for and was granted an extension for its eligible peis all positions in the remaining portfolio of peis are subject to the extended deadline or other applicable exclusions 

as of december 31 2017  such prohibited peis amounted to 3 million  with an additional 4 million  of unfunded commitments see notes 5  and 15  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information we currently do not believe that this divestiture requirement will ultimately have a material impact on our financial statements 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that our cash flows may not be adequate to fund our ongoing operations and meet our commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds for our customers’ credit needs or capital plan actions and our anticipated financial and contractual obligations which include withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardapproved corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines such as the “timetorequired funding” and lcr that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and zb na as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the parent and zb na 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally for the parent and jointly by the parent and bank management for its subsidiary bank the treasury department performs this management centrally under the direction of the corporate treasurer with oversight by alco the treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the company’s liquidity policy these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policy also must be approved by the company’s ermc and the board of directors the company has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk the policy requires the company to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows in the event of a severe liquidity crisis the company targets a buffer of highly liquid assets at the parent to cover 1824 months of cash outflows under a scenario with limited cash inflows and maintains a minimum policy limit of not less than 12 months the consolidated company exceeds the regulatory requirements of the modified lcr that mandates a buffer of hqla to cover 70 of 30day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated in the final liquidity rule additionally the company performs monthly liquidity stress testing using a set of internally generated scenarios representing severe liquidity constraints over a 12month horizon zb na maintains a buffer of highly liquid assets consisting of cash us agency and us government sponsored entity securities to cover 30day cash outflows under liquidity stress tests and maintains a contingency funding plan to identify funding sources that would be utilized over the extended 12month horizon throughout 2017 and as of december 31 2017 the company complied with this policy 

liquidity regulation 

us banking regulators issued a final rule in 2014 that implements a quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the lcr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under this rule we are subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold an adequate amount of unencumbered hqla that can be converted into cash easily and immediately in private markets to meet its liquidity needs for a shortterm liquidity stress scenario this rule became applicable to us on january 1 2016 

the basel iii liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure the nsfr which requires a financial institution to maintain a stable funding profile over a oneyear period in relation to the characteristics of its on and offbalance sheet activities on october 31 2014 the basel committee on banking supervision issued its final standards for this ratio entitled basel iii the net stable funding ratio  on may 3 2016 the frb issued a proposal requiring bank holding companies with less than 250 billion of assets but more than 50 billion of assets to cover 70 of 1year cash outflows under the assumptions required in the proposed nsfr rule under the proposal bank holding companies would be required to publicly disclose information about the nsfr levels each quarter as of december 31 2017 the frb has not published final rules on the nsfr we continue to monitor this proposal and any other developments based on this basel iii publication and the frb proposal we believe we would meet the minimum nsfr if such requirement were currently effective 

the enhanced prudential standards for liquidity management reg yy require us to conduct monthly liquidity stress tests these tests incorporate scenarios designed by us require a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under the stress scenarios and are subject to review by the frb the company’s internal liquidity stress testing program as contained in its policy complies with these requirements and includes monthly liquidity stress testing using a set of internally generated scenarios representing severe liquidity constraints over a 12month horizon 

contractual obligations 

schedule 30  summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2017  

schedule 30   

contractual obligations 





in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 30  we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

we also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

liquidity management actions 

consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements at the parent and its subsidiaries decreased to 16 billion at december 31 2017  from 25 billion at december 31 2016  the 09   billion decrease during 2017  resulted primarily from 1 net loan originations and purchases 2 an increase in investment securities 3 a net decrease in deposits 4 repurchase of our common stock 5 repayment of our longterm debt 6 repurchase and redemption of our preferred stock and 7 dividends on common and preferred stock these decreases were partially offset by shortterm fhlb borrowings and net cash provided by operating activities 

during 2017 our htm and afs investment securities increased by 17 billion this increase was primarily due to purchases of shorttomedium duration agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities prior to the second quarter of 2017 we were adding to our investment portfolio during the past couple of years to increase our hqla position in light of the new lcr rules and more broadly to manage balance sheet liquidity more effectively however during the second through the fourth quarters of 2017 our htm and afs investment securities decreased by 490 million and we expect the size of the investment portfolio to be generally stable during the next several quarters 

during 2017 we made cash payments totaling 153 million for our longterm debt which matured and did not incur any new longterm debt during the same time period see note 12  for additional detail about debt maturities and redemptions during 2017 and 2016 during 2017 we also increased our shortterm debt with the fhlb by 31 billion and had 36 billion outstanding as of december 31 2017 

parent company liquidity – the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate shares of current income taxes and longterm debt and equity issuances 

cash and interestbearing deposits held as investments at the parent decreased to 332 million at december 31 2017  from 531 million at december 31 2016  this 199 million decrease during 2017 resulted primarily from 1 repurchase of our common stock 2 repayment of longterm debt 3 repurchase and redemption of our preferred stock and 4 dividends on our common and preferred stock this decrease in cash was partially offset by common dividends and return of common equity and preferred dividends received by the parent from its subsidiary bank see notes 12  and 13  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our longterm debt and equity transactions 

during 2017  the parent received common dividends and return of common equity totaling 534 million and preferred dividends totaling 53 million from its subsidiary bank during 2016  the parent received common dividends and return of common equity totaling 250 million and preferred dividends totaling 13 million from its subsidiary bank at december 31 2017 zb na had 417 million available for the payment of dividends under current capital regulations the dividends that zb na can pay are restricted by current and historical earning levels retained earnings and riskbased and other regulatory capital requirements and limitations 

general financial market and economic conditions impact our access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets for the parent and its subsidiary bank is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the debt ratings and outlooks issued by the various rating agencies for the company and zb na improved during 2017 and are shown in the following schedules 

schedule 31  presents the company’s and zb na’s ratings as of december 31 2017  

schedule 31   

credit ratings 



the credit rating agencies all rate the company’s and zb na’s senior debt at an investmentgrade level in addition kroll rates the company’s subordinated debt at an investmentgrade level while sp rates the company’s subordinated debt as noninvestmentgrade 

the parent’s cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses decreased to 26 million in 2017  from 35 million in 2016  due to the maturity and repayment of longterm debt during 2017  and 2016 partially offset by the increase in interest from shortterm fhlb advances additionally the parent paid approximately 129 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock for 2017 compared to 108 million for 2016 

note 22  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and cash flows for 2017  2016  and 2015  as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2017  and 2016  

at december 31 2017 maturities of our longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from june 2023 to september 2028 with effective interest rates from 450 to 695 

see note 12  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of our longterm debt 

subsidiary bank liquidity – zb na’s primary source of funding is its core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits and time deposits under 250000 on a consolidated basis the company’s loan to total deposit ratio was 851 as of december 31 2017  compared to 801 as of december 31 2016  reflecting loan growth and a decrease in deposits during 2017 

total deposits decreased by 615 million to 526 billion at december 31 2017 compared to 532 billion at december 31 2016 this decrease was a result of a 744 million decrease in savings and money market deposits and a 229 million decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits the decrease was partially offset by a 358 million increase in time deposits also during the first quarter of 2017 zb na redeployed approximately 26 billion of cash to shorttomedium duration agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities 

zb na’s longterm senior debt ratings are slightly better than the company’s longterm senior debt ratings moody’s rated both zb na’s and the company’s longterm senior debt as baa3 however standard  poor’s and kroll both rated zb na’s longterm senior debt one notch higher than the company’s ratings see schedule 31 

the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and from time to time have been a significant source of funding zb na is a member of the fhlb of des moines the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements the bank is required to invest in fhlb and federal reserve stock to maintain their borrowing capacity 

at december 31 2017 the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 147 billion compared with 171 billion at december 31 2016 loans with a carrying value of approximately 256 billion  at december 31 2017 have been pledged at the fhlb of des moines and the federal reserve as collateral for current and potential borrowings compared with 240 billion at december 31 2016 at december 31 2017 we had 36 billion of shortterm fhlb borrowings outstanding and no longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding compared with 500 million of shortterm fhlb borrowings and no longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding at december 31 2016 at december 31 2017 our total investment in fhlb and federal reserve stock was 154 million and 184 million respectively compared with 30 million and 181 million at december 31 2016 our increased investment in fhlb stock was a result of our increase in shortterm fhlb borrowings during 2017 

our investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture taken during 2017 htm  afs investment securities’ activities resulted in a net increase in investment securities and a net 22 billion decrease in cash compared with a net 59 billion decrease in cash for 2016  

maturing balances in our subsidiary bank’s loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows lending activity for both 2017  and 2016 resulted in a net cash outflow of 21 billion 

during 2017  we paid income taxes of 246 million compared to 214 million during 2016  

operational risk management 

operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events in our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk we have an erm department whose responsibility is to help employees management and the board of directors to assess understand measure manage and monitor risk in accordance with our risk appetite framework we have documented both controls and the control selfassessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and the fdicia 

to manage and minimize our operational risk we have in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate our systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to those systems to our legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s compliance risk management internal audit and credit examination departments reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data in addition the data governance department has key governance surrounding data integrity and availability further we have key programs and procedures to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters we also mitigate certain operational risks through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

we are continually improving our oversight of operational risk including enhancement of risk identification risk and control selfassessments and antifraud measures which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees the operational risk committee reports to the ermc which reports to the roc key measures have been established to increase oversight by erm and operational risk management through the strengthening of new initiative reviews enhancements to the enterprise procurement and third party risk management framework enhancements to the business continuity and disaster recovery programs and enterprise security programs and the establishment of fraud risk oversight incident response oversight and technology project oversight programs significant enhancements have also been made to governance technology and reporting including the establishment of policy and committee governance programs the implementation of a governance risk and control solution and the creation of an enterprise risk profile and an operational risk profile along with business line risk profiles in addition the establishment of an enterprise exam management department has standardized our response and reporting and increased our effectiveness and efficiencies with regulatory examinations communications and issues management 

the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our critical systems sometimes referred to as hacking cyber fraud cyber attacks cyber terrorism or other similar names also continue to grow given the importance and increasing sophistication of cyber attacks the company has designated cyber risk a level one risk in its risk taxonomy which places it at the highest level of oversight with its other top risks 

capital management 

overview 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” chaired by the chief financial officer and consisting of members of management whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary bank other major cmc responsibilities include 

 the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and zb na to 

 capital planning and stress testing 

the cmc oversees the company’s capital stress testing under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios we have established processes to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the company under hypothetical economic scenarios these stress tests facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity within quantitative limits reflecting the board of directors’ risk appetite these processes are also used to complete the company’s dfast as required by the doddfrank act and hcrccar as required by the federal reserve 

filing a capital plan with the federal reserve based on stress testing and documented sound policies processes models controls and governance practices and the subsequent review by the federal reserve is an annual regulatory requirement this capital plan which is subject to objection by the federal reserve governs all of the company’s capital and significant unsecured debt financing actions for a period of five quarters among the actions governed by the capital plan are the repurchase of outstanding capital securities and the timing of new capital issuances and whether the company can pay or increase dividends any such action not included in a capital plan to which the federal reserve has not objected cannot be executed without submission of a revised stress test and capital plan for federal reserve review and nonobjection de minimis changes are allowed without a complete plan resubmission subject to receipt of a federal reserve nonobjection regulations require company disclosure of these stress tests results 

as a bank holding company with assets greater than 50 billion we are required by the doddfrank act to participate in annual stress tests known as the dfast in addition we are required to participate in the federal reserve board’s annual hcrccar for large and noncomplex firms generally bank holding companies with assets between 50 billion and 250 billion in our capital plan we are required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios our estimated regulatory capital ratios and our gaap tangible common equity ratio 

a detailed discussion of hcrccardfast requirements is contained on page 11  of the “capital plan and stress testing” section under part 1 item 1 in this annual report on form 10k 

we submitted our stress test results and 2017 capital plan to the frb on april 5 2017 on june 28 2017 the board of governors of the federal reserve system notified zions bancorporation that the federal reserve does not object to zions bancorporation’s boardapproved 2017 capital plan our capital plan for the period spanning july 1 2017 through june 30 2018 includes up to 465 million of common stock repurchases and approximately 140 million of common stock dividends as follows 

 capital actions are subject to final approval by zions bancorporation’s board of directors and may be influenced by among other things actual earnings performance business needs and prevailing economic conditions 

on june 22 2017 we filed a form 8k presenting the results of the 2017 dfast exercise the results of zions’ published stress tests demonstrate that the company believes it has sufficient capital to withstand a severe hypothetical economic downturn detailed disclosure of the stress test results can be found on our website 

on june 29 2016 we filed a form 8k announcing that the frb did not object to our 2016 capital plan which spans the timeframe of july 31 2016 to june 30 2017 the plan included 1 the increase of the quarterly common dividend to 008 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2016 2 up to 180 million in total repurchases of common equity and 3 up to 144 million in total repurchases of preferred equity 

as planned our quarterly dividend on common stock increased to 016 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017 as of december 31 2017 the company has repurchased 230 million of its common stock at an average price of 4742 per share under the 2017 capital plan and 180 million of its common stock at an average price of 3566 per share under the 2016 capital plan 

during the first quarter of 2018 the company repurchased an additional 115 million  of its common stock at an average price of 5346  per share leaving 120 million  of repurchase capacity remaining in the 2017 capital plan which spans the timeframe of july 2017 to june 2018 

also in accordance with our 2016 capital plan we redeemed all outstanding shares of our 79 series f preferred stock on the redemption date of june 15 2017 

basel iii 

in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the rules implemented the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 and were subject to phasein periods for certain of their components in november 2017 the frb fdic and occ published a final rule for nonadvanced approaches banks that extends the regulatory capital 

treatment applicable during 2017 under the regulatory capital rules for certain items we met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules as of december 31 2017 

a detailed discussion of basel iii requirements including implications for the company is contained on page 10  of the “capital standards – basel framework” section under part 1 item 1 in this annual report on form 10k 

capital management actions 

total shareholders’ equity increased by 45 million to 77 billion at december 31 2017 from 76 billion at december 31 2016 the increase in total shareholders’ equity is primarily due to net income of 592 million this increase is partially offset by repurchases of our common stock under our repurchase program totaling 320 million 144 million paid to redeem our series f preferred stock and common and preferred dividends of 129 million 

during the latter part of 2016 and throughout 2017 the market price of our common stock increased above the exercise price of common stock warrants on our common stock as of december 31 2017  we have 293 million  common stock warrants at an exercise price of 3537 which expire on may 22 2020 and 58 million  common stock warrants at an exercise price of 3627 per share which expire on november 14 2018  see note 13  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our common stock warrants the increase in the market price of our common stock increased our diluted shares throughout 2017 and for the fourth quarter of 2016 but did not effect on our diluted shares for the full 2016 year 

between january 1 2018 and february 20 2018 10 million shares of common stock were issued from the cashless exercise of 32 million common stock warrants which expire on november 14 2018 after these common stock warrant exercises 293 million and 26 million common stock warrants which expire on may 22 2020 and november 14 2018 respectively remain outstanding

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the company’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements gaap has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs 

other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the company’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available the company is required to make judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available the company uses valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors investment securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of otherthantemporary impairment “otti” otti is considered to have occurred if the instrument’s fair value is below its amortized cost and 1 we intend to sell the security or 2 it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis the “more likely than not” criterion is a lower threshold than the “probable” criterion 

notes 1  5  7  9  and 3  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the “investment securities portfolio” on page 50  contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

allowance for credit losses 

the acl includes the alll and the rulc the alll represents management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses as well as a qualitative review of the results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment and is described in more detail in note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the rulc provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the alll plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses   as an example if the probability of default risk grade for all passgraded commercial and cre loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal risk grading scale the quantitatively determined amount of the alll at december 31 2017  would increase by approximately 105 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in risk grades may have on the allowance estimate 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the acl we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the acl the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 56   contains further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the acl 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this annual test as of september 30 of each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit generally one of our banking segments compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired 

to determine the fair value we use a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publiclytraded financial service companies primarily banks and bank holding companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the company is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the company’s geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium ranging from 0 to 15 for the reporting units was appropriate at the most recent test date 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount estimates include economic conditions which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve 

monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the company ’ s regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2017  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective september 30 2017  we concluded that none of our reporting units was impaired furthermore the evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 35 54 and 78 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100bps the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 33 52 and 72 respectively 

income taxes 

we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities calculation of the provision for income taxes requires significant judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of these tax laws as we prepare the company’s tax returns these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

on december 22 2017 hr 1 known as the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” was signed into law the act makes significant changes to the us internal revenue code of 1986 including a decrease in the current corporate federal income tax rate to 21 from 35 effective january 1 2018 in conjunction with the enactment of the act the sec issued sab 118 to address the accounting for certain income tax effects of the act that may not be complete by the time financial statements are issued the company evaluated all available information and made reasonable estimates of the impact of the act to substantially all components of its net dta the provisional impact of the act on the net dta resulted in a noncash charge of 47 million recorded through income tax expense the company anticipates that additional adjustments to net dta and income tax expense may be made in 2018 as the company’s initial determination of the tax basis of deferred items such as foregone interest equity investments in flowthrough entities certain employee compensation arrangements fdicsupported transactions and premises and equipment are finalized these adjustments will be recorded in the financial statements in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined however sab 118 requires all impacts from the act to be recorded prior to december 22 2018 which is one year from the enactment date of the act 

in 2017  the company early adopted the guidance in asu 201802 which allows reclassification from aoci to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects related to the change in the corporate income tax rate from the act the early adoption of the guidance resulted in a 25 million  increase to retained earnings out of aoci as of december 31 2017  

we had net dtas of 93 million at december 31 2017  compared with 250 million at december 31 2016  the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the alll 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities 3 pension and postretirement obligations and 4 deferred compensation arrangements no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2017  related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank 

subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to 1 carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods 2 utilize the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences 3 implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible and 4 generate future taxable income 

after considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits we have tax reserves at december 31 2017  of approximately 5 million net of federal andor state benefits primarily relating to uncertain tax positions for tax credits on technology initiatives

competition 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks credit unions and thrifts including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds insurance companies brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies financial technology and other nontraditional lending and banking companies and a variety of other types of companies these companies may have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered the quality of service delivered and pricing the company must compete effectively along all of these dimensions to remain successful 

supervision and regulation 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended among other things to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers including both loan customers and depositors and taxpayers these regulations are not however generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors and in fact may have the consequence of reducing returns to our shareholders this regulatory framework has been materially revised and expanded since the 20082009 financial crisis and recession in particular the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated pursuant to it have given financial regulators expanded powers over nearly every aspect of the company’s business these include among other things new higher regulatory capital requirements regulation of dividends and other forms of capital distributions to shareholders through annual stresstesting and capitalplanning processes heightened liquidity and liquidity stresstesting requirements which include specific definitions of the types of investment securities that qualify as “highquality liquid assets” and which effectively limit the portion of the company’s balance sheet that can be used to meet the credit needs of its customers specific limitations on mortgage lending products and practices specific limits on certain consumer payment fees and subjecting compensation practices to specific regulatory oversight and restrictions individually and collectively these additional regulations have imposed and will continue to impose higher costs on the company and have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking the 

majority of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation or clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined recent political developments including the change in the executive administration of the united states have increased uncertainty to the implementation scope and timing of regulatory reforms including those related to the implementation of the doddfrank act the company is committed to both satisfying heightened regulatory expectations and providing attractive shareholder returns however given the stillchanging regulatory environment and such uncertainty the results of these efforts cannot yet be known 

described below are the material elements of some selected laws and regulations applicable to the company the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable laws or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the company 

the parent is a bank holding company and a financial holding company as provided by the bhc act as modified by the glb act and the doddfrank act these and other federal statutes provide the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the federal reserve board “frb” the supervision of zb na and other regulated subsidiaries is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator and the laws and regulations administered by those regulators the glb act allows our subsidiary bank to engage in certain financial activities through financial subsidiaries to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company or to do business through a financial subsidiary the parent and its subsidiary bank must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required 

zb na is subject to the provisions of the national bank act or other statutes governing national banks as well as the rules and regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” and the fdic it is also subject to examination and supervision by the occ in addition zions bancorporation is subject to examination by the federal reserve bank of san francisco some of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other federal and state agencies these regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec financial industry regulatory authority “finra” andor state securities regulators 

the doddfrank act 

the most recent financial crisis led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states implementation of the doddfrank act and related rulemaking activities continued in 2016 

the doddfrank act and regulations adopted under the doddfrank act broadly affect the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities requiring ongoing stress testing of our capital and liquidity mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring divestiture of certain equity investments increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector among other things affecting capital standards the doddfrank act provides that 

 regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act require us to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets than was generally the case before the crisis and limit the forms of capital that we will be able to rely upon for regulatory purposes in addition in its supervisory role with respect to our stress testing and capital planning our 

ability to deliver returns to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases is subject to prior nonobjection by the frb the stresstesting and capitalplan processes also could substantially reduce our flexibility to respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and the pricing of certain products and services including the following 

 the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining large financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws which had enabled national banks and their subsidiaries to comply with federal regulatory requirements without complying with various state laws in addition the doddfrank act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

the doddfrank act contains numerous provisions that limit or place significant burdens and costs on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds for the affected activities these provisions may result in increased compliance and other costs increased legal risk and decreased scope of product offerings and earning assets 

the company is subject to the provisions of the volcker rule issued pursuant to the doddfrank act the company had divested of all but 6 million  of noncompliant private equity investments “peis” such investments also provide for 4 million  of potential capital calls which the company would fund as allowed by the volcker rule if and as the capital calls are made until the investments are sold nevertheless because the remaining investments are comprised of funds that are in the later stages of their lifecycle significant future funding requests are not anticipated the company continues to pursue the disposition of all noncompliant peis the frb has granted a blanket extension of the volcker rule compliance date to july 21 2017 pursuant to procedures for requesting an extended transition period for illiquid funds outlined in sr 1618 issued by the frb on december 9 2016 the company applied for an extension for the vast majority of its remaining portfolio of peis if granted the extended transition period may be for up to five years beyond the compliance date of july 21 2017 to conform remaining investments 

the company and other companies subject to the doddfrank act are subject to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules these restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act include documentation and governance deferral risk balancing and clawback requirements any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions or could result in regulatory enforcement actions 

during the second quarter of 2016 the us financial regulators including the frb and the sec proposed revised 

rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets including zions the proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion such as zions and further more stringent requirements for those with total consolidated assets of at least 250 billion the general qualitative requirements include i prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation ii prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage 

inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss iii establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward iv requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and v mandating appropriate recordkeeping for larger financial institutions including zions the proposed revised regulations would also introduce very prescriptive requirements relating to the types and percentages the timing of the realization and the risk of forfeiture of incentive compensation awarded to “senior executive officers” and “significant risktakers” 

some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation or clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined 

capital standards – basel framework 

the basel iii capital rules which effectively replaced the basel i rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components and other provisions in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the rules implemented the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revised the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company compared to the basel i us riskbased capital rules 

the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replaced the riskweighting approach derived from basel i capital accords of the basel committee with a more risksensitive approach based in part on the standardized approach in the basel committee’s 2004 basel ii capital accords the basel iii capital rules also implemented the requirements of section 939a of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules 

the basel iii capital rules among other things i introduced a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” ii specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements iii applied most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and iv expanded the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared to prior regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows 

 when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 the basel iii capital rules will also require the company and its subsidiary bank to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and will increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

the basel iii capital rules also prescribed a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expanded the riskweighting categories from basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules provided more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increased the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

the basel iii capital rules provided for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets “dtas” dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 the application of this part of the rule did not result in any deductions from cet1 for us 

under prior basel i capital standards the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” items included in capital were excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios as a “nonadvanced approaches banking organization” we made a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items as allowed under the basel iii capital rules 

basel iii also required additional regulatory capital disclosures to be made that are commonly referred to as “pillar 3” disclosures these disclosures require the company to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding its capital structure adequacy and riskweighted assets the company began publishing these pillar 3 disclosures in 2015 and such disclosures are available on the company’s website 

the company met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules based upon a 2016 phasein as of december 31 2016 and believes it would meet all capital adequacy requirements on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective 

capital planning and stress testing 

the company is required by the doddfrank act to participate in annual stress tests known as the doddfrank act stress test “dfast” and frb’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” the company submitted its 2016 capital plan and stress test results to the frb on april 5 2016 in its capital plan the company was required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios for nine quarters ending the fourth quarter of 2017 its estimated regulatory capital ratios including its tier 1 common ratio associated with the basel i capital rules its cet1 ratio under the basel iii capital rules and its gaap tangible common equity ratio on june 29 2016 we announced that the frb notified us that it did not object to the capital actions outlined in our 2016 capital plan the plan included 1 the increase of the quarterly common dividend to 008 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2016 2 up to 180 million in total repurchases of common equity and 3 up to 144 million in total repurchases of preferred equity 

on june 23 2016 we filed a form 8k presenting the results of the 2016  dfast the results of the stress test demonstrated that the company has sufficient capital to withstand a severe hypothetical economic downturn detailed disclosure of the stress test results can also be found on our website in addition we submitted on october 5 2016 our midcycle companyrun dfast based upon the company’s june 30 2016 financial position zions’ midcycle dfast results based on the hypothetical severely adverse scenario indicate the company would maintain capital ratios at sufficient levels throughout the ninequarter forecasting horizon as discussed in the midcycle press release published november 4 2016 zions’ hypothetical severely adverse scenario was designed to create a stressful idiosyncratic environment including a 10 unemployment rate and a 40 decline in commercial property values during the ninequarter projection period the minimum cet1 ratio was 78 

zions has participated in the annual ccardfast exercise since 2014 prior to 2017 the frb could object to zions’ capital plan on either quantitative or qualitative grounds on january 30 2017 the frb announced a final rule for the 2017 cycle removing from the qualitative assessment of the exercise those bank holding companies that 

have total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion but less than 250 billion onbalance sheet foreign exposure of less than 10 billion and nonbank assets of less than 75 billion referred to as large and noncomplex “lnc” firms however the frb may still object to a capital plan based on the results of its quantitative assessment as an lnc firm zions will still be subject to regular supervisory assessments to examine the company’s capitalplanning processes our annual capital plan is due by april each year and the frb will publish results of its supervisory ccar review of our capital plan by june 30 of each year 

on february 17 2014 the frb published final rules to implement section 165 enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the board of governors and certain bank holding companies  of the doddfrank act the company believes that it is in compliance with these rules 

liquidity 

historically regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter both in the united states and internationally without required formulaic measures however in january 2016 zions became subject to final rules adopted by the frb and other banking regulators “final liquidity coverage ratio requirement “lcr” rule” implementing a us version of the basel committee’s lcr requirement the lcr is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of socalled “highquality liquid assets” “hqla” to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30day stress scenario zions is subject to the modified lcr which is the ratio of an institution’s amount of hqla the numerator over 70 of projected net cash outflows over the 30day horizon the denominator in each case as calculated pursuant to the final lcr rule the final lcr rule requires institutions subject to the modified lcr to maintain the modified ratio equal to at least 100 in order to satisfy this regulatory requirement only specific classes of assets including us treasury securities other us government obligations and agency mortgagebacked securities qualify under the rule as hqla with classes of assets deemed relatively less liquid andor subject to greater degree of credit risk subject to certain haircuts and caps for purposes of calculating the numerator under the final lcr rule the total net cash outflows amount is determined under the rule by applying certain hypothetical outflow and inflow rates which reflect certain standardized stressed assumptions against the balances of the banking organization’s funding sources obligations transactions and assets over the 30day stress period inflows that can be included to offset outflows are limited to 75 of outflows which effectively means that banking organizations must hold hqla equal to 25 of outflows even if outflows perfectly match inflows over the stress period 

the basel iii framework also included a second standard referred to as the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may 2016 the frb and other federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the proposed rule the most stringent requirements would apply to bank holding companies with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more in onbalance sheet foreign exposure and would require such organizations to maintain a minimum nsfr of 10 on an ongoing basis calculated by dividing the organization’s available stable funding “asf” by its required stable funding “rsf” bank holding companies with less than 250 billion but more than 50 billion in total consolidated assets and less than 10 billion in onbalance sheet foreign exposure such as zions would be subject to a modified nsfr requirement which would require such bank holding companies to maintain a minimum nsfr of 07 on an ongoing basis under the proposed rule a banking organization’s asf would be calculated by applying specified standard weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability over a oneyear time horizon and its rsf would be calculated by applying specified standardized weightings to its assets derivative exposures and commitments based on their liquidity characteristics over the same oneyear time horizon if implemented the proposed rule would take effect on january 1 2018 

financial privacy and cyber security 

the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is 

transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision once established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyber attack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards 1 cyber risk governance 2 cyber risk management 3 internal dependency management 4 external dependency management and 5 incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia as modified by the basel iii capital rules an insured depository institution generally will be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its cet1 ratio is under 3 its total riskbased capital ratio is less than 8 its tier 1 riskbased capital ratio is less than 6 or its tier 1 leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan 

other regulations 

the company is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 



stress test and capital plan to which the frb has not objected see discussion under “liquidity management actions” on page 74  

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive 

compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has overseen management’s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk practices this system includes policies and guidelines such as corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of company stock by insiders and charters for the audit risk oversight compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 




 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s growth strategy is driven by key factors while adhering to defined risk parameters the key elements of zions’ strategy reflect its prudent risktaking philosophy the company generates revenue by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks these factors are outlined in the company’s risk appetite framework 

the company’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee of the board approved an enterprise risk management framework and appointed an enterprise risk management committee “ermc” consisting of senior management to oversee and implement the framework the company’s most significant risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in prudent extension of credit to relationship customers in addition to credit risk these committees also monitor the following risk areas market and interest rate risks liquidity risk strategicbusiness risk operationaltechnology risks model risk capitalfinancial reporting risks legalcompliance risks including regulatory risk and reputational risk as outlined in the company’s risk taxonomy additional governance and oversight includes boardapproved policies and management committees with direct focus on these specific risk categories 

although not comprehensive the following describes several risk factors which are significant to the company 

credit risk 

credit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks if the strength of the us economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations declined this could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses “alll” 

we have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio including loans secured by real estate and oil and gasrelated lending which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results given the current volatility in oil prices and the potential for oil prices to remain low for an extended period of time zions’ credit exposure in oil and gas could be adversely impacted 

concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the company concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the company due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk 

we engage in commercial construction and land acquisition and development lending as well as commercial term lending primarily in our western states footprint the company as a whole has relatively larger concentrations of such lending than many other peer institutions in addition we have a concentration in oil and gasrelated lending primarily in texas both commercial real estate “cre” and oil and gasrelated lending are subject to specific risks including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateralvalues and activity levels in addition our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states and values there may behave differently than in other parts of the united states we may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the united states 

as a regional bank holding company the company provides a full range of banking and related services through its local management teams and unique brands in arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah washington and wyoming approximately 84 of the company’s total net interest income for the year ended december 31 2016  relate to our banking operations in utah texas and california this is compared to 88 of the company’s total net interest income for the year ended december 31 2015  as a result of this geographic concentration our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results for example our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events at december 31 2016  loan balances associated with our banking operations in utah texas and california comprised 81 of the company’s commercial lending portfolio 74 of the cre lending portfolio and 69 of the consumer lending portfolio 

loans originated by our banking operations in utah texas and california are primarily to borrowers in those respective states with the exception of the national real estate group which cooriginates or purchases primarily owneroccupied firstlien cre loans from financial institutions throughout the country 

we have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

adverse economic conditions negatively affect the company’s assets including its loan and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition the most recent financial crisis resulted in significant regulatory changes that continue to affect the company although economic conditions have improved since the most recent financial crisis it is possible that economic conditions may weaken or that sluggish economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time economic and fiscal conditions in the united states and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic and market conditions faced by the company and its customers any sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions would adversely affect the 

company the company has exposure to oil and gasrelated companies that are currently experiencing a prolonged period of low energy prices for more information regarding the company’s exposure to oil and gasrelated companies see “oil and gasrelated exposure” on page 57  of mda in this form 10k 

market and interest rate risks 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability management committee which is appointed by the company’s board of directors failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect the company factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

the company remains in an “assetsensitive” interest rate risk position which means that net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates increase and to decline if interest rates decrease most recently the frb raised the target range for federal funds rate from 050 to 075 and indicated that it will determine the timing and size of future rate adjustments by assessing realized and expected economic conditions relative to the objectives of maximum employment and 2 inflation 

financial market participants have recently contemplated the possibility of negative interest rates with the exception of brief money market disruptions in which some us treasury bills traded at negative rates the us has not previously experienced a negative rate environment although other developed economies have had prolonged periods of negative rates therefore there are many unknown factors which could impact the company in a negative rate environment the ability to effectively charge customers interest on deposits will be determined largely by competition for deposits but the company’s deposit systems may require modification to allow for negative deposit rates asset allocation strategies would be reconsidered were the frb to charge for excess reserves 

our estimates of our interest rate risk position related to noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on assumptions for which there is little historical experience and the actual behavior of those deposits in a changing interest rate environment may differ materially from our estimates which could materially affect our results of operations 

we have experienced a low interest rate environment for the past several years our views with respect to among other things the degree to which we are “assetsensitive” including our interest rate risk position for noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on modeled projections that rely on assumptions regarding changes in balances of such deposits in a changing interest rate environment because there is no modern precedent for the prolonged extremely low interest rate environment that has prevailed for the last several years there is little historical experience upon which to base such assumptions if interest rates continue to increase our assumptions regarding changes in balances of noninterestbearing demand deposits and regarding the speed and degree to which other deposits are repriced may prove to be incorrect and business decisions made in reliance on our modeled projections and underlying assumptions could prove to be unsuccessful because noninterestbearing demand deposits are a significant portion of our deposit base realized results which are different from our modeled projections and the underlying assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

liquidity risk 

as a regulated entity we are subject to capital and liquidity requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth 

we are a bank holding company and as such we and our subsidiary bank are subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the frb the occ and the fdic including riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements and basel iii liquidity requirements capital needs may rise above normal levels when 

we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition risk profile and growth plans in addition we may be required to increase our capital levels even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts as a result of stress testing and capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios compliance with the capital requirements including leverage ratios may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels for a summary of the capital rules to which we are subject see “capital standards – basel framework” on page 9  of this annual report on form 10k 

liquidity regulations including regulations establishing a minimum liquidity coverage ratio and requiring monthly liquidity stress testing applicable to the company may impact profitability 

the company is subject to liquidity regulations including a requirement that it conduct monthly liquidity stress tests that require it to maintain a modified lcr of at least 100 the company’s calculation of the modified lcr indicates that the company is in compliance with the requirement such stress testing is subject to ongoing model and assumptions changes which could affect results 

in order to meet the requirements of these new regulations the company expects to continue to hold a higher portion of its assets in highquality liquid assets “hqla” and a lower portion of its assets in loans than was generally the case prior to such regulation hqla generally have lower yields than loans of the type made by the company 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us and particular classes of securities that we and our banking subsidiary issue the rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies ratings downgrades to us or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

strategicbusiness risks 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us information security and vendor management processes are in place to actively identify manage and monitor actual and potential impacts 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

we have made and are continuing to make significant changes to the company that include among other things the combination of certain of our subsidiary companies into a single entity other organizational restructurings efficiency initiatives and replacement or upgrades of certain core technological systems to improve our control environment operating efficiency and results of operations the ultimate success and completion of these 

changes and their effect on the company may vary significantly from initial planning which could materially adversely affect the company 

during 2013 our board of directors approved a significant investment by us to replace our loan and deposit systems and to upgrade our accounting systems the new integrated system for most of our loans and deposits is expected to employ technology that is a significant improvement over our current systems these initiatives will be completed in phases to allow for appropriate testing and implementation so as to minimize time delays and cost overruns in december 2015 the company consolidated its seven subsidiary banks a subsidiary trust company and our service company into a single bank the company also decided to make other organizational changes such as the realignment of management responsibilities and the rationalization of support functions including accounting and risk and backoffice operations additionally in june 2015 management announced certain efficiency initiatives to improve operating results and return on equity 

these changes continue to be implemented and some are in their early stages by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings expected efficiencies and related items are subject to change and significant variability 

we may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these changes these may include significant time delays cost overruns loss of key people technological problems processing failures and other adverse developments our ability to attract key employees with appropriate talent to implement these changes may also be challenged further our ability to maintain an adequate control environment may be impacted any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems processes controls procedures and employees which may adversely impact our customers and our ability to conduct business 

we have plans policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these potential adverse developments however there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately remediated the ultimate effect of any adverse development could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect the company including its control environment operating efficiency and results of operations 

operationaltechnology risks 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and the company 

the company has significant operations and a significant customer base in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy the company’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to the company’s property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the company’s customers and in turn on the company although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations these efforts also include the management of controls to mitigate operational risks for programs and processes across the company 

we could be adversely affected by financial technology advancements and other nontraditional lending and banking sources 

the ability to successfully remain competitive is dependent upon our ability to maintain a critical technological capability and to identify and develop new valueadded products for existing and future customers failure to do so could impede our time to market reduce customer product accessibility and weaken our competitive position 

we are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations information security risks for large financial institutions such as zions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of cyber criminals any failure interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems misappropriation of funds and theft disclosure or misuse of proprietary company or customer data while we have significant internal resources policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

model risk 

we increasingly use models in the management of the company and in particular in the required stress testing and capital plan there is risk that these models are incorrect or inaccurate in various ways which can cause us to make nonoptimal decisions and this risk causes the company to hold additional capital as a buffer against that risk 

we attempt to carefully develop document back test and validate the models used in the management of the company including for example models used in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk and those used in projecting stress losses in various segments of our credit and securities portfolios and projecting net revenue under stress models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons however and cannot perfectly predict outcomes management decisions based in part on such models therefore can be suboptimal in addition in determining the company’s capital needs under stress testing we attempt to specifically quantify the amounts by which model results could be incorrect and we hold material additional amounts of capital as a buffer against this “model risk” 

capitalfinancial reporting risks 

stress testing and capital management under the doddfrank act may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

under the ccar we are required to submit to the frb each year our capital plan for the applicable planning horizon along with the results of required stress tests each annual capital plan will among other things specify our planned capital actions with respect to dividends preferred stock redemptions common stock buybacks or issuances and similar matters and will be subject to the objection or nonobjection by the frb moreover the ccar process requires us to analyze the pro forma impact on our financial condition of various hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios selected by us and the frb we must maintain or raise capital sufficient to meet our risk management and regulatory expectations under such hypothetical scenarios in connection with the annual ccar process we also participate in the dfast on a semiannual basis under dfast a standardized strategy for capital actions dividend payments held constant and other current capital obligations met is implemented by all 

participating banks as required by the doddfrank act we also submit stress tests to the occ for our subsidiary bank because it has assets in excess of 10 billion under both ccar and dfast the frb uses its proprietary models to analyze the company’s stressed capital position the severity of the hypothetical scenarios devised by the frb and occ and employed in these stress tests is undefined by law or regulation and is thus subject solely to the discretion of the regulators the stresstesting and capitalplanning processes may among other things require us to increase our capital levels limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under stress testing and capital management standards implemented by bank regulatory agencies under the doddfrank act we may declare dividends repurchase common stock redeem preferred stock and debt access capital markets for certain types of capital make acquisitions and enter into similar transactions only if included in a capital plan to which the frb has not objected any similar transactions not contemplated in our annual capital plan other than those with an inconsequential impact on actual or projected capital may require a new stress test and capital plan which is subject to frb nonobjection these requirements may significantly limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

the company and its subsidiary bank must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by its banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios and the particular conditions risk profiles and growth plans of the company and its subsidiary bank compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require the company or its subsidiaries to raise additional capital or may require additional capital investment from the parent these uncertainties and risks including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties may increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the company provides to its customers invests in and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the company to comply before their formal adoption therefore identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk 

our results of operations depend upon the performance of our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our banking subsidiary and other subsidiaries the parent receives substantially all of its revenues from dividends from its subsidiaries and primarily from its subsidiary bank these dividends are a principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt we and certain of our subsidiaries experienced periods of unprofitability or reduced profitability during the most recent recession of 20072009 the ability of the company and its subsidiary bank to pay dividends is restricted by regulatory requirements including profitability and the need to maintain required levels of capital lack of profitability or reduced profitability exposes us to the risk that regulators could restrict the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends it also increases the risk that the company may have to establish a “valuation allowance” against its net dta or have that asset disallowed for regulatory capital purposes 

the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends or make other payments to us is also limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general regulatory restrictions on its dividends if it does not satisfy these regulatory requirements we may be unable to pay dividends or interest on our indebtedness the occ the primary 

regulator of our subsidiary bank has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks to pay dividends only out of current earnings in addition if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which could include the payment of dividends such authority may take actions requiring that such bank refrain from the practice payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if a subsidiary bank were to become “undercapitalized” for purposes of the applicable federal regulatory “prompt corrective action” regulations 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

as of december 31 2016  the company had 1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to amegy cbt and zions bank if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value the company may have to take a charge related to the impairment of its goodwill such a charge would occur if the company were to experience increases in the book value of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in the fair value of equity of a reporting unit a significant decline in the company’s expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the company’s common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein may necessitate the company taking charges in the future related to the impairment of its goodwill future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of the appropriateness of the goodwill carrying value if the company was to conclude that a future writedown of its goodwill is necessary it would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company may not be able to utilize the significant dta recorded on its balance sheet 

the company’s balance sheet includes a significant dta the largest components of this asset result from additions to our alll for purposes of generally accepted accounting principles in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes our ability to continue to record this dta is dependent on the company’s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital in addition inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations currently no dtas are disallowed for regulatory purposes either on a consolidated basis or at the company’s subsidiary bank 

legalcompliance risks 

the doddfrank act imposes significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank act has material implications for the company and the entire financial services industry the doddfrank act places significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions particularly those with more than 50 billion of assets including the company in addition among other things the doddfrank act 



 the company and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel systems consulting and other costs in order to comply with new regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act particularly with respect to stress testing and risk management some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation and clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined individually and collectively regulations adopted under the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the company’s and the financial services industry’s business financial condition including the company’s ability to compete effectively with less regulated financial services providers and results of operations 

other legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and earnings 

in addition to the doddfrank act described previously bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and accordingly we are subject to fdic insurance assessments   

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted however if adopted some of these proposals could adversely affect the company by among other things impacting aftertax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting the company’s ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of the company’s funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that the company could offer and requiring the company to raise capital at inopportune times 

recent political developments including the change in the executive administration of the united states could result in substantial changes in tax international trade immigration and other policies the extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain as are the potential direct and indirect impacts whether beneficial or adverse regulations and laws may be modified or repealed and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be adopted 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings the company’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and increasingly aggressive enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations any   such   matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties including civil money penalties under applicable banking laws injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations including those relating to antimoney laundering matters have been increasing dramatically in addition any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings which may restrict or limit our activities 

reputational risk 

the company is presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational compliance and legal risks 

a reputational risk council was established to monitor manage and develop strategies to effectively manage reputational risk which includes but is not limited to addressing communication logistics legal and regulatory issues

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

this form 10k presents both gaap and nongaap financial measures to provide investors with additional information the adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are presented in the following schedules the company considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons these nongaap financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the company and for presentations of company performance to investors the company further believes that presenting these nongaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities although nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under gaap 

the following are the nongaap financial measures presented in this form 10k and a discussion of why management uses these nongaap measures 

tangible return on average tangible common equity  – this schedule also includes “net earnings applicable to common shareholders excluding the effects of the adjustments net of tax” and “average tangible common equity” tangible return on average tangible common equity is a nongaap financial measure that management believes provides useful information about the company’s use of equity management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income 

tangible equity ratio tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share  – this schedule also includes “tangible equity” “tangible common equity” and “tangible assets” tangible equity ratio tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are nongaap financial measures that management believes provides additional useful information about the levels of tangible assets and tangible equity between each other and in relation to outstanding shares of common stock management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income 

efficiency ratio  – this schedule also includes “adjusted noninterest expense” “taxableequivalent net interest income” “adjusted taxequivalent revenue” and “adjusted preprovision net revenue “ppnr”” the methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies management makes adjustments to exclude certain items as identified in the subsequent schedule which management believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well the company is managing its expenses and adjusted ppnr enables management and others to assess the company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle taxableequivalent net interest income allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and taxexempt sources the efficiency ratio and adjusted noninterest expense are the key metrics to which the company announced it would hold itself accountable in its june 1 2015 efficiency initiative and to which executive compensation is tied we show the efficiency ratio for sixmonth periods in addition to other periods in order to illustrate the trend over time as quarterly fluctuations may not be reflective of the prevailing trend and yearly results may not accurately reflect the pace of change

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and its subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 63 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is considered a “systemically important financial institution” under the doddfrank act 



 results of operations 

executive summary 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2016  of 4113 million  or  199  per diluted common share compared with 2466 million  or 120  per diluted common share for 2015  the improved financial performance reflects revenue growth and tight expense control net income increased in 2016  primarily due to a 1368 million pretax loss recognized from the 2015 sale of the company’s remaining collateralized debt “cdo” portfolio as the company sold these noncore assets this increase was partially offset by a 527 million or 132 increase in the provision for loan losses during 2016 adjusting for the loss on the cdo portfolio net earnings applicable to common shareholders increased by approximately 80 million in 2016 compared with 2015 the increase was driven by higher net interest income due to the company’s redeployment of funds from loweryielding money market investments into higheryielding loans and agency securities coupled with a decrease in interest paid on longterm debt additionally other service charges commissions and fees increased by 208 million or 111 in 2016 these increases improved the company’s operating leverage preprovision net revenue “ppnr” as reported was 8230 million  in 2016 up 614 from 5098 million  in 2015 and adjusted ppnr was 8195 million  up 248 from 6565 million  in 2015 see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 28  for more information regarding the calculation of adjusted ppnr and why management uses this nongaap measure   

performance against previously announced initiatives 

efficiency initiatives 

in june 2015 we announced some major restructuring changes and several key financial targets following are the targeted financial performance outcomes of these organizational changes and associated operational and technological initiatives with some brief comments regarding current performance against these measures 



trend and yearly results may not accurately reflect the pace of change management’s incentive compensation is tied to its efficiency initiative and key profitability metrics elevated third and fourth quarter noninterest expenses directly resulted in management incentive compensation that was less than planned for those quarters in 2016 as previously communicated we are committed to achieving an efficiency ratio in the low 60s in 2017 see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 28  for more information regarding the calculation of the adjusted efficiency ratio and why management uses this nongaap measure 

 our initiatives are designed to make the company a more efficient organization that drives positive operating leverage simplify the corporate structure and operations and improve customer experience the increase in operating leverage is evident through increased revenue from growth in loans deployment of cash to mortgagebacked securities improvement in core fee income and disciplined expense management 

core transformation project update 

we previously announced that we had started a project to replace our core loan and deposit banking systems “core transformation project” the timing of the project implementation has been delayed as a result of other corporate initiatives such as the completion of our banking charter consolidation centralization of loan operations and deposit product simplification we expect to complete the first phase of this threephase project in mid2017 as of december 31 2016 the company had 93 million of capitalized expenses associated with the core transformation project 

risk management actions in 2016 

during 2016 we continued to make significant changes to the company’s balance sheet which contributed to overall changes in its risk profile the restructuring included the following actions 



areas experiencing strength in 2016   

net interest income which is more than threequarters of our revenue improved by 1521 million compared with 2015  the increase in net interest income was due to our efforts to change the mix of interestearning assets from loweryielding money market investments into higheryielding loans and investment securities and our efforts to reduce interest expense related to longterm debt the average investments securities portfolio grew 45 billion compared with 2015 which resulted in an increase of 852 million in taxable equivalent interest income over the same period we also incurred 321 million less in interest expense on longterm debt due to 278 million of redemptions at maturity and the early calls of our remaining trust preferred securities 

some of the same factors that led to an increase in net interest income also helped improve net interest margin “nim” between 2016 and 2015 which was 337 and 319 respectively the yearend increase in the federal funds target rate occurred too late to impact the nim in 2016 but we expect to benefit from this increase in 2017 

adjusted ppnr of 8195 million  in 2016 was up 1630 million from 2015 this increase reflects operating leverage improvement resulting from loan growth a more profitable earning assets mix and controlled core operating expenses ppnr improvements during 2016 have driven an improvement in the company’s efficiency ratio from 704  in 2015 to 658  in 2016 

noninterest income from customerrelated fees increased approximately 7 in 2016 from the prior year period in response to increased company efforts to provide additional value and services to our customers this increase was mainly due to increased credit card transaction volume fees generated on sales of swaps to clients used to hedge interest rate risk and trust and wealth management income 

we successfully completed a tender offer for preferred stock reducing preferred equity by 119 million our 2016 capital plan which runs through the second quarter of 2017 allows for additional redemptions of up to 144 million of our preferred stock through the second quarter of 2017 

areas experiencing challenges in 2016   

net loans and leases increased 20 billion or 49 during 2016 driven largely by increases of 808 million in cre term and 509 million in consumer 14 family residential loans loan growth was strong for the first half of 2016 and although loan production continued during the second half of 2016 increased amounts of paydowns and prepayments resulted in a net increase of only 148 million or an annualized 07 growth rate for the second half of 2016 loan growth was also partially offset by the continued reduction in our national real estate loan portfolio which declined by 335 million during 2016 and a decline of 464 million in our oil and gasrelated loan balances during 2016 

credit quality in our total loan portfolio was generally strong as expected however the credit quality of our oil and gasrelated portfolio deteriorated throughout most of the year in the oil and gasrelated portfolio 66 million of loans were not accruing at december 31 2015 compared with 294 million at december 31 2016 in the fourth quarter of 2016 several credit metrics improved in the oil and gasrelated portfolio including a decrease in nonaccrual loans of 52 million and a decrease in criticized loans of 152 million our total oil and gasrelated credit exposure declined to 39 billion a reduction of approximately 900 million or 19 during 2016 oil and gasrelated loans represented 5 of the total loan portfolio at december 31 2016 

areas of focus for 2017 

in 2017 we are focused on the ongoing initiatives related to company profitability and returns on equity major areas of emphasis include the following

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest portion of our revenue for 2016  taxableequivalent net interest income was 1893 million  compared with 1733 million  and 1696 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35  for all years presented 

net interest margin in 2016  vs 2015 

the nim was 337  and 319  for 2016  and 2015  respectively market trends and competitive pricing have led to generally flat or lower yields across loans and investments in 2016 compared with 2015 these yield adjustments were offset by changes in the company’s asset mix which in 2016 became less concentrated in loweryielding money market investments and more focused on higheryielding agency securities and loans further contributing to the improvement was a decline in the company’s cost of funds due to higher amounts of noninterestbearing deposits and tender offers early calls and maturities of higherrate debt including the remaining trust preferred securities 

our average loan portfolio was 19 billion higher during 2016  compared with 2015  although the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio was 8 bps lower than it was in 2015 due to a continuation of competitive pricing pressure and depressed interest rates the larger average loan base generated an additional 443 million of taxableequivalent interest income during the year the largest average growth in 2016 was in the cre portfolio which also saw the average yield decline by 22 bps the decline in loan yields occurred as new loans were originated or existing loans reset or were modified the steepening of the yield curve that occurred late in 2016 did not have a significant impact on our yearend results but we do expect to see improvement in yields in 2017 on new originations modifications and renewals and when existing variablerate loans reset assuming the rate increases are maintained see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 68  for further information regarding our interest rate sensitivity 

at december 31 2016 and 2015 the carrying value of our purchased creditimpaired “pci” loans from the fdic was 77 million and 125 million respectively the accretion recognized in interest income from these loans was 246 million in 2016 compared with 398 million in 2015 we expect the interest income from these loans will decrease as these balances continue to decline see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the average balance of afs securities for 2016  increased by 44 billion or 843 compared with 2015  and the average yield was flat at 193 average balances of money market investments over the same period declined 46 billion with an average yield during 2016 of 059 the result of the change in asset mix between these two categories of investments improved taxableequivalent interest income by 826 million during 2016 we continued to purchase us agency passthrough securities in order to alter the mix of our interestearning assets that began in the second half of 2014 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided us with low cost funding and comprised 444 of average total deposits for 2016  compared to 439 for 2015  average interestbearing deposit balances increased by 32 in 2016  compared with 2015  additionally the rate paid was flat at 18 bps although we consider a wide variety of sources when determining our funding needs we benefit from access to borrower deposits particularly noninterestbearing deposits that provide us with a low cost of funds and have a positive impact on our nim a significant decrease in the amount of noninterestbearing deposits would likely have a negative impact on our nim 

the average balance of longterm debt was 313 million lower for 2016  compared with 2015  the reduced balance was the result of tender offers early calls and maturities the average interest rate on longterm debt for 2016  decreased by 157 bps compared with 2015  this is due to the maturity of higher cost longterm debt in the latter part of 2015 which had a greater impact on the average rate during 2016 despite 153 million  of longterm debt that will mature in march of 2017 our cost of funding may increase as we continue to increase the size of our balance sheet through the use of wholesale funding but we do not anticipate that this would have a significantly adverse 

effect on the company’s liquidity position for a summary of the tender offers early calls and maturities that occurred during 2016 see note 12   of the notes to consolidated financial statements we continue to look for opportunities to manage down the cost of funds refer to the “liquidity risk management” section beginning on page 72  for more information 

net interest margin in 2015  vs 2014   

the nim was 319  and 326  for 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease resulted primarily from lower yields on loans and reduced interest income from fdicsupported loans the impact of these items was partially offset by lower yields and balances on our longterm debt and a change in the mix of interestearning assets as cash held in money market investments was transitioned to term investment securities 

even though our average loan portfolio was 649 million higher during 2015 compared to 2014 the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio was 18 bps lower than it was in 2014 the resulting decline in interest income was primarily caused by reduced interest income on loans purchased from the fdic in 2009 as those acquired portfolios were successfully managed down and new loans being originated at lower yields than those that prepaid or matured 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 the carrying value of our pci loans from the fdic was 125 million and 179 million respectively the accretion recognized in interest income from these loans was 398 million in 2015 compared with 584 million in 2014 see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the average balance of availableforsale “afs” securities for 2015 increased by 17 billion or 492 compared with 2014 and the average yield in 2015 was 24 bps lower than in 2014 the decline in the average yield and the changes in the average balance are a result of changes in the composition of the afs portfolio and the yields of the securities sold and purchased beginning in the second half of 2014 we started purchasing us agency passthrough securities in order to increase our holdings of hqla and to alter the mix of our interestearning assets these increases were partially offset by cdo sales and paydowns 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided us with low cost funding and comprised 439 of average total deposits for 2015 compared to 424 for 2014 average interestbearing deposit balances increased by 23 in 2015 compared with 2014 additionally the rate paid declined by 1 bps to 18 bps 

the average balance of longterm debt was 790 million lower for 2015 compared to 2014 the reduced balance was the result of tender offers early calls and maturities the average interest rate on longterm debt for 2015 decreased by 8 bps compared to 2014 this is due to the maturity of higher cost longterm debt in the latter part of 2015 on september 15 2015 and november 16 2015 respectively there was 112 million of 60 and 124 million of 55 subordinated and convertible debt notes that matured the total effective cost of this debt was approximately 15 during 2015 the higher effective cost for the debt that matured was due to the amortization of debt discount 

during 2015 most of our cash in excess of that needed to fund earning assets was held in money market investments primarily deposits with the federal reserve bank average money market investments were 152 of total interestearning assets compared with 158 in the prior year 

see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 68  for further discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and the associated risk 

interest rate spreads 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 322  for 2016  and 299  for both 2015  and 2014 the spreads on average interestbearing funds for 2016  and 2015  were affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim 

we expect the mix of interestearning assets to continue to change over the next several quarters due to solid consumer loan growth accompanied by moderate growth in cre term loans and nonoil and gasrelated ci loans we anticipate this growth will be partially offset by continued reduction in the nre and oil and gasrelated portfolios which we expect to decline at a slower rate than in 2016 

we are continuing to invest in shorttomedium duration us agency passthrough securities these investments are reducing the proportion of earning assets in money market investments and increasing the proportion of afs securities we may choose to fund future purchases of these investments without using cash on hand and such purchases would consequently deliver a reduced spread average yields on the loan portfolio may continue to experience modest downward pressure due to competitive pricing and growth in loweryielding residential mortgages however we expect average yields on the loan portfolio to benefit from recent rate rises 

we expect to remain “assetsensitive” which refers to net interest income increasing as a result of a rising interest rate environment with regard to interest rate risk in response to liquidity management and liquidity stresstesting regulations which elevate relative to historic levels the proportion of hqla we are required to hold in the second half of 2014 we began deploying cash into shorttomedium duration us agency passthrough securities during 2016 we purchased hqla securities of 70 billion at amortized cost increasing hqla securities by 50 billion after paydowns and payoffs during the year in the first quarter of 2017 we expect to continue to purchase securities at a similar pace to the purchases in the fourth quarter of 2016 at which point we will be near our targeted balance for the investment securities portfolio these purchases are expected to somewhat reduce our asset sensitivity compared with previous periods 

our estimates of the company’s actual interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes in addition our modeled projections for noninterestbearing demand deposits which are a substantial portion of our deposit balances are particularly reliant on assumptions for which there is little historical experience due to the prolonged period of very low interest rates further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate risk” on page 68

provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the alll at an adequate level based on the inherent risks in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments “rulc” at an adequate level based on the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the alll and rulc we perform periodic evaluations of our various loan portfolios the levels of actual charge 

offs credit trends and external factors see note 6   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 55  for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

the provision for loan losses was 928 million in 2016 compared with 400 million in 2015 the 528 million increase in provision for loan losses during 2016 is due to incurred losses in the oil and gasrelated portfolio net chargeoffs for the total loan portfolio were 131 million in 2016 compared with 39 million in 2015 only 1 million of 2016 net chargeoffs were attributed to loans outside of the oil and gasrelated portfolio 

the credit quality for the total loan portfolio experienced some deterioration during 2016 as expected the credit quality for the oil and gasrelated portfolio which represents 5 of our total loan portfolio declined during 2016 however we did experience improvements in credit quality metrics in this portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2016 see “oil and gasrelated exposure” on page 57  and “nonperforming assets” on page 64  for more information on the credit quality of our oil and gasrelated and total loan portfolios respectively 

the provision for unfunded lending commitments was 99 million in 2016 compared with 62 million in 2015 the negative provision in 2016 is primarily due to improved credit quality assessments related to these obligations for credits outside the oil and gasrelated portfolio along with declining oil and gasrelated exposure from quarter to quarter the provision for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations fundings and changes in credit quality 

the allowance for credit losses “acl” which is the combination of both the alll and the rulc decreased by 48 million during 2016 declines in credit quality and increased chargeoffs in the oil and gasrelated portfolio were more than offset by improvements in the rest of the loan portfolio further declining oil and gasrelated exposure and increasing residential real estate and cre term exposure improved the risk profile of the portfolio 

the net chargeoffs experienced in nonoil and gasrelated loans 95 of total loans were only 1 million in 2016 we believe that such levels of net chargeoffs are unlikely to persist in future periods although the level of nonoil and gasrelated problem loans is not currently experiencing meaningful deterioration or negative migration due to active balance sheet management by our oil and gasrelated borrowers and increases in oil and gas prices the credit quality of this portfolio improved during the fourth quarter of 2016 and we expect oil and gas net chargeoffs to decline in 2017 compared with 2016 as a result of the expected increase of net chargeoffs in the nonoil and gasrelated portfolio and the improvements in the oil and gasrelated loan portfolio we expect the provision for loan losses in 2017 to be consistent with the provision recorded in 2016 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield for 2016  noninterest income was  5156 million  compared with  3572 million  in 2015  and  4927 million  in 2014  we believe a subtotal of customerrelated fees provides a better view of income over which we have more direct control it excludes items such as dividends insurancerelated income marktomarket adjustments on certain derivatives and securities gains or losses customerrelated fees increased to 4735 million from 4429 million in 2015 and 4287 million in 2014 the growth of 105 in two years is the result of increased focus to better evaluate the needs of customers and provide services that match those needs in late 2014 and early 2015 we created a chief banking officer position that oversees many of the feebased businesses added an executive director of enterprise retail banking for the organization to augment the existing structure of retail banking leaders at each of our affiliates created a position for the director of fee income strategies which has substantially enhanced the reporting information systems and accountability of various executives and overhauled our approach to wealth management with new executives and substantial hiring of wealth advisors 

during 2016 much of the success in the customerrelated fee income area is attributable to improved utilization of our cash management services substantially improved usage of corporate and retail credit and debit cards increased loan fees due in part to increased loan generation improved sales of interest rate swaps to customers who are wishing to reduce interest rate risk for their own companies and solid improvement in wealth managementrelated income 

schedule 8  presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

schedule 8   

noninterest income 



other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of atm fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit and credit card interchange fees cash management fees and other miscellaneous fees increased by 208 million compared with 2015 the main increases relate to higher credit card interchange fees fees generated on sales of interest rate swaps to clients and exchange and other fees in 2015 other service charges commissions and fees increased by 88 million compared with 2014 the increase was primarily a result of higher interchange fees and fees generated on sales of swaps to clients partially offset by a decline in loan fees 

during the first quarter of 2016 we reclassified bankcard rewards expense from noninterest expense into noninterest income in order to offset the associated revenue interchange fees to align with industry practice this reclassification within other service charges commission and fees lowered noninterest income in the first quarter of 2016 and also decreased other noninterest expense by the same amount for comparative purposes we also reclassified prior period amounts this reclassification had no impact on net income 

wealth management income increased by 62 million most of the change was due to trust income with improvement in both corporate and personal trust revenue due to platform and product simplifications wealth management income was flat between 2015 and 2014 increasing only 06 million or 20 

dividends and other investment income declined by 61 million in 2016 compared with 2015 this was primarily due to consolidating seven banking charters into one our stock ownership with the federal home loan bank “fhlb” system has consequently decreased significantly since december 31 2015 we expected a 7 million annual decline in fhlb dividends though only 5 million in 2016 was realized due to the timing of the stock redemptions the consolidation also caused an increase in the company’s ownership of federal reserve stock however lower dividends on this stock created a further decline in dividend income we expect these lower levels to persist through 2017 in 2015 dividends and other investment income declined by 135 million compared with 2014 as a result of writedowns on certain peis 

loan sales and servicing income increased 48 million or 156 compared with 2015 the main driver for this increase was positive valuation adjustments on certain servicing rights loan sales and servicing income increased by 16 million or 55 in 2015 compared with 2014 but was still lower when compared to prior periods as the company continued to retain more of its residential mortgage loan production than it had done in previous years 

in 2016 we had only 100 thousand of net gains on fixed income securities gains in some quarters were offset by losses in others in 2015 we recorded a fixed income securities loss of 1387 million compared with a gain of 104 million in 2014 during the second quarter of 2015 we sold the remaining portfolio of our cdo securities or 574 

million at amortized cost and realized net losses of 137 million the fixed income securities gain of 104 million in 2014 was primarily from paydowns and payoffs of the cdo securities 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense increased by 47 million or 03 to 15853 million  in 2016  compared with 15806 million  in 2015  and  16494 million  in 2014  expenses were essentially flat due to continued efforts to control expenses which were partially offset by increased investment into the company’s technology initiatives increased fdic premiums and increased costs in the company’s benefit plans 

schedule 9  presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

schedule 9   

noninterest expense 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 98 million or 10 in 2016 compared with 2015 as illustrated in schedule 10  base salaries were flat between the years although we had over 6 million less in severance expense in 2016 major systems projects led to continued headcount increases in more highly compensated roles than those where reductions have occurred bonus expense increased because specific employees met targets in company approved defined plans although elevated third and fourth quarter noninterest expenses directly resulted in management incentive compensation that was less than planned for those quarters in 2016 employee benefits expense increased in 2016 due to higher costs in the company’s selffunded medical plans as well as higher than expected retirement expense due to several large lumpsum payouts during the year salaries and employee benefits increased by 17 in 2015 compared with 2014 due to similar reasons to those in 2016 management’s incentive compensation is tied to its efficiency initiative and key profitability metrics 

schedule 10   

salaries and employee benefits 



occupancy expense increased 58 million or 49 in 2016 compared with 2015 the increase was due to a combination of small items including higher rent expense lease depreciation and building security occupancy expense increased 38 million in 2015 compared with 2014 

fdic premiums increased by 53 million or 154 in 2016 compared with 2015 due to a higher deposit base and the surcharge introduced by the fdic in 2016 the fdic approved a change in deposit insurance assessments due to the doddfrank act the increased premiums were effective for the last six months of 2016 though this has been somewhat offset by a reduction in the company’s overall rate resulting from the consolidation of the individual bank charters and attempts to lower the risk profile of the bank premiums increased by 22 million or 68 in 2015 compared with 2014 

other noninterest expense decreased by 81 million in 2016 compared with 2015 and by 435 million in 2015 compared with 2014 the change was driven primarily by lower legal expenses and lower writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset as the balance of fdicsupported loans continues to decline in 2015 the decrease from 2014 was caused by both the fdic asset changes and an increased amount of insurance recoveries over the prior year please refer to our previous discussion in the noninterest income section around bankcard rewards reclassification activities in the first quarter of 2016 for additional explanation of changes in this line item 

in 2016 we held adjusted noninterest expense below 158 billion and we expect an increase of between 2 and 3 in 2017 the expense items we exclude from noninterest expense to arrive at adjusted noninterest expense are the same as those excluded in arriving at the efficiency ratio see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 28  for more information regarding the calculation of the efficiency ratio 

income taxes 

income tax expense was  2359 million  in 2016   1424 million  in 2015  and  2230 million  in 2014  our effective income tax rates including the effects of noncontrolling interests were 335 in 2016  315 in 2015  and 359 in 2014  the tax expense rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance further the tax rate in 2015 decreased significantly as a result of the company’s investments in alternative energy and technology initiatives the company continued to invest in technology initiatives and increased investment in municipal securities during 2016 generating tax credits and nontaxable income that benefited the tax rate 

we had a net dta balance of 250 million at december 31 2016  compared with 203 million at december 31 2015  the increase in the net dta resulted primarily from items related to fair value adjustments on securities and a decrease in the deferred tax liabilities related to the debt exchange from 2009 

we did not record any additional valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2016  see note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 81  for additional information 

preferred stock dividends and redemption 

in 2016  we incurred preferred stock dividends of 480 million a decrease of 149 million from 2015  in 2015  we incurred preferred stock dividends of 629 million a decrease of 90 million from 2014  we completed a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2015 to purchase 176 million of our series i preferred stock we also completed a tender offer in the second quarter of 2016 to purchase 119 million of preferred stock as a result of the preferred stock redemption in 2016 preferred dividends are expected to be 104 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 124 million for the second quarter of 2017 our preferred stock may decrease further if we redeem 144 million of preferred equity as authorized by our 2016 capital plan see further details in note 13  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

business segment results 

following the close of business on december 31 2015 we completed the merger of our subsidiary banks with zions first national bank subsequently zions first national bank changed its legal name to zb national association we continue to manage our banking operations under our existing brand names and business segments including zions bank amegy bank california bank  trust national bank of arizona nevada state bank vectra bank colorado and the commerce bank of washington performance assessment and resource allocation are based upon this geographical structure 

as discussed in the “executive summary” on page 31  most of the lending and other decisions affecting customers are made at the local level the accounting policies of the individual segments are the same as those of the company we allocate the cost of centrally provided services to the business segments based upon estimated or actual usage of those services due to the charter consolidation we have moved to an internal funds transfer pricing “ftp” allocation system to report results of operations for business segments this process continues to be refined 

the operating segment identified as “other” includes the parent zions management services company which was merged into zions first national bank on december 31 2015 certain nonbank financial service subsidiaries and eliminations of transactions between segments due to the ongoing centralization of backoffice functions that continued throughout 2016 a higher level of expenses than normal was retained in the other segment the parent’s operations are significant to the other segment the company’s net interest income is substantially affected by the parent’s interest expense on longterm debt the parent’s financial statements in note 23  provide more information about the parent’s activities 

the condensed statement of income identifies the components of income and expense which affect the operating amounts presented in the other segment total loans and deposits presented for the banking segments do not include intercompany amounts between banking segments but may include deposits with the other segment prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect these changes note 21  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains selected information from the respective balance sheets and statements of income for all segments 

during 2016 our banking operations experienced improved financial performance common areas of financial performance experienced at various levels of the segments include

selected segment information 





zions bank 

zions bank is headquartered in salt lake city utah and is primarily responsible for conducting operations in utah idaho and wyoming if it were a separately chartered bank it would be the 2nd largest fullservice commercial bank in utah and the 3rd largest in idaho as measured by domestic deposits in these states   

within zions bank the national real estate group is a wholesale business that generally sources loans from other community banks across the country such loans are generally low loantovalue owneroccupied loans but also include nonowneroccupied cre term loans 

zions bank’s income before income taxes increased by 656 million or 190 during 2016 primarily as a result of increases in other noninterest income and decreases in other noninterest expense the loan portfolio increased by 328 million during 2016 which consisted of increases of 159 million in commercial loans 49 million in cre loans and 120 million in consumer loans while commercial owneroccupied loans decreased by 164 million the decline in commercial owneroccupied loans was mainly the result of a reduction in the national real estate loan portfolio the ratio of allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases decreased to 115 at december 31 2016 from 147 at december 31 2015 nonperforming lendingrelated assets declined 36 from the prior year due primarily to decreases in nonaccrual loans in the commercial and industrial and commercial owneroccupied portfolios deposits at december 31 2016 were 33 higher than at december 31 2015 

amegy bank 

amegy bank is headquartered in houston texas if it were a separately chartered bank it would be the 9 th  largest fullservice commercial bank in texas as measured by domestic deposits in the state 

amegy’s income before income taxes decreased by 101 million or 77 during 2016 the decline in income before income taxes is mainly due to a 717 million increase in the provision for loan losses primarily for its oil and gasrelated loans see schedule 20  and discussion of our “oil and gasrelated exposure” on page 57  for more information despite the decline in the oil and gasrelated portfolio amegy has been able to achieve loan portfolio growth resulting in a 441 million increase from the prior year during 2016 commercial loans decreased by 169 million and cre loans and consumer loans increased by 203 million and 407 million respectively as a result of the oil and gasrelated exposure the credit quality of amegy’s loan portfolio declined during 2016 and the ratio of alll net loans and leases increased to 249 at december 31 2016 from 220 a year earlier during 2016 nonperforming lendingrelated assets increased 244 million or 2109 deposits decreased by 21 from 2015 to 2016

noninterest expenses that are more consistent with historical levels going forward the major components at the parent include net interest income which includes interest expense on other borrowed funds net impairment losses on investment securities and losses from the sale of the remaining cdo portfolio 

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases 

schedule 6    which we referenced in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of our interestearning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another goal is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets such as money market investments or securities while maintaining adequate levels of highlyliquid assets as a result of slower economic growth accompanied by moderate loan demand in previous periods the company’s initiative to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets caused us to deploy excess funds into security purchases and redemptions of longterm debt 

average interestearning assets were 562 billion  in 2016  compared with 544 billion  in the previous year average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 935  in 2016  and 937  in 2015  

average loans were 421 billion  in 2016  and 402 billion  in 2015  average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 700  in 2016  compared with 692  in 2015  

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold and security resell agreements decreased  by 556  to 37 billion  in 2016  compared with 83 billion  in 2015  average securities increased  by 769  from 2015  average total deposits increased  by 40  while average total loans increased  by 47  in 2016  when compared with 2015

investment securities portfolio 

we invest in securities to manage liquidity and interest rate risk in addition to generating revenues for the company refer to the “liquidity risk management” section on page 72  for additional information on management of liquidity and funding and compliance with basel iii and lcr requirements the following schedule presents a profile of our investment securities portfolio the amortized cost amounts represent the original cost of the investments adjusted for related accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments and for impairment losses including creditrelated impairment the estimated fair value measurement levels and methodology are discussed in note 20   of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedule 12   

investment securities portfolio 



the amortized cost of investment securities at december 31 2016  increased by 751 from the balance at december 31 2015  primarily due to purchases of agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities there were additional increases in agency securities and sba loanbacked securities 

the investment securities portfolio includes 606 million of net premium primarily from sba loanbacked securities and agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities recent purchases of these securities have occurred at a premium to the respective par amount the purchase premiums and discounts for both heldtomaturity “htm” and afs securities are amortized and accreted at a constant effective yield to the contractual maturity date and no assumption is made concerning prepayments as principal prepayments occur the portion of the unamortized premium or discount associated with the principal reduction is recognized as interest income in the period the principal is reduced premium amortization for 2016  was approximately 99 million compared with approximately 51 million in 2015  and is included in portfolio yields the increased premium amortization is due to both an increased amount of agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities and sba loanbacked securities and changes in actual prepayment rates of the underlying loans 

as of december 31 2016  under the gaap fair value accounting hierarchy 14 of the 134 billion fair value of the afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 986 was valued at level 2 and there were no level 3 afs securities at december 31 2015  08 of the 76 billion fair value of afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 992 was valued at level 2 and there were no level 3 afs securities see note 20  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value accounting

exposure to state and local governments 

we provide multiple products and services to state and local governments collectively referred to as “municipalities” including deposit services loans and investment banking services and we invest in securities issued by the municipalities 

schedule 14  summarizes the company’s exposure to state and local municipalities 

schedule 14   

municipalities 



at december 31 2016  one municipal loan with a balance of 1 million was on nonaccrual a significant amount of the municipal loan and lease portfolio is secured by real estate and equipment and 91 of the outstanding credits were originated by cbt zions bank vectra and amegy see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans 

growth in municipal exposures came primarily from increases in the municipal afs securities portfolio consistent with the company’s initiative to increase securities afs securities generally consist of securities with investment graderatings from one or more major credit rating agencies htm securities consist of unrated bonds issued by small local government entities prior to purchase the issuers of municipal securities are evaluated by the company for their creditworthiness and some of the securities are guaranteed by third parties 

foreign exposure and operations 

our credit exposure to foreign sovereign risks and total foreign credit exposure is not significant we also do not have significant foreign exposure to derivative counterparties we had no foreign deposits at december 31 2016  compared with 294 million  at december 31 2015  during 2016 we closed our branch in grand cayman grand cayman islands bwi and no longer have foreign operations 

loans held for sale 

loans held for sale consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market were 172 million  at december 31 2016  compared with 150 million  at december 31 2015  these consumer loans are primarily fixedrate mortgages that are originated with the intent to be sold to third parties 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2016  net loans and leases accounted for 674 of total assets compared with 681 at the end of 2015  schedule 15  presents our loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2016  however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in a small number of cases we have hedged the repricing characteristics of our variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 68  

schedule 15   

loan portfolio by type and maturity 



as of december 31 2016 net loans and leases were  426 billion  reflecting a 49 increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations and loan purchases 

loan portfolio growth during 2016 was widespread across loan products and geography with particular strength in   commercial and industrial nonoil and gas cre term 14 family residential and home equity credit line loans “hecl” the growth in the loan portfolio was primarily at cbt amegy nbaz and zions bank during the second quarter of 2016 the company purchased 104 million of 14 family residential loans the impact of these increases was partially offset by declines in commercial owneroccupied loans 

of the significant increases within the portfolio commercial and industrial nonoil and gas loans increased approximately 241 million cre term loans increased 808 million and 14 family residential loans increased 509 million due largely to an increase in loan production 

commercial owneroccupied loans declined approximately 188 million during 2016 and 202 million during 2015 due to the reduction of the national real estate portfolio at zions bank though these declines are not expected to continue at the same pace in 2017 the national real estate business is a wholesale business that depends upon loan referrals from other community banking institutions due to generally soft loan demand nationally many community banking institutions are retaining rather than selling their loan production 

we expect slighttomoderate overall loan and lease growth during 2017 primarily in commercial and industrial nonoil and gas loans cre term and consumer 14 family residential partially offset by continued reduction from the national real estate and oil and gasrelated loan portfolios we also expect to continue to limit 

construction and land development loan commitment growth for the foreseeable future as part of management’s actions to improve the risk profile of the company and to reduce portfolio concentration risk 

loans serviced for the benefit of others increased to 35 billion during 2016 from 34 billion in 2015 

other noninterestbearing investments 

as part of our initiative to consolidate our charters into a single charter the company has shares in a single fhlb des moines historically each affiliate bank held shares in different fhlbs but all stock in the other fhlbs has been redeemed our investment balance in federal reserve stock is expected to remain relatively stable from where it currently sits at december 31 2016 the 58 million increase is because several formerly statechartered banks were not required to hold stock with the frb following consolidation the capital requirements for zb na increased schedule 16  sets forth our other noninterestbearing investments

other noninterestbearing investments 



premises equipment and software net 

premises equipment and software net increased 114 million  or 126  from the prior year primarily due to an increase of 85 million  in buildings and 59 million  in software partially offset by an increase in depreciation of 28 million  the capitalized costs associated with buildings were primarily from the development of a new corporate facility for amegy in texas the increase in software was mainly due to the capitalization of eligible costs related to the development of new lending deposit and reporting systems 

deposits 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company average total deposits increased  by 40  during 2016  with average interestbearing deposits increasing  by 32  and average noninterestbearing deposits increasing   51  the average interest rate paid for interestbearing deposits did not change in 2016  compared with 2015  

deposits at december 31 2016  excluding time deposits of 100000 and over and brokered deposits increased by 43 or 21 billion from december 31 2015  the increase was mainly due to an increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits and interestbearing domestic savings and money market offset by a decrease in time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits 

demand and savings and money market deposits were 948 and 952 of total deposits at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively in the normal course of business we utilize brokered deposits for our deposit funding mix at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  total deposits included 940 million and 119 million respectively of brokered deposits 

see notes 11  and 12   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity risk management” on page 72  for additional information on funding and borrowed funds 

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of our operations management of risk is an integral part of our operations and is also a key determinant of our overall performance the board of directors has appointed a risk oversight committee “roc” that consists of appointed board members who oversee the company’s risk management processes the roc meets on a regular basis to monitor and review enterprise risk management “erm” activities as required by its charter the roc performs oversight for various erm activities and approves erm policies and activities as detailed in the roc charter 

management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks these risks are overseen by the various management committees of which the ermc is the focal point for the monitoring and review of enterprise risk 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

the board of directors through the roc is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the credit risk of the company in addition the roc oversees and monitors adherence to key policies and the credit risk appetite which is defined in the risk appetite framework additionally the board has established the credit administration committee chaired by the chief credit officer and consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk for the company and approving 

changes to the company’s credit policies 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit risk management and credit examination functions we separate the lending function from the credit risk management function which strengthens control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities formal credit policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level in addition we have a welldefined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio and we utilize a comprehensive loan risk grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore the internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments and credit activities these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan risk grading administration and compliance with credit policies new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the new initiative review committee 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally emphasis is placed on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio we attempt to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty generally our loan portfolio is well diversified however due to the nature of our geographical footprint there are certain significant concentrations primarily in cre and oil and gasrelated lending we have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending leveraged lending municipal lending and oil and gasrelated lending all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary the recent growth in construction and land development loan commitments is within the established concentration limits our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographical footprint of our banking affiliates 

as we continue to monitor our concentration risk we note the composition of our loan portfolio has slightly changed oil and gasrelated loans represent 5 of the total loan portfolio at december 31 2016 compared with 6 at december 31 2015 and total commercial loans are 506 of the total portfolio compared with 529 for the 

same periods consumer loans have grown to represent 228 of the total loan portfolio at december 31 2016 compared with 216 at december 31 2015 

the credit quality of our total loan portfolio experienced some deterioration during 2016 primarily due to the oil and gasrelated loan portfolio nonperforming lendingrelated assets at december 31 2016 increased by approximately 605 from december 31 2015 gross chargeoffs for 2016 increased to 197 million from 139 million in 2015 and net chargeoffs increased to 131 million from 39 million for the same periods 

as displayed in schedule 17  commercial and industrial loans were the largest category and constituted 315 of our loan portfolio at december 31 2016 commercial owneroccupied loans decreased to 163 of total loans at december 31 2016 compared with 176 at december 31 2015

 oil and gasrelated exposure 

various industries represented in the previous schedule contain certain loans we categorized as oil and gasrelated including mining quarrying and oil and gas extraction manufacturing and transportation and warehousing at december 31 2016 and 2015 we had approximately 39 billion and 48 billion of total oil and gasrelated credit exposure respectively the distribution of oil and gasrelated loans by customer market segment is shown in schedule 20  

schedule 20   

oil and gasrelated exposure 1   





 during 2016 our balance of oil and gasrelated loans decreased approximately 464 million or 177 to 22 billion primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns exploration and production loan balances decreased 103 and oil and gas services loan balances declined 356 unfunded oil and gasrelated lending commitments declined by 429 million or 199 the decline in oil and gasrelated credit exposure during 2016 was consistent with expectations and further reduction is likely over the next several quarters but it is not expected to continue at the same pace in 2017 

at december 31 2016 approximately 294 million or 136 of the oil and gasrelated loan balances were nonaccruing compared with approximately 66 million or 25 at december 31 2015 861 of oil and gasrelated nonaccruing loans were current as to principal and interest payments at december 31 2016 significantly up from 712 at december 31 2015 

classified oil and gasrelated credits increased to 681 million at december 31 2016 from 517 million at december 31 2015 oil and gasrelated loan net chargeoffs were 130 million for 2016 compared with 43 million for 2015 the majority of the net chargeoffs and loan downgrades during 2016 reflected deterioration in the financial condition of companies primarily in the oilfield services and exploration and production portfolios 

upstream 

upstream exploration and production loans comprised approximately 34 and 31 of the oil and gasrelated loans at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively many upstream borrowers have relatively balanced production between oil and gas 

we use disciplined underwriting practices to mitigate the risk associated with upstream lending activities upstream loans are made to reservebased borrowers where approximately 90 of those loans are collateralized by the value of the borrower’s oil and gas reserves our oil and gas price deck the pricing applied to a borrower’s reserves for underwriting purposes has generally been below the nymex strip ie the average of the daily settlement prices of the next 12 months’ futures contracts through the use of independent and third party engineers and conservative underwriting we apply multiple discounts these discounts often range from 1040 of the value of the collateral in determining the borrowing base commitment and help protect credit quality against significant commodity price declines further reservebased commitments are subject to a borrowing base redetermination based on thencurrent energy prices typically every six months generally we have at our option the right to conduct additional redeterminations during the year borrowing bases for clients are usually set at 6070 of available collateral after an adjustment for the discounts described above   

upstream borrowers generally do not draw the maximum available funding on their lines which provides the borrower additional liquidity and flexibility the line utilization rate for upstream borrowers was approximately 59 and 57 at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively this unused commitment gives us the ability in some cases to reduce the borrowing base commitment through the redetermination process without creating a borrowing base deficiency where outstanding debt exceeds the new borrowing base nevertheless our loan agreements generally require the borrowers to maintain a certain amount of equity therefore if the loantocollateral value exceeds an acceptable limit we work with the borrowers to reinstate an acceptable collateralvalue threshold 

an additional metric we consider in our underwriting is a borrower’s oil and gas price hedging practices a considerable portion of our reservebased borrowers are hedged as of december 31 2016 of the upstream borrower’s riskbased estimated oil production and gas production projected in 2017 42 and 68 respectively is hedged based on the latest data provided by the borrowers 

midstream 

midstream marketing and transportation loans comprised approximately 28 and 23 of the oil and gasrelated exposure at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively loans in this segment are made to companies that gather transport treat and blend oil and natural gas or that provide services to similar companies the assets owned by these borrowers which make this activity possible are fieldlevel gathering systems small diameter pipe pipelines mediumlarge diameter pipe tanks trucks rail cars various waterbased vessels and natural gas treatment plants our midstream loans are secured by these assets unless the borrower is rated investmentgrade a significant portion of our midstream borrowers’ revenues are derived from feebased contracts giving them limited exposure to commodity price risk since lower oil and gas prices slow the drilling and development of new oil and natural gas but do not normally result in significant numbers of producing wells being shut in volumes of oil and gas flowing through midstream systems usually remain relatively stable throughout oil and natural gas price cycles 

oil and gas services 

oil and gas services loans which include oilfield services and oil and gas service manufacturing comprised approximately 30 and 39 of the oil and gasrelated exposure at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively oil and gas services loans include borrowers that have a concentration of revenues in the energy industry however many of these borrowers provide a broad range of products and services to the oil and gas industry and are not subject to the same volatility as new drilling activities many of these borrowers are diversified geographically and service both oil and gasrelated drilling and production 

for oil and gas services loans underwriting criteria require lower leverage to compensate for the cyclical nature of the industry during the underwriting process we use sensitivity analysis to consider revenue and cash flow impacts resulting from oil and gas price cycles 

risk management of the oil and gasrelated portfolio 

we apply concentration limits and disciplined underwriting to the entire oil and gasrelated loan portfolio to limit our risk exposure as an indicator of the diversity in the size of our oil and gasrelated portfolio the average amount 

of our commitments is approximately 6 million with approximately 68 of the commitments less than 30 million additionally there are instances where we have commitments to a common sponsor which when combined would result in higher commitment levels than 30 million the portfolio contains only senior loans – no junior or second lien positions additionally we cautiously approach making firstlien loans to borrowers that employ excessive leverage through the use of junior lien loans or unsecured layers of debt approximately 90 of the total oil and gasrelated portfolio is secured by reserves equipment real estate and other collateral or a combination of collateral types 

we participate as a lender in loans and commitments designated as shared national credits “sncs” which generally consist of larger and more diversified borrowers that have better access to capital markets sncs are loans or loan commitments of at least 20 million that are shared by three or more federally supervised institutions the percentage of sncs is approximately 79 of the upstream portfolio 81 of the midstream portfolio and 46 of the energy services portfolio our bankers have direct access and contact with the management of these snc borrowers and as such are active participants in many cases we provide ancillary banking services to these borrowers further evidencing this direct relationship the results of the 2016 shared national credit exams are reflected in our financial statements 

as a secondary source of support many of our oil and gasrelated borrowers have access to capital markets and private equity sources private sponsors tend to be large funds often with assets under management of more than 1 billion managed by individuals with a great deal of oil and gas expertise and experience and who have successfully managed investments through previous energy price cycles the investors in the funds are primarily institutional investors such as large pensions foundations trusts and high net worth family offices 

when establishing the level of the acl we consider multiple factors including reduced drilling activity and additional capital raises by borrowers and their sponsors during 2016 we increased the acl on the oil and gasrelated portfolio by approximately 47 million which now represents 90 of the oil and gasrelated portfolio primarily due to low energy prices which contributed to an increased provision for loan losses in 2016 although we experienced favorable credit quality trends in the fourth quarter of 2016 we expect continued net chargeoffs in the oil and gasrelated portfolio primarily from the oil and gas services companies 

commercial real estate loans 

selected information indicative of credit quality regarding our cre loan portfolio is presented in schedule 21  

schedule 21   

commercial real estate portfolio by loan type and collateral location 

at december 31 2016 





approximately 23 of the cre term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2016 for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to seven years the remaining 77 of cre loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project loantovalue ratio and occupancy rates   

approximately 147 million or 12 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2016 consists of acquisition and development loans these loans are generally secured by land held for or in the process of development as commercial properties 

underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements required equity infusions upon a decline in value of the collateral are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily and hospitality construction projects we require substantial preleasingleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan significant consideration is given to the likely market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independent of the loan officer and the borrower generally by our internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed a new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness 

advance rates ie loan commitments will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and homes not under contract and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally loanbyloan reviews of passgrade loans for all commercial and residential construction and land development loans are performed semiannually at all affiliates except tcbw which performs such reviews annually 

the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing cre loans for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes into consideration this repayment source 

when we modify or extend a loan we give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether we have granted a concession in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was 

granted and impairment exists however if additional collateral is obtained or if a strong guarantor exists who is believed to be able and willing to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation performance of other related projects with which we are familiar and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared to the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

a continuation of low oil and gas prices could potentially produce an adverse impact on our cre loan portfolio within texas however based upon generally strong equity and cash flow coverage levels and sponsor support for the various properties we do not expect a material amount of losses within this portfolio in 2017 our largest cre credit exposures in texas are to the multifamily office and retail sectors at december 31 2016 approximately 55 of our cre credit exposure in texas is located in houston and the cre loan portfolio mix in texas is 68 commercial term 19 commercial construction 10 residential construction and 3 land development 

consumer loans 

we have mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality we generally hold variablerate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixedrate loans to third parties including federal national mortagage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards 

we are engaged in hecl lending at december 31 2016 and 2015 our hecl portfolio totaled 26 billion and 24 billion respectively schedule 22  shows the composition of our hecl portfolio by lien status 

schedule 22   

hecl portfolio by lien status 



as of december 31 2016 loans representing approximately 1 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateralvalue at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination 

approximately 94 of our hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 27 is scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years we regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates the analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment the ratio of net chargeoffs to average balances at yearend 2016 and 2015 for the hecl portfolio was 001 and 002 respectively see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit quality of this portfolio 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming lendingrelated assets as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned “oreo” increased to 134 at december 31 2016 compared with 087 at december 31 2015 

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2016 increased by 219 million from the prior year primarily due to deterioration in the oil and gasrelated portfolio however nonaccrual loans declined in the 14 family residential and cre term loan categories the largest total decreases in nonaccrual loans occurred at nbaz and vectra 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” on page 65  for more information company policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to cre term loans see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

 restructured loans 

troubled debt restructuring “tdr” are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties and for which we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider tdrs declined 155 during 2016 primarily due to payments and payoffs commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such consumer loan tdrs may include firstlien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether or not a loan should be returned to accrual status 

schedule 24   

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 



in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs

allowance for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the alll we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance our loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type schedule 26  shows the changes in the alll and a summary of loan loss experience 

schedule 26   

summary of loan loss experience 



schedule 27  provides a breakdown of the alll and the allocation among the portfolio segments 

schedule 27   

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 



the total alll decreased by 38 million during 2016 due to continued strong credit quality for the total portfolio in addition to a change in the portfolio mix as oil and gasrelated exposures declined and residential real estate and cre term exposures increased this decrease was partially offset by continued weaknesses in the oil and gasrelated industry 

the total alll remained relatively unchanged during 2015 due to deterioration within the oil and gasrelated portfolio which was offset by improvements in credit quality metrics outside of the oil and gasrelated portfolio however during 2015 we increased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to account for the increased risk of loss on loans affected by the declines in oil and natural gas prices that occurred during the year 

the rulc represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is separately shown in our balance sheet and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are shown separately in the statement of income the reserve decreased by 99 million during 2016 primarily due to improved credit quality assessments related to these obligations outside the oil and gasrelated portfolio in addition to declining oil and gasrelated exposure 

see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acl and credit trends experienced in each portfolio segment 

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company including interest rate and market risk management in addition the board establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews limit exceptions reported by management the board has established the assetliability committee “alco” consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the company alco is primarily responsible for managing interest rate and market risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to manage balance sheet sensitivity to reduce net income volatility due to changes in interest rates 

previously we have noted that there has been limited sensitivity to falling rates due to the low level of rates and we have tended to operate near interest rate risk “triggers” and appetites to be appropriately positioned in light of these market conditions however rising rates during the fourth quarter of 2016 have increased the sensitivity to falling rates as they now have further to fall furthermore market participants have recently contemplated the possibility of negative rates in the us markets which would likely have a more negative impact on the nim in order to mitigate this pressure we have been deploying cash into shorttomedium duration agency passthrough securities additionally we have used interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to synthetically convert floatingrate assets to fixedrate over time these actions are expected to somewhat reduce our asset sensitivity compared to previous periods while improving current earnings 

interest rate risk measurement 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods net interest income simulation and economic value of equity at risk “eve” in the net interest income simulation method we analyze the expected change in net interest income in response to changes in interest rates in the eve method we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates 

net interest income simulation is an estimate of the total net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income is measured assuming several parallel and nonparallel interest rate 

shifts across the yield curve and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio eg a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lower rate environment our policy contains a trigger for a 10 decline in rate sensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps this trigger and risk capacity apply to both the fast and the slow deposit interest rate change assumptions 

eve is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities we measure changes in the dollar amount of eve for parallel shifts in interest rates due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in eve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney interest rate caps or limits on loans which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for low rate mortgages in a higher rate environment 

the following schedule presents the formal eve limits we have adopted exceptions to the eve limits are subject to notification and approval by the roc in the normal course of business we evaluated our limits and made changes to reflect our current balance sheet management objectives these changes are reflected in the following schedule 

schedule 28   

economic value of equity decline limits 



estimating the impact on net interest income and eve requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration eg customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit competitive pricing eg existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates loan and security prepayments and the effects of other similar embedded options as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans we estimate ranges of possible net interest income and eve results under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options we use historical regression analysis as a guide to setting such assumptions however due to the current low interest rate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit durations may not reflect actual future results additionally competition for funding in the marketplace has and may again result in changes to deposit pricing on interestbearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as libor or the federal funds rate 

under most rising interest rate environments we would expect some customers to move balances in demand deposits to interestbearing accounts such as money market savings or cds the models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration in order to capture the sensitivity of our models to this risk we estimate a range of possible outcomes for interest sensitivity under “fast” and “slow” movements of client funds out of noninterestbearing deposits and into interestbearing sources of funds 

in addition we assume certain correlation rates often referred to as a “deposit beta” of interestbearing deposits wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared to changes in benchmark interest rates generally certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate while interestonchecking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate actual results may differ materially due to factors including competitive pricing money supply credit worthiness of the company and so forth however we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions 

the aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in schedule 29  the company’s models predict an acceleration of deposit runoff in a rising rate environment particularly for demand deposits however the predicted behavior particularly under the fast assumption has not been consistent with the higher than average deposit growth observed in 2016 despite rising market rates and the company is in the process of enhancing deposit behavior models to more accurately reflect observed and anticipated behavior 

schedule 29   

deposit assumptions 



as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in net interest income based on a static balance sheet size in the first year after the interest rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

schedule 30   

income simulation – change in net interest income 



 for comparative purposes the december 31 2015  balances are presented in the following schedule 



 the asset sensitivity as measured by income simulation declined due to deployment of cash into mediumterm securities partially offset by growth in noninterestbearing deposits 

as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in eve under parallel interest rate changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

schedule 31   

changes in economic value of equity 



 for comparative purposes the december 31 2015  measures are presented in the following schedule for positive rate shocks the decline in eve measures are driven by the same factors as those in our income simulation 



 the change in eve from december 31 2015 to december 31 2016 was primarily driven by growth of the securities portfolio in which money market investments were reallocated to medium term securities and the lower modeled duration of nonspecific maturity deposit as shown in schedule 29  as mentioned previously the company has observed discrepancies between actual and modeled behavior for demand deposits and is modifying deposit assumptions appropriately and in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance on model usage and governance model risk management will independently validate the changes in the interest rate risk model with respect to eve estimates certain of our nonspecific maturity deposit assumptions limit the estimated change in deposit value in downside interest rate shocks while these deposit value assumptions have had limited impact on our eve estimates in the past the current interest rate yield curve distinguished by very low rates across the curve is causing these assumptions to have an overstated impact on our eve estimates as a result of the current interest rate environment deposit value assumptions are under review and may change in future reporting periods 

as of december 31 2016 the eve for 200bps shift did not adhere to zions’ interest rate risk capacity of 10 under the fast scenario however this internal policy breach was not due to an excessive extension of asset duration but rather was due to a modeled shortening of liability duration as mentioned previously the company recognizes some limitations in its deposit models and expects this violation to return to policy levels as deposit model assumptions are updated and validated 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at december 31 2016  192 billion of the company’s commercial lending and cre loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate loans 94 are tied to either the prime rate or libor for these variablerate loans we have executed 14 billion of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps additionally asset sensitivity is reduced due to 11 billion of variablerate loans being priced at floored rates at december 31 2016  which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 39 bps at december 31 2016  we also had 32 billion of variablerate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months of these variablerate consumer loans approximately 05 billion were priced at floored rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 54 bps 

see notes 7  and 20  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

market risk – fixed income 

we engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2016  we had a relatively small amount 115 million  of trading assets and 25 million  of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 48 million  and 30 million  at december 31 2015  

we are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value we are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2016  the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs and htm securities decreased by 74 million due largely to changes in the interest rate environment compared to a 74 million improvement in the same prior year period 

market risk – equity investments 

through our equity investment activities we own equity securities that are publiclytraded in addition we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and fhlbs that are not publiclytraded the accounting for equity investments may use the cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs we are exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee consisting of members of management 

we hold both direct and indirect investments in predominately prepublic companies primarily through various small business investment company “sbic” venture capital funds our equity exposure to these investments was approximately 124 million and 113 million at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively on occasion some of the companies within our sbic investments may issue an initial public offering in this case the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment which can introduce additional market risk as of december 31 2016  we had direct sbic investments of 18 million of publiclytraded stocks 

additionally amegy has an alternative investments portfolio these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds are generally not a part of the strategy because the underlying companies are typically not creditworthy the carrying value of amegy ’ s equity investments was 13 million at december 31 2016  and 21 million at december 31 2015  

these peis are subject to the provisions of the doddfrank act the volcker rule of the doddfrank act prohibits banks and bank holding companies from holding peis except for sbic funds beyond july 21 2017 the frb announced in december 2016 that it would allow banks to apply for an additional fiveyear extension to comply with the doddfrank act requirement for these investments the company applied for an extension for the vast majority of its remaining portfolio of peis 

as of december 31 2016  such prohibited peis amounted to 6 million  with an additional 4 million  of unfunded commitments see notes 5  and 17  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information we currently do not believe that this divestiture requirement will ultimately have a material impact on our financial statements 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that our cash flows may not be adequate to fund our ongoing operations and meet our commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet our anticipated financial 

and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines such as the “timetorequired funding” and lcr that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and zb na as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the parent and zb na 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally for the parent and jointly by the parent and bank management for its subsidiary bank the treasury department performs this management centrally under the direction of the corporate treasurer with oversight by alco the treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the company’s liquidity policy these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policy also must be approved by the company’s ermc and the board of directors the company has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk the policy requires the company to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows as the result of a severe liquidity crisis the company targets a buffer of highly liquid assets at the parent to cover 1824 months of cash outflows under a scenario with limited cash inflows and maintains a minimum policy limit of not less than 12 months the company’s banking subsidiary zb na exceeds the regulatory requirements of the modified lcr that mandates a buffer of hqla to cover 70 of 30day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated in the final liquidity rule additionally the company performs monthly liquidity stress testing using a set of internally generated scenarios representing severe liquidity constraints over a 12month horizon zb na maintains a buffer of highly liquid assets consisting of cash us agency and us government sponsored entity securities to cover 30day cash outflows under liquidity stress tests and maintains a contingency funding plan to identify funding sources that would be utilized over the extended 12month horizon throughout 2016 and as of december 31 2016 the company complied with this policy 

liquidity regulation 

in september 2014 us banking regulators issued a final rule that implements a quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the lcr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under this rule we are subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold an adequate amount of unencumbered highquality liquid assets “hqla” that can be converted into cash easily and immediately in private markets to meet its liquidity needs for a shortterm liquidity stress scenario this rule became applicable to us on january 1 2016 

the basel iii liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure the nsfr which requires a financial institution to maintain a stable funding profile over a oneyear period in relation to the characteristics of its on and offbalance sheet activities on october 31 2014 the basel committee on banking supervision issued its final standards for this ratio entitled basel iii the net stable funding ratio  on may 3 2016 the frb issued a proposal requiring bank holding companies with less than 250 billion of assets but more than 50 billion of assets to cover 70 of 1year cash outflows under the assumptions required in the proposed nsfr rule under the proposal bank holding companies would be required to publicly disclose information about the nsfr levels each quarter the proposal has an effective date of january 1 2018 we continue to monitor this proposal and any other developments based on this basel iii publication and the frb proposal we believe we would meet the minimum nsfr if such requirement were currently effective 

we are required by the enhanced prudent standards for liquidity management regulation yy to conduct monthly liquidity stress tests these tests incorporate scenarios designed by us require a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30day funding needs under the stress scenarios and are subject to review by the frb the company’s internal liquidity stresstesting program as contained in its policy complies with these requirements and includes monthly liquidity stress testing using a set of internally generated scenarios representing severe liquidity constraints over a 12month horizon we continue to comply with this regulation 

contractual obligations 

schedule 32  summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2016  

schedule 32   

contractual obligations 



 in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 32  we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

we also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 7  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

liquidity management actions 

consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements at the parent and its subsidiaries decreased to 25 billion at december 31 2016  from 74 billion at december 31 2015  the 49 billion decrease during 2016  resulted primarily from 1 an increase in investment securities 2 net loan originations 3 repayment of longterm debt 4 repurchase and redemption of our preferred stock 5 repurchase and retirement of our common stock and 6 dividends on common and preferred stock these decreases were partially offset by 1 an increase in deposits 2 net cash provided by operating activities and 3 shortterm fhlb borrowings 

during 2016 our afs and htm investment securities increased by 61 billion this increase was primarily due to purchases of shorttomedium duration agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities we have been adding to our investment portfolio during the last couple of years in light of the new lcr rules and more broadly to manage balance sheet liquidity more effectively 

during 2016 we made cash payments totaling 280 million for our longterm debt which matured or were redeemed and did not incur any new longterm debt during the same time period see note 12  for additional detail about debt redemptions and maturities during 2016 we also incurred shortterm debt with the fhlb during 2016 and had a 500 million outstanding balance at december 31 2016 

parent company liquidity – the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate shares of current income taxes and longterm debt and equity issuances 

cash and interestbearing deposits held as investments at the parent decreased to 05 billion at december 31 2016  from 09 billion at december 31 2015  the 04 billion decrease during 2016  was primarily a result of 1 repayment of longterm debt 2 repurchase and redemption of our preferred stock 3 repurchase and retirement of our common stock and 4 dividends on preferred stock and common stock these decreases were partially offset by 1 dividends and return of common equity received from its subsidiary banks on common stock and preferred stock and 2 net cash provided by operating activities see notes 12  and 13  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our longterm debt and equity transactions 

during 2016  the parent received common dividends and return of common equity totaling 250 million and preferred dividends totaling 13 million from its subsidiary bank during 2015  the parent received from its subsidiary banks 192 million for common dividends and return of common equity and 42 million for preferred dividends at december 31 2016 zb na had 626 million available for the payment of dividends under current capital regulations the dividends that zb na can pay to the parent are restricted by current and historical earning levels retained earnings and riskbased and other regulatory capital requirements and limitations 

general financial market and economic conditions impact our access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary bank is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the debt ratings and outlooks issued by the various rating agencies for the company and zb na improved during 2016 and are shown in the following schedules 

schedule 33  presents the zb na’s ratings as of december 31 2016

the parent’s cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses decreased to 35 million in 2016  from 51 million in 2015  as a result of a net repayment of longterm debt of 03 billion during both 2016  and 2015 cash payments for interest are expected to continue to decrease during 2017 from 2016 as a result of the debt repayments during 2016 and 2017 additionally the parent paid approximately 108 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock for both 2016 and 2015 

note 23  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and cash flows for 2016  2015  and 2014  as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2016  and 2015  

during 2017 the parent’s longterm debt maturities consist of 152 million for a senior note due on march 27 2017 at december 31 2016 maturities of our longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from march 2017 to september 2028 with effective interest rates from 450 to 695 

see note 12  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of our longterm debt 

subsidiary bank liquidity – zb na’s primary source of funding is its core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits and time deposits under 250000 on a consolidated basis the company’s loan to total deposit ratio was 801 as of december 31 2016  compared to 807 as of december 31 2015  total deposits increased by 28 billion to 532 billion at december 31 2016 compared to 504 billion at december 31 2015 primarily due to a 18 billion increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits a 07 billion increase in savings and money market deposits and a 06 billion increase in time deposits this increase was partially offset by a 03 billion decrease in foreign deposits also during 2016 zb na redeployed approximately 66 billion of cash to shorttomedium duration agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities zb na’s longterm senior debt ratings are presented in schedule 33  and are slightly better than the parent’s longterm senior debt ratings 

the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and from time to time have been a significant source of funding zb na is a member of the fhlb of des moines the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements the bank is required to invest in fhlb and federal reserve stock to maintain their borrowing capacity 

at december 31 2016  the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 171 billion loans with a carrying value of approximately 240 billion at december 31 2016  have been pledged at the federal reserve and the fhlb of des moines as collateral for current and potential borrowings at december 31 2016 we had 500 million of shortterm fhlb borrowings outstanding and no longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding compared with no short or longterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding at december 31 2015 at december 31 2016 our total investment in fhlb and federal reserve stock was 30 million and 181 million respectively compared to 68 million and 123 million at december 31 2015 respectively as a result of our initiative to consolidate our charters into a single charter the company has shares in a single fhlb des moines historically each affiliate bank held shares in different fhlbs but all of the stock we owned in the other fhlbs have been redeemed the 58 million increase in federal reserve stock is because several statechartered banks were not required to hold stock with the frb and following the consolidation the capital requirements for zb na increased as did our investment in frb stock 

our investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture taken during 2016  htm  afs investment securities’ activities resulted in a net increase in investment securities and a net 59 billion decrease in cash compared with a net 38 billion decrease in cash for 2015  

maturing balances in our subsidiary bank’s loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows lending activity for 2016  resulted in a net cash outflow of 21 billion compared to a net cash outflow of 06 billion for 2015  

during 2016  we paid income taxes of 214 million compared to 132 million during 2015  

operational risk management 

operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events in our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk we have an erm department whose responsibility is to help employees management and the board of directors to assess understand measure manage and monitor risk in accordance with our risk appetite framework we have documented both controls and the control selfassessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and the fdicia 

to manage and minimize our operational risk we have in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate our systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to those systems to our legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s compliance risk management internal audit and credit examination departments reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data in addition the data governance department has strengthened governance surrounding data integrity and availability further we undertake significant efforts to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters we also mitigate operational risk through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

we are continually improving our oversight of operational risk including enhancement of risk identification risk and control selfassessments and antifraud measures which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees the operational risk committee reports to the ermc which reports to the roc additional measures have been taken to increase oversight by erm and operational risk management through the strengthening of new initiative reviews enhancements to the enterprise procurement and third party risk management framework enhancements to the business continuity and disaster recovery programs and enterprise security programs and the establishment of fraud risk oversight incident response oversight and technology project oversight programs significant enhancements have also been made to governance technology and reporting including the establishment of policy and committee governance programs the commencement of an implementation of a governance risk and control solution and the creation of an enterprise risk profile and an operational risk profile along with business line risk profiles in addition the establishment of an enterprise exam management department has standardized our response and reporting and increased our effectiveness and efficiencies with regulatory examinations communications and issues management 

the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our critical systems sometimes referred to as hacking cyber fraud cyber attacks cyber terrorism or other similar names also continue to grow on a daily basis the company its customers and other financial institutions are subject to a large number of such attempts we have established systems and procedures to monitor thwart or mitigate damage from such attempts however in some instances we or our customers have been victimized by cyber fraud our related losses have not been material or some of our customers have been temporarily unable to routinely access our online systems as a result of for example distributed denial of service attacks we continue to review this area of our operations to help ensure that we manage this risk in an effective manner 

capital management 

overview 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” chaired by the chief financial officer and consisting of members of management whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary bank other major cmc responsibilities include 

 the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and zb na to 

 capital planning and stress testing 

the cmc oversees the company’s capital stress testing under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios we have established processes to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the company under hypothetical economic scenarios these stress tests facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity within quantitative limits reflecting the board of directors’ risk appetite these processes are also used to complete the company’s dfast as required by the doddfrank act and the ccar as required by the federal reserve 

filing a capital plan with the federal reserve based on stress testing and documented sound policies processes models controls and governance practices and the subsequent review by the federal reserve is an annual regulatory requirement this capital plan which is subject to objection by the federal reserve governs all of the company’s capital and significant unsecured debt financing actions for a period of five quarters among the actions governed by the capital plan are the repurchase of outstanding capital securities and the timing of new capital issuances and whether the company can pay or increase dividends any such action not included in a capital plan to which the federal reserve has not objected cannot be executed without submission of a revised stress test and capital plan for federal reserve review and nonobjection de minimis changes are allowed without a complete plan resubmission subject to receipt of a federal reserve nonobjection regulations require company disclosure of these stress tests results 

a detailed discussion of ccardfast requirements is contained on page 10  of the “capital plan and stress testing” section under part 1 item 1 in this annual report on form 10k 

on june 23 2016 we filed a form 8k presenting the results of the 2016  dfast the results of the stress test demonstrated that the company has sufficient capital to withstand a severe hypothetical economic downturn detailed disclosure of the stress test results can also be found on our website in addition we submitted on october 

5 2016 our midcycle companyrun dfast based upon the company’s june 30 2016 financial position zions’ midcycle dfast results based on the hypothetical severely adverse scenario indicate the company would maintain capital ratios at sufficient levels throughout the ninequarter forecasting horizon as discussed in the midcycle press release published november 4 2016 zions’ hypothetical severely adverse scenario was designed to create a stressful idiosyncratic environment including a 10 unemployment rate and a 40 decline in commercial property values during the ninequarter projection period the minimum cet1 ratio was 78 

on june 29 2016 we filed a form 8k announcing that the federal reserve did not object to our 2016  capital plan the plan included 1 the increase of the quarterly common dividend to 008 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2016 2 up to 180 million in total repurchases of common equity and 3 up to 144 million in total repurchases of preferred equity these capital actions are expected to reduce preferred dividends and improve the company’s return on equity 

in july 2016 we announced that our board of directors approved 1 a quarterly dividend of 008 per common share in august 2016 and 2 the commencement of a stock repurchase program including 45 million in the third quarter of 2016 see subsequent discussion regarding the repurchases of company common stock the ultimate determination of future reductions of common stock andor preferred stock will depend on a number of factors including actual earnings performance market conditions and the receptivity of investors to the terms of any preferred stock redemption offers as well as the effect of other steps we may explore as we seek to manage our capital any of which could result in a delay of or reduction in the amount of common or preferred equity redemptions repurchases or dividend increases 

on april 25 2016 we launched tender offers for up to 120 million par amount of certain outstanding shares of preferred stock this 120 million is the remaining amount of the 300 million total reduction of preferred stock that was included in our 2015  capital plan to which the federal reserve did not object on may 23 2016 we announced the results of the preferred stock tender offers preferred stock was reduced by 119 million including 27 million 59 million and 33 million for series i j and g respectively as a result of the preferred stock redemption in 2016 preferred dividends are expected to be 104 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 124 million for the second quarter of 2017 our preferred stock may decrease further if we redeem 144 million of preferred equity as authorized by our 2016 capital plan 

basel iii 

the basel iii capital rules which effectively replaced the basel i rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components the basel iii capital rules will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019 in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the rules implemented the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revised the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company compared to the basel i us riskbased capital rules 

a detailed discussion of basel iii requirements including implications for the company is contained on page 9  of the “capital standards – basel framework” section under part 1 item 1 in this annual report on form 10k 

we met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules based upon phasein rules as of december 31 2016 and believe that we would meet all capital adequacy requirements on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective 

capital management actions 

total shareholders’ equity increased by 17 from 75 billion at december 31 2015  to 76 billion at december 31 2016  the increase in total shareholders’ equity is primarily due to net income of 469 million partially offset by 126 million paid to repurchase and redeem a portion of our preferred stock 108 million of dividends paid on preferred stock and common stock repurchases of our common stock totaling 90 million and a 74 million decline in the fair value of our afs securities portfolio due largely to changes in the interest rate 

environment during the first quarter of 2017 we repurchased an additional 45 million of common stock at an average price of 4243 per share leaving 45 million of buyback capacity remaining in the 2016 capital plan which spans the timeframe of july 2016 to june 2017 

during the latter part of 2016 the market price of our common stock increased above the exercise price of common stock warrants on our common stock as of december 31 2016  we have 58 million  common stock warrants at an exercise price of 3627  per share which expire on november 14 2018  and 293 million  common stock warrants at an exercise price of 3582  which expire on may 22 2020 see note 13  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our common stock warrants although there was no effect on our diluted shares for the full 2016 year the increase in the market price of our common stock did increase our diluted shares for the fourth quarter of 2016 and will increase our diluted shares in 2017 if the market price continues to remain higher than the exercise price of the warrants schedule 35  presents the diluted shares from common stock warrants at various zions bancorporation common stock market prices as of february 16 2017 excluding the effect of the change in exercise cost and warrant share multiplier from the payment of common stock dividends

impact of common stock warrants 



the common dividend rate was increased to 008 per share during the third quarter of 2016 from 006 per share paid since the second quarter of 2015 we paid 578 million in dividends on common stock during 2016  compared to 452 million during 2015  during its january 2017 meeting the board of directors declared a dividend of 008 per common share payable on february 23 2017 to shareholders of record on february 16 2017 

we paid preferred stock dividends of 501 million and 629 million during 2016  and 2015  respectively we also recorded a onetime 98 million reduction to net earnings applicable to common shareholders as a result of the preferred stock redemption during 2016 

banking organizations are required by capital regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios the company’ capital ratios as of december 31 2016  and 2015 under basel iii and december 31 2014  under basel i are shown in schedule 36

 note 18  of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information on riskbased capital 

at december 31 2016  basel iii regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital was 67 billion and 76 billion respectively compared with 66 billion and 75 billion respectively at december 31 2015 

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the company’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements gaap has established a threelevel hierarchy to 

prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the company’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available the company uses valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors investment securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of other than temporary impairment “otti” otti is considered to have occurred if its fair value is below amortized cost and 1 we intend to sell the security or 2 it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis the “more likely than not” criterion is a lower threshold than the “probable” criterion 

notes 1  5  7  9  and 20  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the “investment securities portfolio” on page 50  contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

allowance for credit losses 

the acl includes the alll and the rulc the alll represents management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses as well as a qualitative review of the results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment and is described in more detail in note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the rulc provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the alll plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

numerous components enter into the evaluation of the alll although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses   as an example if the probability of default risk grade for all passgraded commercial and cre loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal risk grading scale the quantitatively determined amount of the alll at december 31 2016  would increase by approximately 109 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in risk grades may have on the allowance estimate 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the alll such factors include but are not limited to national and regional economic trends and indicators we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the alll for the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 55   contains further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the acl 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this annual test as of october 1 of each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit generally one of our banking segments compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired 

to determine the fair value we generally use a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publiclytraded financial service companies primarily banks and bank holding companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the company is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the company’s geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium ranging from 0 to 25 for the reporting units was appropriate at the most recent test date 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount estimates include economic conditions which impact the 

assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the company ’ s regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2016  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective october 1 2016  upon completion of the evaluation process we concluded that none of our reporting units was impaired furthermore the evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 16 30 and 52 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100bps the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 14 28 and 47 respectively 

income taxes 

we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

we had net dtas of 250 million at december 31 2016  compared with 203 million at december 31 2015  the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the alll 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities 3 pension and postretirement obligations and 4 deferred compensation arrangements no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2016  related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to 1 carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods 2 utilize the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences 3 implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible and 4 generate future taxable income 

after considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits we have tax reserves at december 31 2016  of approximately 35 million net of federal andor state benefits primarily relating to uncertain tax positions for tax credits on technology initiatives

reducing returns to our shareholders this regulatory framework has been materially revised and expanded since the 20082009 financial crisis and recession in particular the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated pursuant to it have given financial regulators expanded powers over nearly every aspect of the company’s business these include among other things new higher regulatory capital requirements regulation of dividends and other forms of capital distributions to shareholders through annual stress testing and capital planning processes heightened liquidity and liquidity stress testing requirements which include specific definitions of the types of investment securities that qualify as “high quality liquid assets” and which effectively limit the portion of the company’s balance sheet that can be used to meet the credit needs of its customers specific limitations on mortgage lending products and practices specific limits on certain consumer payment fees and subjecting compensation practices to specific regulatory oversight and restrictions individually and collectively these additional regulations have imposed and will continue to impose higher costs on the company and have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation or clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined the company is committed to both satisfying heightened regulatory expectations and providing attractive shareholder returns however given the stillchanging regulatory environment the results of these efforts cannot yet be known 

described below are the material elements of some selected laws and regulations applicable to the company the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable laws or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the company 

the parent is a bank holding company and a financial holding company as provided by the bhc act as modified by the glb act and the doddfrank act these and other federal statutes provide the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the frb the supervision of zb na and other regulated subsidiaries is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator and the laws and regulations administered by those regulators the glb act allows our subsidiary bank to engage in certain financial activities through financial subsidiaries to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company or to do business through a financial subsidiary the parent and its subsidiary bank must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required 

zb na is subject to the provisions of the national bank act or other statutes governing national banks as well as the rules and regulations of the occ the cfpb and the fdic it is also subject to periodic examination and supervision by the occ and the fdic some of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other federal and state agencies these regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec finra andor state securities regulators 

the doddfrank act 

the recent financial crisis led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states 

the doddfrank act and regulations adopted under the doddfrank act broadly affect the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities requiring ongoing stress testing of our capital and liquidity mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring divestiture of certain equity investments increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector among other things affecting capital standards the doddfrank act provides that 

 regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act require us to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets than was generally the case before the crisis and limit the forms of capital that we will be able to rely upon for regulatory purposes in addition in its supervisory role with respect to our stress testing and capital planning our ability to deliver returns to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases is subject to prior nonobjection by the frb the stress testing and capital plan process also could substantially reduce our flexibility to respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and the pricing of certain products and services including the following 

 the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining large financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the cfpb also enacted new regulations that became fully effective january 10 2014 which require significant changes to residential mortgage origination these changes include the definition of a “qualified mortgage” and the requirement regarding how a borrower’s “ability to repay” must be determined the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws which had enabled national banks and their subsidiaries to comply with federal regulatory requirements without complying with various state laws in addition the doddfrank act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

the doddfrank act contains numerous provisions that limit or place significant burdens and costs on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds for the affected activities these provisions may result in increased compliance and other costs increased legal risk and decreased scope of product offerings and earning assets 

the company is subject to the provisions of the volcker rule “vr” issued pursuant to the doddfrank act as of december 31 2014 the company had divested all securities that were not in compliance with the vr and had sold all but 18 million  amortized cost of noncompliant investments such investments also provide for 7 million  of potential capital calls which the company expects to fund as allowed by the vr if and as the capital calls are made until the investments are sold these investments are in private equity funds and are referred to in this document as private equity investments “peis” the company continues to pursue the disposition of all noncompliant peis the frb has granted a blanket extension of the vr compliance date to july 21 2016 an additional oneyear extension by the frb is expected to further extend the volcker conformance period for existing investments to july 21 2017 

the company and other companies subject to the doddfrank act are subject to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance 

and proposed rules these requirements generally implement the compensation restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act and include documentation and governance deferral risk balancing and clawback requirements 

some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation or clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined 

capital standards – basel framework 

the basel iii capital rules which effectively replaced the basel i rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components and other provisions in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the rules implemented the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revised the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company compared to the basel i us riskbased capital rules 

the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replaced the riskweighting approach derived from basel i capital accords of the basel committee with a more risksensitive approach based in part on the standardized approach in the basel committee’s 2004 basel ii capital accords the basel iii capital rules also implemented the requirements of section 939a of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules 

the basel iii capital rules among other things i introduced a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” ii specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements iii applied most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and iv expanded the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared to prior regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratios as of january 1 2015 were as follows 

 when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 the basel iii capital rules will also require the company and its subsidiary bank to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

the basel iii capital rules also prescribe a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expand the riskweighting categories from basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a 

variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

the basel iii capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets “dta” dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 the application of this part of the rule did not result in any deductions from cet1 as a result of the large amount of cdo sales completed in 2014 and 2015 the company does not expect the application of the basel iii corresponding deduction rules to have an effect on its basel iii regulatory capital ratios either as phasedin or on a fully phasedin basis 

under prior basel i capital standards the effects of aoci items included in capital were excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios as a “nonadvanced approaches banking organization” we made a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items as allowed under the basel iii capital rules 

basel iii also requires additional regulatory capital disclosures to be made that are commonly referred to as “pillar 3” disclosures these disclosures require the company to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding its capital structure adequacy and riskweighted assets the company began publishing these pillar 3 disclosures in 2015 and such disclosures are available on the company’s website 

the company met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules based upon a 2015 phasein as of december 31 2015 and believes it would meet all capital adequacy requirements on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective 

capital plan and stress testing 

the company is required by the doddfrank act to participate in annual stress tests known as the doddfrank annual stress test “dfast” and federal reserve’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” the company submitted its 2015 capital plan and stress test results to the frb on january 5 2015 in its capital plan the company was required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios for nine quarters ending the fourth quarter of 2016 its estimated regulatory capital ratios including its tier 1 common “t1c” ratio associated with the basel i capital rules its cet1 ratio under the basel iii capital rules and its gaap tangible common equity ratio on march 11 2015 we announced that the federal reserve notified us that it did not object to the capital actions outlined in our 2015 capital plan the plan included 1 the increase of the quarterly common dividend to 006 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2015 2 the continued payment of preferred dividends at the current rates and 3 up to 300 million in total reduction of preferred equity 

the company’s stress test results were significantly different from those modeled by the frb as the frb estimated that the company’s minimum tier 1 common ratio in the severely adverse scenario was 51 just above the 50 minimum since the release of the frb’s modeled results the company has undertaken several actions designed in part to improve the company’s risk profile under the ccar stress tests these actions include selling parts of the investment portfolio extending the duration of the investment portfolio and limiting growth in certain loan categories which are perceived as risky in the ccar stress test 

during the second quarter of 2015 we completed our midcycle capital stress test as required under dfast the results demonstrated that we maintained sufficient capital to withstand a severe economic downturn detailed disclosure of the midcycle stress test results can be found on the company’s website under the implementing regulations for ccar a bank holding company may generally raise and redeem capital pay dividends and repurchase stock and take similar capitalrelated actions only under a capital plan as to which the frb has not objected 

on february 17 2014 the federal reserve published final rules to implement section 165 enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the board of governors and certain bank holding companies  of the doddfrank act the company believes that it is in compliance with these rules 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia as modified by the basel iii capital rules an insured depository institution generally will be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its cet1 ratio is under 3 its total riskbased capital ratio is less than 8 its tier 1 riskbased capital ratio is less than 6 or its tier 1 leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan 

other regulations 

the company is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

 11 

holding company the bhc act also requires approval for certain nonbanking acquisitions restricts the activities of bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies to banking managing or controlling banks and other activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto and restricts the nonbanking activities of a financial holding company to those that are permitted for financial holding companies or that have been determined by the frb to be financial in nature incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities 

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk practices this system includes policies and guidelines such as corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of company stock by insiders and charters for the audit risk oversight compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

risk factors 

tableend the company’s growth strategy is driven by key factors while adhering to defined risk parameters the key elements of zions’ strategy reflect its prudent risktaking philosophy the company generates revenue by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks these factors are outlined in the company’s risk appetite framework 

the company’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee of the board approved an enterprise risk management framework and appointed an enterprise risk management committee “ermc” consisting of senior management to oversee and implement the framework the company’s most significant risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in prudent extension of credit to relationship customers in addition to credit risk these committees also monitor the following risk areas market and interest rate risks liquidity risk strategicbusiness risk operationaltechnology risks model risk capitalfinancial reporting risks legalcompliance risks including regulatory risk and reputational risk as outlined in the company’s risk taxonomy additional governance and oversight includes boardapproved policies and management committees with direct focus on these specific risk categories 

the following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the company including but not limited to 

credit risk 

credit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks if the strength of the us economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations declined this could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses “alll” 

we have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio including loans secured by real estate and oil and gasrelated lending which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results given the current volatility in oil prices and the potential for oil prices to remain low for an extended period of time zions bancorporation’s credit exposure in oil and gas could be adversely impacted we have heightened our oversight of this credit exposure and have taken proactive steps to effectively manage this book of business 

concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the company concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the company due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk 

we engage in commercial construction and land acquisition and development lending as well as commercial term lending primarily in our western states footprint the company as a whole has relatively larger concentrations of such lending than many other peer institutions in addition we have a concentration in oil and gasrelated lending primarily in texas at amegy both commercial real estate “cre” and oil and gas lending are subject to specific risks including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateral values and activity levels in addition our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states and values there may behave differently than in other parts of the united states we may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the united states 

as a regional bank holding company the company provides a full range of banking and related services through its local management teams and unique brands in arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah washington and wyoming approximately 80 of the company’s total net interest income for the year ended december 31 2015 and 77 of total assets as of december 31 2015 relate to our banking operations in utah texas and california this is compared to 82 of the company’s total net interest income for the year ended december 31 2014 and 78 of total assets as of december 31 2014 as a result of this geographic concentration our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results for example our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events at both december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  loan balances associated with our banking operations in utah texas and california comprised 81 of the company’s commercial lending portfolio 75 of the cre lending portfolio and 69 of the consumer lending portfolio loans originated by our banking operations in utah texas and california are primarily to borrowers in those respective states with the exception of the national real estate group which cooriginates or purchases primarily owner occupied first cre loans from financial institutions throughout the country 

we have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

adverse economic conditions negatively affect the company’s assets including its loans and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition the most recent financial crisis resulted in significant regulatory changes that continue to affect the company although economic conditions have improved since the most recent financial crisis it is possible that economic conditions may weaken or that sluggish economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time economic and fiscal conditions in the united states and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic and market conditions faced by the company and its customers any sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions would adversely affect the company the company has exposure to oil and gasrelated companies that are currently experiencing a prolonged period of low energy prices for more information regarding the company’s exposure to oil and gasrelated companies see “oil and gasrelated exposure” in “risk elements” on pages 5255 of mda in this form 10k 

market and interest rate risks 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability management committee which is appointed by the company’s board of directors failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect the company factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

the company remains in an “assetsensitive” interest rate risk position which means that net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates increase and to decline if interest rates decrease most recently the frb maintained the target range for federal funds rate at 025 to 050 and indicated that it will determine the timing and size of future rate adjustments by assessing realized and expected economic conditions relative to the objectives of maximum employment and 2 inflation 

financial market participants have recently contemplated the possibility of negative interest rates with the exception of brief money market disruptions in which some us treasury bills traded at negative rates the us has not previously experienced a negative rate environment although other developed economies have had prolonged periods of negative rates therefore there are many unknown factors which could impact the company in a negative rate environment the ability to effectively charge customers interest on deposits will be determined largely by competition for deposits but the company’s deposit systems may require modification to allow for negative deposit rates asset allocation strategies would be reconsidered were the frb to charge for excess reserves 

our estimates of our interest rate risk position related to noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on assumptions for which there is little historical experience and the actual behavior of those deposits in a changing interest rate environment may differ materially from our estimates which could materially affect our results of operations 

we have experienced a low interest rate environment for the past several years our views with respect to among other things the degree to which we are “assetsensitive” including our interest rate risk position for noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on modeled projections that rely on assumptions regarding changes in balances of such deposits in a changing interest rate environment because there is no modern precedent for the prolonged extremely low interest rate environment that has prevailed for the last several years there is little historical experience upon which to base such assumptions if interest rates continue to increase our assumptions regarding changes in balances of noninterestbearing demand deposits and regarding the speed and degree to which other deposits are repriced may prove to be incorrect and business decisions made in reliance on our modeled projections and underlying assumptions could prove to be unsuccessful because noninterestbearing demand deposits are a significant portion of our deposit base realized results which are different from our modeled projections and the underlying assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

liquidity risk 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us certain of our affiliates and particular classes of securities that we and our banking subsidiary issue the rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we our affiliates andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies ratings downgrades to us our affiliates or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

as a regulated entity we are subject to capital and liquidity requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth 

we are a bank holding company and a financial holding company as such we and our subsidiary bank are subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the frb the occ and the fdic including riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements and basel iii liquidity requirements capital needs may rise above normal levels when we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition risk profile and growth plans in addition we may be required to increase our capital levels even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts as a result of stress testing and capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios compliance with the capital requirements including leverage ratios may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain 

present business levels for a summary of the capital rules to which we are subject see “capital standards – basel framework” in “supervision and regulation” on page 9 of mda in this form 10k 

liquidity regulations including regulations establishing a minimum liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and requiring monthly liquidity stress testing applicable to the company may impact profitability 

the company is subject to liquidity regulations including a requirement that it conduct monthly liquidity stress tests that require it maintain a modified lcr of at least 100 effective january 1 2016 the company’s calculation of the modified lcr indicates that the company is in compliance with the requirement such stress testing is subject to ongoing model and assumptions changes which could affect results 

in order to meet the requirements of these new regulations the company expects to continue to hold a higher portion of its assets in high quality liquid assets “hqla” and a lower portion of its assets in loans than was generally the case prior to such regulation hqla generally have lower yields than loans of the type made by the company 

the company may not be able to utilize the significant deferred tax asset recorded on its balance sheet 

the company’s balance sheet includes a significant dta the largest components of this asset result from additions to our alll for purposes of generally accepted accounting principles in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes our ability to continue to record this dta is dependent on the company’s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital in addition inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations currently no dta are disallowed for regulatory purposes either on a consolidated basis or at the company’s subsidiary bank 

strategicbusiness risk 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us information security and vendor management processes are in place to actively identify manage and monitor actual and potential impacts 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

we have made and are continuing to make significant changes to the company that include among other things the combination of certain of our subsidiary companies into a single entity other organizational restructurings efficiency initiatives and replacement or upgrades of certain core technological systems to improve our control environment operating efficiency and results of operations the ultimate success and completion of these changes and their effect on the company may vary significantly from initial planning which could materially adversely affect the company 

during 2013 our board of directors approved a significant investment by us to replace our loan and deposit systems and to upgrade our accounting systems the new integrated system for most of our loans and deposits is expected to employ technology that is a significant improvement over our current systems these initiatives will be completed in phases to allow for appropriate testing and implementation so as to minimize time delays and cost 

overruns in december 2015 the company consolidated its seven subsidiary banks a subsidiary trust company and our service company into a single bank the company also decided to make other organizational changes such as the realignment of management responsibilities and the rationalization of support functions including accounting and risk and back office operations additionally in june 2015 management announced certain efficiency initiatives to improve operating results and return on equity 

these changes continue to be implemented and some are in their early stages by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings expected efficiencies and related items are subject to change and significant variability 

we may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these changes these may include significant time delays cost overruns loss of key people technological problems processing failures and other adverse developments our ability to attract key employees with appropriate talent to implement these changes may also be challenged further our ability to maintain an adequate control environment may be impacted any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems processes controls procedures and employees which may adversely impact our customers and our ability to conduct business 

we have plans policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these potential adverse developments however there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately remediated the ultimate effect of any adverse development could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect the company including its control environment operating efficiency and results of operations 

operationaltechnology risks 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and the company 

the company has significant operations and a significant customer base in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy the company’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to the company’s property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the company’s customers and in turn on the company although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations these efforts also include the management of controls to mitigate operational risks for programs and processes across the company 

we could be adversely affected by financial technology advancements and other nontraditional lending and banking sources 

the ability to successfully remain competitive is dependent upon our ability to maintain a critical technological capability and identify and develop new valueadded products for existing and future customers failure to do so could impede our time to market reduce customer product accessibility and weaken our competitive position 

our information systems may experience an interruption or security breach 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems misappropriation of funds and theft of proprietary company or customer data while we have significant internal resources policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability

we increasingly use models in the management of the company and in particular in the required stress testing and capital plan there is risk that these models are incorrect or inaccurate in various ways which can cause us to make nonoptimal decisions and this risk causes the company to hold additional capital as a buffer against that risk 

we attempt to carefully develop document back test and validate the models used in the management of the company including for example models used in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk and those used in projecting stress losses in various segments of our credit and securities portfolios and projecting net revenue under stress models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons however and cannot perfectly predict outcomes management decisions based in part on such models therefore can be suboptimal in addition in determining the company’s capital needs under stress testing we attempt to specifically quantify the amounts by which model results could be incorrect and we hold material additional amounts of capital as a buffer against this “model risk 

capitalfinancial reporting risks 

stress testing and capital management under the doddfrank act may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

under the ccar we are required to submit to the frb each year our capital plan for the applicable planning horizon along with the results of required stress tests each annual capital plan will among other things specify our planned capital actions with respect to dividends preferred stock redemptions common stock buybacks or issuances and similar matters and will be subject to the objection or nonobjection by the frb moreover the ccar process requires us to analyze the pro forma impact on our financial condition of various hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios selected by us and the frb we must maintain or raise capital sufficient to meet our risk management and regulatory expectations under such hypothetical scenarios in connection with the annual ccar process we also participate in the doddfrank act stress tests “dfast” on a semiannual basis under dfast a standardized strategy for capital actions dividend payments held constant and other current capital obligations met is implemented by all participating banks as required by the doddfrank act we also submit stress tests to the occ for our subsidiary bank because it has assets in excess of 10 billion under both ccar and dfast the federal reserve uses its proprietary models to analyze the company’s stressed capital position the severity of the hypothetical scenarios devised by the frb and occ and employed in these stress tests is undefined by law or regulation and is thus subject solely to the discretion of the regulators the stress testing and capital planning processes may among other things require us to increase our capital levels limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under stress testing and capital management standards implemented by bank regulatory agencies under the doddfrank act we may declare dividends repurchase common stock redeem preferred stock and debt access capital markets for certain types of capital make acquisitions and enter into similar transactions only if included in a 

capital plan to which the frb has not objected any similar transactions not contemplated in our annual capital plan other than those with an inconsequential impact on actual or projected capital may require a new stress test and capital plan which is subject to frb nonobjection these requirements may significantly limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

the company and its subsidiary bank must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by its banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios and the particular conditions risk profiles and growth plans of the company and its subsidiary bank compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require the company or its subsidiaries to raise additional capital or may require additional capital investment from the parent these uncertainties and risks including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties may increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the company provides to its customers invests in and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the company to comply before their formal adoption therefore identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk 

our results of operations depend upon the performance of our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our banking subsidiary and other subsidiaries the parent receives substantially all of its revenues from dividends from its subsidiaries and primarily from its subsidiary bank these dividends are a principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt we and certain of our subsidiaries experienced periods of unprofitability or reduced profitability during the most recent recession of 20072009 the ability of the company and its subsidiary bank to pay dividends is restricted by regulatory requirements including profitability and the need to maintain required levels of capital lack of profitability or reduced profitability exposes us to the risk that regulators could restrict the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends it also increases the risk that the company may have to establish a “valuation allowance” against its net dta or have that asset disallowed for regulatory capital purposes 

the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends or make other payments to us is also limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general regulatory restrictions on its dividends if it does not satisfy these regulatory requirements we may be unable to pay dividends or interest on our indebtedness the occ the primary regulator of our subsidiary bank has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks to pay dividends only out of current earnings in addition if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which could include the payment of dividends such authority may take actions requiring that such bank refrain from the practice payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if a subsidiary bank were to become “undercapitalized” for purposes of the applicable federal regulatory “prompt corrective action” regulations 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

as of december 31 2015 the company had 1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to amegy cbt and zions bank if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value the company may have to 

take a charge related to the impairment of its goodwill such a charge would occur if the fair value of the company’s net assets improves at a faster rate than the market value of our reporting units or if the company was to experience increases in the book value of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in the fair value of equity of a reporting unit a significant decline in the company’s expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the company’s common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein may necessitate the company taking charges in the future related to the impairment of its goodwill future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of the appropriateness of the goodwill carrying value if the company was to conclude that a future writedown of its goodwill is necessary it would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

legalcompliance risks 

the doddfrank act imposes significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank act has material implications for the company and the entire financial services industry the doddfrank act places significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions particularly those with more than 50 billion of assets including the company in addition among other things the doddfrank act 

 the company and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel systems consulting and other costs in order to comply with new regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act particularly with respect to stress testing and risk management some aspects of the doddfrank act continue to be subject to rulemaking many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation and clarification and accordingly the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined individually and collectively regulations adopted under the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the company’s and the financial services industry’s business financial condition including the company’s ability to compete effectively with less regulated financial services providers and results of operations 

other legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and earnings 

in addition to the doddfrank act described previously bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and accordingly we are subject to fdic insurance assessments   

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted however if adopted some of these proposals could adversely affect the company by among other things impacting aftertax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting the company’s ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of the company’s funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that the company could offer and requiring the company to raise capital at inopportune times 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be adopted 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims fines litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings the company’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and increasingly aggressive enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations 

reputational risk 

the company is presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational compliance and legal risks 

a reputational risk council was established to monitor manage and develop strategies to effectively manage reputational risk which includes but is not limited to addressing communication logistics legal and regulatory issues

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and its subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 60 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is considered a “systemically important financial institution” under the doddfrank act

management’s overview of 2015 performance 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2015 of 2466 million or 120 per diluted common share compared to 3266 million or 168 per diluted common share for 2014 the decline in net income in 2015 was primarily due to the sale of the company’s remaining cdo portfolio 574 million  at amortized cost as the company sold these noncore assets with asymmetric risk characteristics while we are encouraged with the 2015 results net income and returns on capital are still lower than the company’s objectives the 2015 results were due to risk reduction actions major operational initiatives and operating results 

major initiative announced in 2015 

in june 2015 we announced a corporate restructuring in conjunction with a series of significant changes designed to substantially improve customer experience eg faster turnaround times simplify our corporate structure and operations and drive positive operating leverage key elements of the announcement included 

 financial performance targets 

following are the targeted financial performance outcomes of these organizational changes and associated operational and technological initiatives with some brief comments regarding current performance against these measures 

 our initiatives are designed to make the company a more efficient organization that drives positive operating leverage simplifies the corporate structure and operations and improves customer experience the increase in operating leverage is expected to come through increased revenue from growth in loans deployment of cash to mortgagebacked securities increased use of interest rate swaps improvement in core fee income and disciplined expense management 

if successfully implemented these initiatives should ultimately produce better revenue and expense trajectories improve profitability and drive stronger investor returns 

risk management actions in 2015 

during 2015 the company underwent a significant balance sheet restructuring which contributed to overall changes in its risk profile the restructuring included the following actions 

 areas experiencing strength in 2015 

net interest income which is more than threequarters of our revenue improved by 353 million as compared to 2014 we reduced longterm debt by 275 million through redemptions at maturity which reduced interest expense by approximately 545 million and will continue to benefit net interest income in 2016 additionally we increased the investment securities portfolio substantially in 2015 purchasing several billion dollars of government agency securities which resulted in a 243 million increase in interest income this action should improve both the company’s revenue stability under future stressful economic scenarios and current earnings significantly as compared to the alternative of holding money market investments 

noninterest income from customerrelated fees in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased approximately 4 from the prior year period this increase was due to increased commercial credit card fees and fees generated on sales of swaps to clients 

adjusted noninterest expense was held to our articulated goal of less than 16 billion see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 76 for more information regarding the calculation of the efficiency ratio and which expenses are excluded in arriving at adjusted noninterest expense during the year we cut consulting expenses by approximately 13 million or 34 and took additional steps necessary to meet our aforementioned expense target 

we successfully completed a tender offer for preferred stock reducing preferred equity by 176 million our 2015 capital plan which runs through the second quarter of 2016 allows for an additional use of up to 120 million of cash for preferred stock redemptions subject to the generation of retained earnings in approximately that amount subsequent to september 30 2015 

tangible book value per common share improved by 55 to 2763  at december 31 2015 compared to 2623  at december 31 2014 due to increased retained earnings and a reduction in aoci due to cdo sales see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 76 for more information regarding the calculation of tangible book value per common share

results of operations 

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest portion of our revenue for 2015 taxableequivalent net interest income was 17332 million compared to 16962 million and 17119 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all years presented 

net interest margin in 2015 vs 2014 

the nim was 319 and 326 for 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease resulted primarily from lower yields on loans and reduced interest income from fdicsupported loans the impact of these items was partially offset by lower yields and balances on our longterm debt and a change in the mix of interestearning assets as cash held in money market investments was transitioned to term investment securities 

even though our average loan portfolio was 649 million higher during 2015 compared to 2014 the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio was 18 bps lower than it was in 2014 the resulting decline in interest income was primarily caused by reduced interest income on loans purchased from the fdic in 2009 as those acquired portfolios were successfully managed down and new loans being originated at lower yields than those that prepaid or matured 

the average balance of availableforsale “afs” securities for 2015 increased by 17 billion or 492 compared to 2014 and the average yield in 2015 was 24 bps lower than in 2014 the decline in the average yield and the changes in the average balance are a result of changes in the composition of the afs portfolio and the yields of the securities sold and purchased beginning in the second half of 2014 we started purchasing us agency passthrough 

securities in order to increase our holdings of hqla and to alter the mix of our interestearning assets these increases were partially offset by cdo sales and paydowns 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided us with low cost funding and comprised 439 of average total deposits for 2015 compared to 424 for 2014 average interestbearing deposit balances increased by 23 in 2015 compared to 2014 additionally the rate paid declined by 1 bps to 18 bps 

the average balance of longterm debt was 790 million lower for 2015 compared to 2014 the reduced balance was the result of tender offers early calls and maturities the average interest rate on longterm debt for 2015 decreased by 8 bps compared to 2014 this is due to the maturity of higher cost longterm debt in the latter part of 2015 on september 15 2015 and november 16 2015 respectively there was 112 million of 60 and 124 million of 55 subordinated and convertible debt notes that matured the total effective cost of this debt was approximately 15 during 2015 the higher effective cost for the debt that matured was due to the amortization of debt discount we continue to look for opportunities to manage down the cost of funds refer to the “liquidity risk management” section beginning on page 68 for more information 

during 2015 most of our cash in excess of that needed to fund earning assets was held in money market investments primarily deposits with the federal reserve bank average money market investments were 152 of total interestearning assets compared to 158 in the prior year 

net interest margin in 2014 vs 2013 

the nim was 326 and 336 for 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease resulted primarily from lower yields on loans and afs investment securities the impact of these items was partially offset by lower yields and balances on our longterm debt 

even though our average loan portfolio was 14 billion higher during 2014 compared to 2013 the average interest rate earned on those assets was 439 which is 38 bps lower than the comparable prior year rate this decline in interest income was primarily caused by 1 reduced interest income on loans acquired with fdic assistance in 2009 as those acquired portfolios were successfully managed down 2 adjustable rate loans originated in the past resetting to lower rates due to the current repricing index being lower than the rate when the loans were originated and 3 loans originated at lower rates than the weighted average rate of the existing portfolio the primary reasons for the narrowing of credit and interest rate spreads was a combination of competitive pricing pressures and improved customer credit which were the result of a more stable economic environment than compared to prior years a portion of the narrowing of the spreads may be attributed to the improved fundamental condition of our borrowers such as stronger earnings and improved leverage ratios 

the average heldtomaturity “htm” securities portfolio was 609 million during 2014 compared to 762 million during the same prior year period during the fourth quarter of 2013 we reclassified a substantial portion of our cdo securities from htm to afs as a result of the impact of the vr the average yield earned during 2014 on htm securities was 36 bps higher than the yield in 2013 primarily due to the reclassification of cdo securities into the afs portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2013 that have a lower yield than the remaining securities in the htm portfolio 

the average balance of afs securities for 2014 increased by 365 million or 117 compared to 2013 and the average yield in 2014 was 15 bps lower than in 2013 the increase in afs securities was due primarily to purchases of approximately 1 billion par amount of agency passthrough securities the yield was also impacted by the sale of 913 million amortized cost of our cdo securities during 2014 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided us with low cost funding and comprised 424 of average total deposits for 2014 compared to 397 for 2013 average interestbearing deposit balances were down 25 in 2014 compared to 2013 however the rate paid declined by 3 bps to 19 bps thus continuing the difficulty to reduce deposit costs further as these costs approach zero 

during 2014 we reduced longterm debt by 12 billion as a result of tender offers early calls and redemptions at maturity including 835 million during the third quarter of 2014 these actions led to a decrease of 463 million or 203 of our average longterm debt outstanding in 2014 compared to 2013 the average interest rate paid on longterm debt for 2014 decreased by 138 bps compared to 2013 refer to the “liquidity risk management” section beginning on page 68 for more information 

during 2014 most of our cash in excess of that needed to fund earning assets was invested in money market assets primarily deposits with the federal reserve bank average money market investments were 158 of total interestearning assets compared to 174 in the prior year 

see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 63 for further discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and the associated risk 

interest rate spreads 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 299 for both 2015 and 2014 and 302 for 2013 the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2015 and 2014 was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim 

we expect the mix of interestearning assets to continue to change over the next several quarters due to slighttomoderate loan growth in the commercial and industrial and consumer portfolios accompanied by somewhat less growth in cre loans and partially offset by continued attrition in the oil and gas portfolio in addition as discussed below we are incrementally investing in shorttomedium duration us agency passthrough securities that qualify as hqla over time we expect these investments to reduce the proportion of earning assets in money market investments and increase the proportion of afs securities average yields on the loan portfolio may continue to experience modest downward pressure due to competitive pricing and growth in loweryielding residential mortgages however we expect this pressure to be somewhat less compared to the prior two years we believe that some of the downward pressure on the nim will be mitigated by lower interest expense on reduced levels of longterm debt due to maturities that occurred towards the end of 2015 we also believe we can offset some of the pressure on the nim through loan growth redeployment of cash held in money market investments to term investment securities and employment of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges 

we expect to remain “assetsensitive” which refers to net interest income increasing as a result of a rising interest rate environment with regard to interest rate risk in response to new liquidity and liquidity stresstesting regulations which elevate relative to historic levels the proportion of hqla we will be required to hold we decided in the second half of 2014 to begin deploying cash into shorttomedium duration us agency passthrough securities during 2015 we purchased hqla securities of 48 billion at amortized cost increasing hqla securities by 40 billion after paydowns and payoffs during the year and we are continuing these purchases over time these purchases are expected to somewhat reduce our asset sensitivity compared to previous periods our estimates of the company’s actual interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes in addition our modeled projections for noninterestbearing demand deposits which are a substantial portion of our deposit balances are particularly reliant on assumptions for which there is little historical experience due to the prolonged period of very low interest rates further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate risk” on page 63

provisions for credit losses 

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based on the inherent risks in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments “rulc” at an adequate level based on the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of our various loan portfolios the levels of actual charge 

offs credit trends and external factors see note 6   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 50 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

during the past few years we have experienced an improvement in credit quality metrics however recently we have experienced deterioration in credit quality metrics associated with oil and gasrelated loans at amegy overall credit quality metrics for 2015 compared to 2014 deteriorated moderately gross loan and lease chargeoffs increased to 1389 million in 2015 compared to 1062 million in 2014 additionally we had gross recoveries of 1003 million in 2015 compared to 640 million in 2014 

nonperforming assets increased to 357 million at december 31 2015 from 326 million at december 31 2014 the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases and other real estate owned “oreo” increased to 087 at december 31 2015 from 081 at december 31 2014 classified loans increased to 14 billion at december 31 2015 from 11 billion at december 31 2014 approximately 87 of classified loans at december 31 2015 were current as to principal and interest payments compared to 83 at december 31 2014 classified loans are loans with welldefined credit weaknesses that are risk graded substandard or doubtful 

the allowance for loan losses increased by approximately 14 million since december 31 2014 due to deterioration within the oil and gas portfolio which offset improvements in credit quality metrics outside of the oil and gas portfolio this resulted in a provision of 400 million in 2015 compared to a provision of 981 million for 2014 the negative provision in 2014 was due to the continued improvement in portfoliospecific credit quality metrics and sustained improvement in broader economic and credit quality indicators up to that point we continue to exercise caution with regard to the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses given the state of the economy and the sensitivity of the oil and gas loan portfolio to energy prices refer to the “oil and gasrelated exposure” section on page 52 for more information 

during 2015 we recorded a 62 million provision for unfunded lending commitments compared to 86 million in 2014 the negative provision recognized in 2015 is primarily due to the funding of one large impaired letter of credit partially offset by deterioration in the oil and gasrelated portfolio the negative provision recognized in 2014 was primarily due to significant improvement in portfoliospecific credit quality metrics sustained improvement in broader economic and credit quality indicators and changes in the portfolio mix from quarter to quarter the provision for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations funding and changes in credit quality 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield for 2015 noninterest income was 3771 million compared to 5086 million in 2014 and 3374 million in 2013

other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of atm fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit and credit card interchange fees cash management fees lending commitment fees syndication and servicing fees and other miscellaneous fees increased by 128 million compared to 2014 the increase was primarily a result of higher interchange fees and fees generated on sales of swaps to clients partially offset by a decline in loan fees in 2014 other service charges commissions and fees increased by 100 million compared to 2013 most of the increase can be attributed to higher interchange fees which increased by approximately 13 million in 2014 primarily due to increased numbers of commercial card customers and increased usage of those cards this was offset by a decrease of approximately 3 million in exchange and other fees 

loan sales and servicing income remained relatively flat increasing only 55 in 2015 compared to 2014 income from loan sales and servicing remained low in 2015 and 2014 compared to prior periods as the company is continuing to retain more of its loan production than in previous years loan sales and servicing income decreased by 90 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease was mainly caused by decreased income from residential mortgage loan sales in 2014 compared to 2013 in 2014 the company and the industry experienced a reduction in the volume of new residential loan originations primarily for refinanced mortgages in response we decided to retain more newlyoriginated loans on our balance sheet rather than sell them in order to fund them using some of our excess balance sheet liquidity to improve net interest income 

capital markets and foreign exchange income includes trading income public finance fees foreign exchange income and other capital market related fees in 2015 capital markets and foreign exchange income increased by 31 million due to an increase of approximately 34 million in bond origination fees in 2014 capital markets and foreign exchange income decreased by 55 million due primarily to a 18 million decrease in trading income and a 17 million decrease in bond origination fees from clients due to lower levels of financing activity 

dividends and other investment income declined by 135 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of writedowns on certain peis in 2014 dividends and other investment income declined by 25 million compared to 2013 

fair value and nonhedge derivative loss improved by 113 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of not having any fees associated with the total return swap “trs” that was terminated effective april 28 2014 and an improvement in the derivative fair value credit adjustments in 2014 fair value and nonhedge derivative loss 

improved by 68 million compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the termination of the trs partially offset by losses on derivative fair value credit adjustments 

during 2015 we recorded 119 million of equity securities gains compared to 135 million in 2014 and 85 million in 2013 the decrease in 2015 was primarily a result of decreased income from our nonsbic investments partially offset by an increase in gains related to our sbic investments the increase in 2014 was driven by unrealized gains related to appreciation of our sbic equity investments 

in 2015 we recorded a fixed income securities loss of 1387 million compared to a gain of 104 million in 2014 during the second quarter of 2015 we sold the remaining portfolio of our cdo securities or 574 million at amortized cost and realized net losses of approximately 137 million the fixed income securities gain of 104 million in 2014 was primarily from paydowns and payoffs of the cdo securities 

other noninterest income increased by 32 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result from the gain on sale of a branch in california other noninterest income decreased by 100 million in 2014 primarily due to gains in 2013 related to certain loans which had been purchased from failed banks covered by fdic losssharing agreements as well as gains from branch deposit and asset sales 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense decreased by 39 to 16005 million in 2015 compared to 16653 million in 2014 in 2014 we redeemed considerable amounts of our longterm debt and incurred debt extinguishment costs that were significantly higher than those incurred during 2015 other noninterest expense also decreased by approximately 395 million in 2015 primarily as a result of reductions in writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset fees related to professional and legal services declined by 156 million in 2015 due to a decline in consulting fees these decreases in expense were partially offset by a 163 million or 17 increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2015 as a result of an increase in employee base salaries 

schedule 5 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

schedule 5 

noninterest expense 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 163 million or 17 in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in base salaries resulted in part from increased headcount related to our major systems projects and buildout of our enterprise risk management and stress testing functions partially offset by reductions elsewhere staff involved in those projects tend to be in more highly compensated roles than positions in which reductions occurred our 

headcount decreased from 10462 fte employees to 10200 as of december 31 2015 during 2015 we incurred severance costs of approximately 11 million compared to approximately 9 million in 2014 salaries and employee benefits increased by 48 in 2014 compared to 2013 for similar reasons to those in 2015 

schedule 6 

salaries and employee benefits 



furniture equipment and software expense increased by 79 million in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase was primarily due to an increase in amortization of purchased software and an increase in our maintenance agreements as a result of our continued investment in the business furniture equipment and software expense increased by 87 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase was due to an increase in our maintenance agreements added licenses and contract renewals for a variety of vendors 

professional and legal services decreased in 2015 by 156 million or 236 from 2014 the decrease was due to a decline in consulting fees primarily related to our ccar submission in 2014 fees related to professional and legal services declined by 20 million or 29 due a decline in legal fees partially offset by an increase in consulting fees 

fdic premiums increased by 22 million or 68 in 2015 compared to 2014 fdic premiums decreased in 2014 by 58 million or 153 from 2013 most of the decrease in 2014 was due to reduced assessment rates resulting from improved credit quality of our loan portfolio and improved capital adequacy 

the fdic has proposed a change in deposit insurance assessments that implements a doddfrank act provision requiring banks with over 10 billion in assets to be responsible for recapitalizing the fdic insurance fund to 135 of insured deposits by the end of 2018 after it reaches a 115 reserve ratio if the rule is finalized it may go into effect in the first half of 2016 and is expected to increase our fdic assessment by approximately 510 million per year 

in both 2015 and 2014 we reduced longterm debt through tender offers early calls and maturities the tender offers in 2014 resulted in debt extinguishment cost of 444 million compared to 25 million in 2015 in 2013 we incurred 1202 million of debt extinguishment cost due the extinguishment of several longterm debt instruments for more information see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other noninterest expense decreased by 395 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and by 192 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the decline is primarily the result of decreased writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset and an increased amount of insurance recoveries the balance of fdicsupported loans declined significantly in 2014 

in 2015 we held adjusted noninterest expense below 16 billion and plan to do the same in 2016 with a slight increase to noninterest expense in 2017 the expense items that we exclude from the targeted noninterest expense of 

16 billion are the same as those excluded in arriving at the efficiency ratio see “gaap to nongaap reconciliations” on page 76 for more information regarding the calculation of the efficiency ratio 

income taxes 

income tax expense was 1424 million in 2015 2229 million in 2014 and 1429 million in 2013 our effective income tax rates including the effects of noncontrolling interests were 315 in 2015 359 in 2014 and 351 in 2013 the tax expense rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance the rate reductions in 2014 were offset by the reduction in the amount of tax credits generated and the inclusion of approximately 3 million of taxrelated interest expense in income tax expense on the financial statements the interest paid related to various notices and to the closure of various federal and state audits further the tax rate in 2015 decreased significantly as a result of the company’s investments in alternative energy and technology initiatives 

we had a net dta balance of approximately 203 million at december 31 2015 compared to 224 million at december 31 2014 the decrease in the net dta resulted primarily from items related to loan chargeoffs in excess of loan loss provisions and fair value adjustments on security sales the net decrease in dta was partially offset by a decrease in the deferred tax liabilities related to the debt exchange from 2009 

we did not record any additional valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2015 see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 80 for additional information 

preferred stock dividends and redemption 

in 2015 we incurred preferred stock dividends of 629 million a decrease of 90 million from 2014 in 2014 we incurred preferred stock dividends of 719 million a decrease of 236 million from 2013 in november 2015 we redeemed 176 million of series i preferred stock pursuant to a cash tender offer announced in october 2015 assuming no further tender offers the preferred dividends for 2016 are expected to be 117 million in the first and third quarters and 151 million in the second and fourth quarters respectively however the company’s 2015 capital plan which runs through the second quarter of 2016 allows for an additional use of up to 120 million of cash for preferred stock redemptions subject to retained earnings levels see further details in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases 

schedule 2   which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of our interest earning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another goal is to 

maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets such as money market investments or securities while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets as a result of slower economic growth accompanied by moderate loan demand in previous periods the company’s initiative to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets caused us to deploy excess funds into security purchases and redemptions of long termterm debt 

average interestearning assets were 544 billion in 2015 compared to 520 billion in the previous year average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 937 in 2015 and 931 in 2014 

average loans were 402 billion in 2015 and 395 billion in 2014 average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 692 in 2015 compared to 707 in 2014 primarily driven by a change in the mix of interestearning assets due to purchases of term investment securities that outpaced loan growth in 2015 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold and security resell agreements increased by 05 to 83 billion in 2015 compared to 82 billion in 2014 average securities increased by 407 from 2014 average total deposits increased by 51 while average total loans increased by 16 in 2015 when compared to 2014

investment securities portfolio 

we invest in securities to actively manage liquidity and interest rate risk in addition to generating revenues for the company refer to the “liquidity risk management” section on page 68 for additional information on management of liquidity and funding and compliance with basel iii and lcr requirements the following schedule presents a profile of our investment securities portfolio the amortized cost amounts represent the original cost of the investments adjusted for related accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments and for impairment losses including creditrelated impairment the estimated fair value measurement levels and methodology are discussed in note 20   of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedule 8 

investment securities portfolio 

the amortized cost of investment securities at december 31 2015 increased by 770 from the balances at december 31 2014 primarily due to purchases of agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities there were additional increases in agency securities and sba loanbacked securities these increases were partially offset by the sale of the remaining bank and insurance trust preferred cdo portfolio during the second quarter of 2015 

the investment securities portfolio includes 376 million of net premium almost exclusively from sba loanbacked securities and agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities recent purchases of these securities have occurred at a premium to the respective par amount the amortization of these premiums each quarter is dependent upon borrower prepayment behavior premium amortization for 2015 was approximately 51 million compared to approximately 23 million in 2014 and is included in portfolio yields the increased premium amortization is due to both an increased amount of agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities and sba loanbacked securities and changes in prepayment rates of the underlying loans 

during the first  quarter of 2015  we reclassified all of the remaining heldtomaturity cdo securities or approximately 79 million  at amortized cost to afs securities see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this reclassification 

as of december 31 2015 under the gaap fair value accounting hierarchy 08 of the 76 billion fair value of the afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 992 was valued at level 2 and there were no level 3 afs securities as a result of the sale of the remaining cdo securities at december 31 2014 27 of the 38 billion fair value of afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 868 was valued at level 2 and 105 was valued at level 3 see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value accounting 

schedule 9 presents the maturities of the different types of investments that we owned and the corresponding average yield as of december 31 2015 based on amortized cost expected maturities rather than contractual maturities are shown for sba securities agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities and certain agency and municipal securities see “liquidity risk management” on page 68 and notes 1 5 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our investment securities and their management

exposure to state and local governments 

we provide multiple products and services to state and local governments referred together as “municipalities” including deposit services loans and investment banking services and we invest in securities issued by the municipalities 

schedule 10 summarizes the company’s exposure to state and local municipalities 

schedule 10 

municipalities 

  

at december 31 2015 1 million of loans to one municipality were on nonaccrual a significant amount of the municipal loan and lease portfolio is secured by real estate and equipment and approximately 87 of the outstanding credits were originated by zions bank cbt amegy and vectra see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans 

growth in municipal exposures came primarily from increases in the municipal afs securities portfolio consistent with the company’s initiative to increase securities afs securities generally consist of rated securities with investment grade ratings from one or more major credit rating agencies htm securities consist of unrated bonds issued by small local government entities prior to purchase the issuers of municipal securities are evaluated by the company for their creditworthiness and some of the securities are guaranteed by third parties 

foreign exposure and operations 

our credit exposure to foreign sovereign risks and total foreign credit exposure is not significant we also do not have significant foreign exposure to derivative counterparties we have foreign operations as a result of our branch in grand cayman grand cayman islands bwi while deposits in this branch are not subject to frb reserve requirements there are no federal or state income tax benefits to the company or any customers as a result of these operations foreign deposits at december 31 2015 and 2014 were 294 million and 328 million respectively 

loans held for sale 

loans held for sale consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market were 150 million at december 31 2015 compared to 133 million at december 31 2014 consumer loans are primarily fixedrate mortgages that are originated and sold to third parties 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2015 net loans and leases accounted for 681 of total assets compared to 700 at the end of 2014 schedule 11 presents our loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2015 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in a small number of cases we have hedged the repricing characteristics of our variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 63 

schedule 11   

loan portfolio by type and maturity 

as of december 31 2015 net loans and leases were 407 billion reflecting a 15 increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations as well as a decrease in paydowns of existing loans 

most of the loan portfolio growth during 2015 occurred in   municipal cre term 14 family residential and home equity credit line loans “hecl” the impact of these increases was partially offset by declines in commercial owner occupied and cre construction loans the loan portfolio increased primarily at cbt nbaz and vectra while balances declined at nsb 

of the significant increases within the portfolio municipal loans increased approximately 155 million cre term loans increased 388 million and 14 family residential loans increased 181 million due in part to an increase in loan production the increase in loans occurred across the company’s geographic footprint 

commercial owner occupied loans declined approximately 202 million due to the runoff and attrition of the national real estate portfolio at zions bank which is not expected to continue at the same pace in 2016 the national real estate business is a wholesale business that depends upon loan referrals from other community banking institutions due to generally soft loan demand nationally many community banking institutions are retaining rather than selling their loan production 

we expect slighttomoderate overall loan and lease growth during 2016 primarily in consumer and commercial and industrial loans partially offset by continued attrition from the national real estate and oil and gasrelated loan portfolios we also expect to continue to limit construction and land development loan commitment growth for the 

foreseeable future as part of management’s actions to improve the risk profile of the company and to reduce portfolio concentration risk 

loans serviced for the benefit of others increased to 30 billion during 2015 from 27 billion in 2014 

since 2009 cbt and nsb have had losssharing agreements with the fdic that provided indemnification for credit losses of acquired loans and foreclosed assets up to specified thresholds the last of the agreements for commercial loans which comprised the major portion of the acquired portfolio expired as of september 30 2014 the agreements for 14 family residential loans will expire in 2019 in previous periods the fdicsupported loan balances were presented separately in schedules within mda and in other disclosures and included purchase creditimpaired “pci” loans as discussed in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements due to declining balances for all periods presented herein the fdicsupportedpci loans have been reclassified to their respective loan segments and classes 

other noninterestbearing investments 

as part of our initiative to consolidate our charters into a single charter we will have shares in a single fhlb des moines and we expect to redeem outstanding shares of the other respective fhlbs most likely in the second quarter of 2016 our investment balance in federal reserve stock is expected to remain relatively stable schedule 12 sets forth our other noninterestbearing investments 

schedule 12 

other noninterestbearing investments 



premises and equipment 

premises and equipment increased 76 million or 91 from the prior year primarily due to an increase of 47 million in buildings and 56 million in software partially offset by an increase in depreciation of 30 million the capitalized costs associated with buildings were primarily from the development of a new corporate facility for amegy in texas the increase in software was mainly due to the capitalization of eligible costs related to the development of new lending deposit and reporting systems 

deposits 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company average total deposits increased by 51 during 2015 with average interestbearing deposits decreasing by 23 and average noninterestbearing deposits increasing 90 the average interest rate paid for interestbearing deposits was 1 bp higher in 2015 than in 2014 

deposits at december 31 2015 excluding time deposits 100000 and over and brokered deposits increased by 58 or 27 billion from december 31 2014 the increase was mainly due to an increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits interestbearing domestic savings and money market and foreign deposits offset by a decrease in time deposits under 100000 

demand and savings and money market deposits comprised 952 of total deposits at december 31 2015 compared with 943 at december 31 2014 

during 2015 and 2014 we maintained a relatively low level of brokered deposits with the primary purpose of keeping that funding source available in case of a future need at december 31 2015 total deposits included 119 million of brokered deposits compared to 108 million at december 31 2014 

see notes 11 and 12   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity risk management” on page 68 for additional information on funding and borrowed funds 

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of our operations management of risk is an integral part of our operations and is also a key determinant of our overall performance the board of directors has appointed a risk oversight committee “roc” that consists of appointed board members who oversee the company’s risk management processes the roc meets on a regular basis to monitor and review enterprise risk management “erm” activities as required by its charter the roc performs oversight for various erm activities and approves erm policies and activities as detailed in the roc charter 

management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks these risks are overseen by the various management committees of which the ermc is the focal point for the monitoring and review of enterprise risk

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

the board of directors through the roc is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the credit risk of the company in addition the roc oversees and monitors adherence to key policies and the credit risk appetite which is defined in the risk appetite framework additionally the board has established the credit administration committee “cac” chaired by the chief credit officer and consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk for the company 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit administration and credit examination functions at the parent we separate the lending function from the credit administration function which strengthens control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level in addition we have a welldefined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio and we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies credit examination reports are submitted to management and to the roc on a regular basis new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the new product review committee 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally emphasis is placed on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio we attempt to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty generally our loan portfolio is well diversified however due to the nature of our geographical footprint there are 

certain significant concentrations primarily in commercial real estate “cre” and oil and gasrelated lending we have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending leveraged lending municipal lending and oil and gasrelated lending all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary the recent growth in construction and land development loan commitments is within the established concentration limits our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographical footprint of our banking affiliates 

the credit quality of our loan portfolio slightly deteriorated during 2015 nonperforming lendingrelated assets at december 31 2015 increased by approximately 96 from december 31 2014 gross chargeoffs for 2015 increased to 139 million from 106 million in 2014 however net chargeoffs decreased to 39 million from 42 million for the same periods 

as displayed in schedule 13 commercial and industrial loans were the largest category and constituted 325 of our loan portfolio at december 31 2015 construction and land development loans slightly decreased to 45 of total loans at december 31 2015 compared to 50 at december 31 2014

government agency guaranteed loans 

we participate in various guaranteed lending programs sponsored by us government agencies such as the sba federal housing authority veterans’ administration exportimport bank of the us and the us department of agriculture as of december 31 2015 the principal balance of these loans was 569 million and the guaranteed portion was approximately 432 million most of these loans were guaranteed by the sba

 oil and gasrelated exposure 

various industries represented in the previous schedule including mining quarrying and oilgas extraction manufacturing and transportation and warehousing contain certain loans we categorized as oil and gasrelated at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had approximately 48 billion and 58 billion of total oil and gasrelated credit exposure respectively the distribution of oil and gasrelated loans by customer market segment is shown in schedule 16 

schedule 16 

oil and gasrelated exposure 1   





 during 2015 our overall balance of oil and gasrelated loans decreased approximately 451 million or 147 to 26 billion primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns exploration and production loan balances decreased 223 and energy services loan balances declined 207 unfunded oil and gasrelated lending commitments declined by 549 million or 203 the decline in oil and gasrelated credit exposure during 2015 was consistent with expectations and further attrition over the next several quarters is likely 

as expected the credit quality of the oil and gas loan portfolio deteriorated during 2015 and will likely continue throughout 2016 due to low energy prices at december 31 2015 approximately 662 million or 25 of the oil and gasrelated loan balances were nonaccruing compared to approximately 166 million or 05 at december 31 2014 approximately 71 of oil and gasrelated nonaccruing loans were current as to principal and interest payments at december 31 2015 up from approximately 62 at december 31 2014 

classified oil and gasrelated credits increased to 5175 million at december 31 2015 from 1336 million at december 31 2014 oil and gasrelated loan net chargeoffs were 425 million for 2015 compared to 88 million for 2014 the majority of loan downgrades during 2015 reflected deterioration in the financial condition of oilfield services companies and to a lesser degree a small number of downgrades in the upstream portfolio further downgrades are likely however we currently believe we have established an appropriate reserve for the portfolio the pattern of a significant increase in graded or classified oil and gas loans as well as the increase in nonaccrual oil and gas loans is generally consistent with prior cycles 

upstream 

upstream exploration and production loans comprised approximately 31 and 34 of the oil and gasrelated loans at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively many upstream borrowers have relatively balanced production between oil and gas 

we use disciplined underwriting practices to mitigate the risk associated with upstream lending activities upstream loans are made to reservebased borrowers where approximately 90 of those loans are collateralized by the value of the borrower’s oil and gas reserves our oil and gas price deck the pricing applied to a borrower’s reserves for underwriting purposes has generally been below the nymex strip ie the average of the daily settlement prices of the next 12 months’ futures contracts through the use of independent and third party engineers and conservative underwriting we apply multiple discounts these discounts often range from 1040 of the value of the collateral in determining the borrowing base commitment and help protect credit quality against significant commodity price declines further reservebased commitments are subject to a borrowing base redetermination based on thencurrent energy prices typically every six months generally we have at our option the right to conduct additional redeterminations during the year borrowing bases for clients are usually set at 6070 of available collateral after an adjustment for the discounts described above   

upstream borrowers generally do not draw the maximum available funding on their lines which provides the borrower additional liquidity and flexibility the line utilization rate for upstream borrowers was approximately 57 and 58 at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively this unused commitment gives us the ability in some cases to reduce the borrowing base commitment through the redetermination process without creating a borrowing base deficiency where outstanding debt exceeds the new borrowing base nevertheless our loan agreements generally require the borrowers to maintain a certain amount of equity therefore if the loan to collateral value exceeds an acceptable limit we work with the borrowers to reinstate an acceptable collateralvalue threshold as a result of the fall 2015 redetermination of exploration and production oil and gasrelated loan borrowing bases the borrowing base for total exploration and production commitments including new commitments declined approximately 21 since the fall 2014 redetermination 

an additional metric we consider in our underwriting is a borrower’s oil and gas price hedging practices a considerable portion of our reservebased borrowers are hedged as of december 31 2015 of the upstream borrower’s riskbased estimated oil production and gas production projected in 2016 approximately 61 and 43 respectively is hedged based on the latest data provided by the borrowers 

midstream 

midstream marketing and transportation loans comprised approximately 23 and 19 of the oil and gasrelated exposure at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively loans in this segment are made to companies that gather transport treat and blend oil and natural gas or that provide services to similar companies the assets owned by these borrowers which make this activity possible are fieldlevel gathering systems small diameter pipe pipelines mediumlarge diameter pipe tanks trucks rail cars various waterbased vessels and natural gas treatment plants our midstream loans are secured by these assets unless the borrower is rated investmentgrade a significant portion of our midstream borrowers’ revenues are derived from feebased contracts giving them limited exposure to commodity price risk since lower oil and gas prices slow the drilling and development of new oil and natural gas but do not normally result in significant numbers of producing wells being shut in volumes of oil and gas flowing through midstream systems usually remain relatively stable throughout oil and natural gas price cycles 

energy services 

energy services loans which include oilfield services and energy service manufacturing comprised approximately 39 and 41 of the oil and gasrelated exposure at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively energy services loans include borrowers that have a concentration of revenues in the energy industry however many of these borrowers provide a broad range of products and services to the energy industry and are not subject to the same volatility as new drilling activities many of these borrowers are diversified geographically and service both oil and gasrelated drilling and production 

for energy services loans underwriting criteria require lower leverage to compensate for the cyclical nature of the industry during the underwriting process we use sensitivity analysis to consider revenue and cash flow impacts resulting from oil and gas price cycles generally we underwrite energy services loans to withstand a 2050 decline in cash flows with higher discounts for those borrowers subject to greater cyclicality 

risk management of the oil and gasrelated portfolio 

we apply concentration limits and disciplined underwriting to the entire oil and gasrelated loan portfolio to limit our risk exposure concentration limits on oil and gasrelated lending coupled with adherence to our underwriting standards served to constrain loan growth during the past several quarters as an indicator of the diversity in the size of our oil and gasrelated portfolio the average amount of our commitments is approximately 7 million with approximately 64 of the commitments less than 30 million additionally there are instances where we have commitments to a common sponsor which when combined would result in higher commitment levels than 30 million the portfolio contains only senior loans – no junior or second lien positions additionally we cautiously approach making firstlien loans to borrowers that employ excessive leverage through the use of junior lien loans or unsecured layers of debt approximately 90 of the total oil and gasrelated portfolio is secured by reserves equipment real estate and other collateral or a combination of collateral types 

we participate as a lender in loans and commitments designated as shared national credits “sncs” which generally consist of larger and more diversified borrowers that have better access to capital markets sncs are loans or loan commitments of at least 20 million that are shared by three or more federally supervised institutions the percentage of sncs is approximately 72 of the upstream portfolio 72 of the midstream portfolio and 47 of the energy services portfolio our bankers have direct access and contact with the management of these snc borrowers and as such are active participants in many cases we provide ancillary banking services to these borrowers further evidencing this direct relationship 

as a secondary source of support many of our oil and gasrelated borrowers have access to capital markets and private equity sources private sponsors tend to be large funds often with assets under management of more than 1 billion managed by individuals with a great deal of energy expertise and experience and who have successfully managed energy investments through previous energy price cycles the investors in the funds are primarily institutional investors such as large pensions foundations trusts and high net worth family offices 

we expect further downgrades in the oil and gas portfolio primarily from the oilfield services companies although we currently believe we have appropriately reserved for these downgrades the deterioration of oil and gasrelated credits is transpiring consistently with our outlook and expectations from late 2014 although future energy price volatility may result in further credit deterioration when establishing the level of the allowance for credit losses“acl” we consider multiple factors including reduced drilling activity and additional capital raises during 2015 we increased the acl on the oil and gas portfolio by approximately 74 million primarily due to the decline in energy prices which contributed to an increased provision for loan losses in 2015

approximately 24 of the cre term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2015 for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to seven years the remaining 76 of cre loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project loantovalue ratio and occupancy rates   

approximately 142 million or 12 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2015 consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements required equity infusions upon a decline in value of the collateral are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily projects we look for substantial preleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan significant consideration is given to the likely market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered and validated independent of the loan officer and the borrower generally by our internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used appraisals are ordered from outside appraisers at the inception renewal or for cre loans upon the occurrence of any event causing a downgrade to an adverse grade ie “criticized” or “classified” we increase the frequency of obtaining updated appraisals for adversely graded credits when declining market conditions exist 

advance rates ie loan commitments will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and homes not under contract and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally loanbyloan reviews of passgrade loans for all commercial and residential construction and land development loans are performed semiannually at all affiliates except tcbw which performs such reviews annually 

cre loans are sometimes modified to increase the likelihood of collecting the maximum possible amount of our investment in the loan in general the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing a loan for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes into consideration this repayment source 

additionally when we modify or extend a loan we give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether we have granted a concession in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists however if additional collateral is obtained or if a strong guarantor exists who is believed to be able and willing to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation performance of other related projects with which we are familiar and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared to the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

due to the oil and gas price volatility there could be a potential adverse impact on our cre loan portfolio within texas our largest credit exposures are to the office multifamily and hospitality sectors in the city of houston 

consumer loans 

we have mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality historically our practice has been to sell “conforming” fixedrate loans to third parties including fannie mae and freddie mac for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards it has also been our practice historically to hold variablerate loans in our portfolio we actively monitor loan “putbacks” required repurchases of loans previously sold to fannie mae or freddie mac due to inadequate documentation or other reasons loan putbacks have been minimal over a multipleyear period we estimate that we do not have any material risk as a result of either our foreclosure practices or loan putbacks and we have not established any reserves related to these items 

we are engaged in hecl lending at december 31 2015 and 2014 our hecl portfolio totaled 24 billion and 23 billion respectively schedule 18 shows the composition of our hecl portfolio by lien status 

schedule 18 

hecl portfolio by lien status 



as of december 31 2015 loans representing approximately 2 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateral value at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination 

approximately 95 of our hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 31 is scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years we regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates the analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment the annualized credit losses for the hecl portfolio were 2 bps and 5 bps for 2015 and 2014 respectively see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit quality of this portfolio 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming lendingrelated assets as a percentage of loans and leases and oreo increased slightly to 087 at december 31 2015 compared with 081 at december 31 2014 

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2015 increased by 43 million from the prior year primarily due to deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio excluding oil and gasrelated loans nonperforming assets have increased in the cre term loan class but have declined in the commercial owner occupied and construction and land development loan classes the largest total decreases in nonaccrual loans occurred at cbt 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” on page 60 for more information company policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to cre term loans see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

 restructured loans 

troubled debt restructuring “tdr” are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties and for which we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider tdrs declined approximately 134 during 2015 primarily due to payments and payoffs commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such consumer loan tdrs may include firstlien residential mortgage loans and 

home equity loans 

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether or not a loan should be returned to accrual status 

schedule 20 

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 



in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure company policy requires that the removal of tdr status be approved at the same management level that approved the upgrading of a loan’s classification see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs

allowance for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance our loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 



the total alll remained relatively unchanged during 2015 due to deterioration within the oil and gas portfolio which was offset by improvements in credit quality metrics outside of the oil and gas portfolio however during 2015 we increased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to account for the increased risk of loss on loans likely to be affected by the sharp decline in oil prices and more moderate decline in natural gas prices that occurred during the year 

the total alll at december 31 2014 decreased by 141 million compared to december 31 2013 the decreases in the alll reflected improvements in credit quality trends somewhat improving economic conditions in some of our markets and reductions in construction and land development loans during 2014 we decreased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to reflect the positive credit quality trends and stabilizing economic conditions 

the rulc represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is separately shown in our balance sheet and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are shown separately in the statement of income the reserve decreased by 62 million during 2015 primarily due to the funding of one large impaired letter of credit partially offset by the proportionally large amount of unfunded commitments in the oil and gas portfolio compared to the rest of the portfolio 

see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acl and credit trends experienced in each portfolio segment 

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company including interest rate and market risk management in addition the board establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews limit exceptions reported by management the board has established the assetliability committee “alco” consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the company alco is primarily responsible for managing interest rate and market risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have net interest income increase in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise 

due to the low level of rates there is limited sensitivity to falling rates at the current time and we have tended to operate near interest rate risk “triggers” and appetites to be appropriately positioned in light of prevailing market conditions in order to maximize shareholder value however if interest rates remain at their current historically low levels given our asset sensitivity we would expect the nim to be under continuing modest pressure assuming a balance sheet that is static in size additionally market participants have recently contemplated the possibility of negative rates in the us markets which would likely have a more negative impact on the nim in order to mitigate this pressure we have been deploying cash into shorttomedium duration agency passthrough securities additionally we have increased the use of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to synthetically convert floatingrate assets to fixedrate over time these actions are expected to somewhat reduce our asset sensitivity compared to previous periods while improving current earnings 

interest rate risk measurement 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods net interest income simulation and economic value of equity at risk “eve” in the net interest income simulation method we analyze the expected change in net interest income in response to changes in interest rates in the eve method we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates 

net interest income simulation is an estimate of the total net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income is measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio eg a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lower rate environment our policy contains a trigger for a 10 decline in rate sensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13 decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps this trigger and risk capacity apply to both the fast and the slow deposit assumptions 

eve is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities we measure changes in the dollar amount of eve for parallel shifts in interest rates due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in eve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney interest rate caps or limits on loans which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for low rate mortgages in a higher rate environment 

the following schedule presents the formal eve limits we have adopted exceptions to the eve limits are subject to notification and approval by the roc in the normal course of business we evaluated our limits and made changes to reflect its current balance sheet management objectives these changes are reflected in the following schedule 

schedule 24 

economic value of equity decline limits 



new interest rate risk model and comparisons 

in the first quarter of 2015 we adopted a new model to estimate the impact to net interest income and to eve from changes in interest rates we made the change because the new model is believed to better reflect customer behavior particularly with regard to dynamic prepayment speeds ie incrementally slower prepayment speeds on mortgages with incrementally higher interest rate changes and deposit characteristics ie faster deposit product migration to interestbearing accounts for larger deposit balances we ran both models in parallel for several months and members of alco scrutinized the results additionally rigorous statistical validation of the new model was conducted prior to its adoption 

regardless of the model used estimating the impact on net interest income and eve requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration eg customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit competitive pricing eg existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates loan and security prepayments and the effects of other similar embedded options as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans we estimate ranges of possible net interest income and eve results under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions 

used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options we use historical regression analysis as a guide to setting such assumptions however due to the current low interest rate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit durations may not reflect actual future results additionally competition for funding in the marketplace has and may again result in changes of deposit pricing on interestbearing accounts that is greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as libor or the federal funds rate 

under most rising interest rate environments we would expect some customers to move balances in demand deposits to interestbearing accounts such as money market savings or cds the models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration in order to capture the sensitivity of our models to this risk we estimate a range of possible outcomes for interest sensitivity under “fast” and “slow” movements of client funds out of noninterestbearing deposits and into interestbearing sources of funds 

in addition we assume certain correlation rates often referred to as a “deposit beta” of interestbearing deposits wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared to changes in benchmark interest rates generally certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate while interestonchecking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate actual results may differ materially due to factors including competitive pricing money supply credit worthiness of the company and so forth however we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions the aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in schedule 25 

schedule 25 

deposit assumptions 



as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in net interest income based on a static balance sheet size in the first year after the interest rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

schedule 26 

income simulation – change in net interest income 



 

for comparative purposes we applied the new model to the december 31 2014 balances these results are presented in the following schedule 

the decrease from december 31 2014 in interest rate sensitivity for upward shocks in rates was driven by 

purchases of securities addition of swap contracts in which we receive a fixed rate and the previously mentioned changes in modeled demand deposit behavior for the down 100bp shock interest rate sensitivity increased due to the fact that negative shocked rates are not allowed as the fed funds target rate was 025 as of december 31 2014 and 050 as of december 31 2015 the 100bp shock as of the latter date represented a larger shock for shortterm rates 



 

as of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in eve under parallel interest rate changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps 

schedule 27 

changes in economic value of equity 



 

for comparative purposes we applied the new model to the december 31 2014 balances these results are presented in the following schedulethe drivers of changes in the eve are the same as cited above for net interest income 



 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 80 and 78 respectively of the company’s commercial lending and cre portfolios were variablerate and primarily tied to either the prime rate or libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have variable interest rates see schedule 11 for further information on fixed and variable interest rates of the loan portfolio 

largely due to competitive pressures the favorable impact on loan yield from the use of interest rate floors has diminished as of december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 33 and 37 respectively of all of the company’s variablerate loan balances contain floors of the loans with floors approximately 44 and 55 of the balances at these same respective dates were priced at the floor rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 033 and 053 respectively 

at december 31 2015 the company held 1388 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements see notes 7 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

market risk – fixed income 

we engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2015 we had a relatively small amount 48 million of trading assets and 30 million of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 71 million and 24 million at december 31 2014 

we are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value we are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2015 the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs and htm securities improved by 74 million compared to a 77 million improvement in the same prior year period 

market risk – equity investments 

through our equity investment activities we own equity securities that are publicly traded in addition we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and fhlbs that are not publicly traded the accounting for equity investments may use the cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs we are exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee consisting of members of management 

we hold both direct and indirect investments in predominately prepublic companies through various predominantly sbic venture capital funds our equity exposure to these investments was approximately 113 million at december 31 2015 and 86 million at december 31 2014 on occasion some of the companies within our sbic investments may issue an initial public offering in this case the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment which can introduce additional market risk as of december 31 2015 we had direct sbic investments of approximately 25 million of publicly traded stocks 

additionally amegy has an alternative investments portfolio these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds are generally not a part of the strategy because the underlying companies are typically not creditworthy the carrying value of amegy ’ s equity investments was 21 million at december 31 2015 and 38 million at december 31 2014 

these peis are subject to the provisions of the doddfrank act the vr of the doddfrank act as published in december 2013 and amended in january 2014 prohibits banks and bank holding companies from holding peis beyond july 21 2016 as currently extended except for sbic funds the frb has announced its intention to grant an additional oneyear extension to july 21 2017 as of december 31 2015 such prohibited peis amounted to 18 million with an additional 7 million of unfunded commitments see notes 5 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information we currently do not believe that this divestiture requirement will ultimately have a material impact on our financial statements 

our earnings from these investments and the potential volatility of these earnings are expected to decline over the next several years and will ultimately cease 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that our cash flows may not be adequate to fund our ongoing operations and meet our commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet our anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines such as the “timetorequired funding” and lcr that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and zb na as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the parent and zb na liquidity 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally for the parent and jointly by the parent and bank management for its subsidiary bank the treasury department performs this management centrally under the direction of the corporate treasurer with oversight by alco the treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the company’s liquidity policy these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policy also must be approved by the company’s ermc and the board of directors the company has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk the policy requires the company to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows as the result of a severe liquidity crisis the company targets a buffer of highly liquid assets at the parent to cover 1824 months of cash outflows under a scenario with limited cash inflows and maintains a minimum policy limit of not less than 12 months the company’s banking subsidiary zb na exceeds the regulatory requirements of the modified lcr that mandates a buffer of hqla to cover 70 of 30day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated in the final liquidity rule additionally the company performs monthly liquidity stress testing using a set of internally generated scenarios representing severe liquidity constraints over a 12month horizon zb na maintains a buffer of highly liquid assets consisting of cash us agency and us government sponsored entity securities to cover 30day cash outflows under liquidity stress tests and maintains a contingency funding plan to identify funding sources that would be utilized over the extended 12month horizon throughout 2015 and as of december 31 2015 the company complied with this policy 

liquidity regulation 

in september 2014 us banking regulators issued a final rule that implements a quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the lcr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under this rule we are subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold an adequate amount of unencumbered high quality liquid assets “hqla” that can be converted into cash easily and immediately in private markets to meet its liquidity needs for a shortterm liquidity stress scenario this rule became applicable to us on january 1 2016 we have calculated that if the rule were applicable to us as of december 31 2015 we would be in compliance with the requirement to maintain a modified lcr of at least 100 

zions’ internal liquidity stress testing program as contained in its policy complies with the requirements of the enhanced prudential standards for liquidity management reg yy 

the basel iii liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” which requires a financial institution to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the characteristics of its on and offbalance sheet activities on october 31 2014 the basel committee on banking supervision issued its final standards for this ratio entitled basel iii the net stable funding ratio based upon this basel iii publication we believe we would meet the minimum nsfr if such requirement were currently effective however 

the frb has not yet proposed regulations to implement these basel committee standards we continue to monitor these developments 

contractual obligations 

schedule 28 summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2015  

schedule 28 

contractual obligations 



 

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 28 we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

we also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

liquidity management actions 

consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements at the parent and its subsidiaries decreased to 74 billion at december 31 2015  from 92 billion at december 31 2014  the 18 billion decrease during 2015  resulted primarily from 1 an increase in investment securities 2 net loan originations 3 repayment of longterm debt 4 tender offer and purchase of preferred stock and 5 dividends on common and preferred stock these decreases were partially offset by an increase in deposits and net cash provided by operating activities 

our afs investment securities increased by 38 billion during 2015 this increase was primarily due to the purchase of shorttomedium duration agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities partially offset by the sale of the remaining portfolio of cdo securities we have been adding to our investment portfolio as a result of the need for a permanent buffer of highly liquid assets to satisfy the new lcr rules and more broadly to maintain a sufficient buffer of highly liquid assets to meet projected liquidity needs under our monthly liquidity stress tests we expect to continue to deploy cash and shortterm investments into highly liquid assets in the next several quarters 

during 2015 we completed a tender offer to purchase 176 million of our series i preferred stock 

we made cash payments totaling 288 million during 2015 for our longterm debt which matured or were redeemed and did not incur any new longterm debt during the same time period see note 12 for additional detail about debt redemptions and maturities during 2015 

parent company liquidity – the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes and longterm debt and equity issuances 

cash and interestbearing deposits held as investments at the parent decreased to 08 billion at december 31 2015  from 10 billion at december 31 2014  the 02 billion decrease during 2015  was primarily a result of 1 repayment of longterm debt 2 tender offer and purchase of preferred stock and 3 dividends on common and preferred stock these decreases were partially offset by 1 dividends received from its subsidiary banks on  common  and preferred stock 2 net cash provided by operating activities and 3 a decrease in investment securities see notes 12 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our longterm debt and equity transactions 

during 2015  the parent received common dividends and return of common equity totaling 192 million and preferred dividends totaling 42 million from its subsidiary banks during 2014  the parent received from its subsidiary banks 190 million for common dividends and return of common equity and 46 million for preferred dividends at december 31 2015 zb na had approximately 604 million available for the payment of dividends under current capital regulations following the close of business on december 31 2015 we completed the merger of our subsidiary banks resulting in one bank with a legal name of zb national association see note 1 for a more detailed discussion the dividends that zb na can pay to the parent are restricted by current and historical earning levels retained earnings and riskbased and other regulatory capital requirements and limitations during 2015  all of our subsidiary banks recorded a profit we expect that this profitability will be sustained under the new single charter bank previously discussed thus permitting continued payments of dividends to the parent during 2016 although dividend capacity to the parent will change 

general financial market and economic conditions impact our access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the debt ratings and outlooks issued by the various rating agencies for the company did not change during 2015  except that moody’s upgraded the company’s subordinated debt to ba1 from ba2 and both moody’s and dominion bond rating service “dbrs” revised its outlook to positive from stable standard  poor’s fitch dbrs and kroll all rate the company’s senior debt at an investmentgrade level while moody’s rates the company’s senior debt as ba1 one notch below investmentgrade in addition all of the previously mentioned rating agencies except kroll rate the company’s subordinated debt as noninvestmentgrade

the parent’s cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses decreased to  51   million in 2015  from 96 million in 2014  as a result of a net repayment of longterm debt of 03 billion and 12 billion during 2015  and 2014  respectively cash payments for interest are expected to continue to decrease during 2016 as a result of the debt repayments during 2015 additionally the parent paid approximately 108 million and 96 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock for the same periods preferred stock dividends will decrease during 2016 as a result of the tender offer and purchase of approximately 176 million of our series i preferred stock 

note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and cash flows for 2015  2014  and 2013  as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2015  and 2014  

the parent’s longterm debt maturities during 2016 consist of 89 million senior notes due on june 20 2016 at december 31 2015  maturities of our longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from june 2016 to september 2028 with effective interest rates from 360 to 695 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of our longterm debt 

subsidiary bank liquidity – zb na’s primary source of funding is its core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits and time deposits under 250000 on a consolidated basis the company’s loan to total deposit ratio is 807 as of december 31 2015  compared to 837 as of december 31 2014  total deposits increased by 25 billion to 504 billion at december 31 2015 compared to 479 billion at december 31 2014 primarily due to a 17 billion increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits and a 11 billion increase in savings and money market deposits this increase was partially offset by a 276 million decrease in time deposits also during 2015 the subsidiary banks redeployed approximately 18 billion of interestbearing deposits and security resell agreements to shorttomedium duration agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities zb na’s longterm senior debt ratings were the same as the parent except standard  poor’s was bbb 

the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and from time to time have been a significant source of funding for each of our subsidiary banks subsequent to the charter consolidation on december 31 2015 zb na is a member of the fhlb of des moines the fhlb allows 

member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements the bank is required to invest in fhlb and federal reserve stock to maintain their borrowing capacity we do not believe that the subsidiary bank mergers will adversely impact bank liquidity or funding 

at december 31 2015  the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 134 billion the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings is not expected to decrease as a result of the subsidiary bank mergers loans with a carrying value of approximately 194 billion at december 31 2015  and 225 billion at december 31 2014  have been pledged at the federal reserve and various fhlbs as collateral for current and potential borrowings during 2015 we repaid our outstanding 22 million of longterm borrowings with the fhlb we had no shortterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding at december 31 2015  or december 31 2014  at december 31 2015 our total investment in fhlb and federal reserve stock was 68 million and 123 million respectively compared to 104 million and 121 million at december 31 2014 

our investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the asset liability management posture taken during 2015  htm  afs investment securities’ activities resulted in a net increase in investment securities and a net 38 billion decrease in cash compared with a net 71 million decrease in cash for 2014  

maturing balances in our subsidiary banks’ loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows lending and purchase activity for 2015  resulted in a net cash outflow of 06 billion compared to a net cash outflow of 11 billion for 2014  

during 2015  we paid income taxes of 132 million compared to 183 million during 2014  

operational risk management 

operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events in our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk we have an enterprise risk management department whose responsibility is to help employees management and the board of directors to assess understand measure and monitor risk in accordance with our risk appetite framework we have documented both controls and the control selfassessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

to manage and minimize our operational risk we have in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate our systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to those systems to our legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we undertake significant efforts to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters we also mitigate operational risk through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

we are continually improving our oversight of operational risk including enhancement of risk identification risk and control selfassessments and antifraud measures which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees the operational risk committee reports to the ermc which reports to the roc additional measures have been taken to increase oversight by enterprise risk management and operational risk management through the strengthening of new product reviews enhancements to the vendor management and vendor risk management framework enhancements to the business continuity and disaster recovery program and the establishment of fraud risk oversight incident response oversight and technology project oversight programs significant enhancements have also been made to governance and reporting including the establishment of policy and committee governance programs and the creation of an enterprise risk profile and operational risk profile 

the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our critical systems sometimes referred to as hacking cyberfraud cyberattacks cyberterrorism or other similar names also continue to grow on a daily basis the company its customers and other financial institutions are subject to a large number of such attempts we have established systems and procedures to monitor thwart or mitigate damage from such attempts however in some instances we or our customers have been victimized by cyberfraud our related losses have not been material or some of our customers have been temporarily unable to routinely access our online systems as a result of for example distributed denial of service attacks we continue to review this area of our operations to help ensure that we manage this risk in an effective manner 

capital management 

overview 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary bank other major cmc responsibilities include 

 the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and zb na to 

 

capital plan and stress tests 

the cmc oversees the company’s capital stress testing under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios we have established processes to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the company under hypothetical economic scenarios these stress tests facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity within quantitative limits reflecting the board of directors’ risk appetite these processes are also used to complete the company’s dfast as required by the doddfrank act and ccar as required by the federal reserve 

filing a capital plan with the federal reserve based on stress testing and documented sound policies processes models controls and governance practices and the subsequent review by the federal reserve is an annual regulatory requirement this capital plan which is subject to objection by the federal reserve governs all of the company’s capital and significant unsecured debt financing actions for a period of five quarters among the actions governed by the capital plan are the repurchase of outstanding capital securities and the timing of new capital issuances and whether the company can pay or increase dividends any such action not included in a capital plan 

to which the federal reserve has not objected cannot be executed without submission of a revised stress test and capital plan for federal reserve review and nonobjection de minimis changes are allowed without a complete plan resubmission subject to receipt of a federal reserve nonobjection regulations require company disclosure of these stress tests results 

we submitted our 2015 capital plan and stress test results to the frb on january 5 2015 in our capital plan we were required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios for nine quarters ending the fourth quarter of 2016 our estimated regulatory capital ratios including our tier 1 common ratio associated with the basel i capital rules our cet1 ratio under the basel iii capital rules and our gaap tangible common equity ratio on march 11 2015 we announced that the federal reserve notified us that it did not object to the capital actions outlined in our 2015 capital plan the plan included 1 the increase of the quarterly common dividend to 006 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2015 2 the continued payment of preferred dividends at the current rates and 3 up to 300 million in total reduction of preferred equity 

the company’s stress test results were significantly different from those modeled by the frb as the frb estimated that the company’s minimum tier 1 common ratio in the severely adverse scenario was 51 just above the 50 minimum since the release of the frb’s modeled results we have undertaken several actions designed in part to improve the company’s risk profile under the ccar stress tests these actions include selling parts of the investment portfolio extending the duration of the investment portfolio and limiting growth in certain loan categories which are perceived as risky in the ccar stress test 

during the second quarter of 2015 we completed our midcycle capital stress test as required under dfast the results demonstrated that we maintained sufficient capital to withstand a severe economic downturn detailed disclosure of the midcycle stress test results can be found on the company’s website 

as discussed subsequently we increased our common dividend to 006 in the second quarter of 2015 in november 2015 we purchased and retired 180 million of our series i preferred stock pursuant to a tender offer announced in october 2015 our 2015 capital plan which runs through the second quarter of 2016 allows for an additional use of up to 120 million of cash for preferred stock redemptions the ultimate determination of future preferred stock reductions will depend on a number of factors including market conditions and the receptivity of preferred investors to the terms of any preferred stock redemption offers as well as the effect of other steps we may explore as we seek to manage our capital in light of the most recent round of stress tests any of which could result in a reduction or delay of further preferred equity reductions we expect to manage any further reduction of preferred equity such that total tier 1 capital does not decline materially 

we are currently preparing our 2016 capital plan which is due to the federal reserve on april 5 2016 in addition our doddfrank act midcycle stress test based upon the company’s june 30 2016 financial position is due on october 5 2016 

basel iii 

the basel iii capital rules which effectively replaced the basel i rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the rules implement the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revised the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company compared to the basel i us riskbased capital rules 

under prior basel i capital standards the effects of aoci items included in capital were excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios as a “nonadvanced approaches banking organization” we made a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items as allowed under the basel iii capital rules 

we met all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules based upon a 2015 phasein as of december 31 2015 and believe that we would meet all capital adequacy requirements on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective 

a detailed discussion of basel iii requirements including implications for the company is contained on page 9 of the “capital standards – basel framework” section under part 1 item 1 in this annual report on form 10k 

capital management actions 

total shareholders’ equity increased by 19 from 74 billion at december 31 2014  to 75 billion at december 31 2015  the increase in total shareholders’ equity is primarily due to net income of 309 million and to the sale of the company’s remaining portfolio of cdo securities which was the primary driver of the 73 million increase in aoci this increase was partially offset by the 176 million tender offer and repurchase of a portion of our series i preferred stock and 108 million of dividends recorded on preferred and common stock 

the common dividend rate was increased to 006 per share during the second quarter of 2015 from 004 per share paid since the second quarter of 2013 we paid 452 million in dividends on common stock during 2015  compared to 313 million during 2014  during its february 2016 meeting the board of directors declared a dividend of 006 per common share payable on february 25 2016 to shareholders of record on february 18 2016 

we recorded preferred stock dividends of 629 million for 2015  and 719 million for 2014  dividends on preferred stock recorded in 2014 included accruals of 70 million preferred stock dividends will decrease during 2016 as a result of the purchase of 180 million of our series i preferred stock discussed previously and any subsequent preferred stock reduction allowed in our 2015 capital plan 

banking organizations are required by capital regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios the company’ capital ratios as of december 31 2015  under basel iii and december 31 2014  and 2013  under basel i are shown in schedule 31

note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information on riskbased capital 

at december 31 2015  basel iii regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital was 66 billion and 75 billion respectively basel i regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital at december 31 2014  was 66 billion and 74 billion respectively 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

1 basel i tier 1 common capital 

the basel i capital rules were replaced by the basel iii capital rules that became effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components the basel iii capital rules include the cet1 capital ratio which is the core capital component of the basel iii rules and a key ratio considered by regulators investors and analysts the calculation of the cet1 capital ratio as defined under basel iii rules is considered an acceptable ratio by gaap for financial institutions and accordingly does not require reconciliation to gaap 

there is a difference in the calculation of the cet1 capital ratio under basel iii rules and the calculation of the tier 1 common “t1c” capital ratio under basel i rules we present the calculation of key regulatory capital ratios including the t1c capital ratio using the governing definition at the end of each quarter taking into account applicable phasein rules 

while we were subject to basel i capital rules prior to 2015 the federal reserve and other banking regulators assessed a bank’s capital adequacy based on tier 1 capital the calculation of which was codified in federal banking regulations however basel i rules did not include a definition for t1c capital and thus it was considered a nongaap measure requiring reconciliation to gaap 

schedule 32 provides a reconciliation for prior periods of total shareholders’ equity gaap to tier 1 capital regulatory at the subject dates and to t1c capital nongaap using basel i us regulatory treatment and the resulting t1c capital ratio

4 efficiency ratio 

this annual report on form 10k presents an “efficiency ratio” whose calculation includes adjustments for certain line items and amounts in noninterest expense and noninterest income 

schedule 35 provides a reconciliation of noninterest expense gaap taxableequivalent net interest income gaap and noninterest income gaap to the efficiency ratio nongaap 

schedule 35 

efficiency ratio 



for items 2 3 and 4 the identified adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are included where applicable in financial results or in the balance sheet presented in accordance with gaap we consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and financial position 

we believe that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the nongaap financial measures provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which will assist regulators investors and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the company and in predicting future performance these nongaap financial measures are used by management to assess the performance of the company’s business or its financial position for evaluating bank reporting segment performance for presentations of the company’s performance to investors and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts we further believe that presenting these nongaap financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess our performance on the same basis as that applied by management 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company 

they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under gaap 

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the company’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements current accounting guidance has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the related life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the company’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs 

becoming unavailable when market data is not available the company would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors investment securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of otti otti is considered to have occurred if its fair value is below amortized cost and 1 we intend to sell the security or 2 it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis the “more likely than not” criteria is a lower threshold than the “probable” criteria 

notes 1 5 7 9 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “investment securities portfolio” on page 44 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

allowance for credit losses 

the acl includes the allowance for loan losses and the rulc the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio but which have not been specifically identified the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses as well as a qualitative review of the results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment and is described in more detail in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the rulc provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the allowance for loan losses plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses   as an example if the pd risk grade for all passgraded commercial and cre loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal risk grading scale the quantitatively determined amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2015 would increase by approximately 84 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in risk grades may have on the allowance estimation process 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the allowance for loan losses such factors include but are not limited to national and regional economic trends and indicators we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the allowance for loan losses for the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 50   contain further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the acl 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this annual test as of october 1 of each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit generally one of our banking segments compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired 

to determine the fair value we generally use a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies primarily banks and bank holding companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the company is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the company’s geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium of 25 was appropriate at the most recent test date 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount estimates include economic conditions which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the company ’ s regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective october 1 2015 upon completion of the evaluation process we concluded that none of our 

reporting units was impaired furthermore the evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 14 45 and 32 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100 bps the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 9 39 and 16 respectively additionally because of the decline in energy prices since october 1 2015 through december 31 2015 we ran additional sensitivity analyses to estimate the impact that the decline would have on amegy’s value and concluded that the goodwill of amegy was not considered impaired during 2015 

however due to the significant decline of energy prices in 2016 we are currently evaluating if the goodwill of amegy is considered impaired for the first quarter of 2016 our evaluation of impairment of goodwill balance at amegy will consider the following key assumptions the appropriate discount rate to reflect the uncertainty of achieving future cash flow projections growth rate of the texas economy net loan loss expectations for future periods stock prices of comparable publicly traded companies and oilgas forward price curves these assumptions have been impacted by the decline in energy prices in 2016 and prolonged decline in energy prices can adversely impact the carrying value of amegy note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains additional information related to goodwill 

income taxes 

we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

we had net dtas of 203 million at december 31 2015 compared to 224 million at december 31 2014 the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the allowance for loan losses 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities 3 pension and postretirement obligations and 4 deferred compensation arrangements no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2015 related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to 1 carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods 2 utilize the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences 3 implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible and 4 generate future taxable income 

after considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits we have tax reserves at december 31 2015 of approximately 4 million net of federal andor state benefits primarily relating to uncertain tax positions for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions

competition 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks credit unions and thrifts including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds insurance companies brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies and a variety of other types of companies many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered the quality of service delivered and pricing the company must compete effectively along all of these dimensions to remain successful 

supervision and regulation 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended among other things to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers including both loan customers and depositors and taxpayers these regulations are not however generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors and in fact may have the consequence of reducing returns to our shareholders this regulatory framework has been materially revised and expanded since the 20082009 financial crisis and recession in particular the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated pursuant to it have given financial regulators expanded powers over nearly every aspect of the company’s business these include among other things new higher regulatory capital requirements regulation of dividends and other forms of capital distributions to shareholders through annual stress testing and capital planning processes heightened liquidity and liquidity stress testing requirements which include specific definitions of the types of investment securities that qualify as “high quality liquid assets” and which effectively limit the portion of the company’s balance sheet that can be used to meet the credit needs of its customers specific limitations on mortgage lending products and practices specific limits on certain consumer payment fees and subjecting compensation practices to specific regulatory oversight and restrictions individually and collectively these additional regulations have imposed and will continue to impose higher costs on the company and have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders the doddfrank act provides for further regulations the specifics of which are still not known and the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined the company is committed 

to both satisfying heightened regulatory expectations and providing attractive shareholder returns however given the still changing regulatory environment the results of these efforts cannot yet be known 

described below are the material elements of some selected laws and regulations applicable to the company the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable laws or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the company 

the parent is a bank holding company and a financial holding company as provided by the bhc act as modified by the glb act and the doddfrank act these and other federal statutes provide the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the frb the supervision of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a bank holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator and the laws and regulations administered by those regulators the glb act allows our subsidiary banks to engage in certain financial activities through financial subsidiaries to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company or to do business through a financial subsidiary the parent and its subsidiary banks must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required 

the parent’s subsidiary banks and zions trust are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or other statutes governing national banks or for those that are statechartered banks the banking laws of their various states as well as the rules and regulations of the occ for those that are national banks and the fdic they are also subject to periodic examination and supervision by the occ or their respective state banking departments and the fdic many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other federal and state agencies these bank regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination role our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec finra andor state securities regulators 

the doddfrank act 

the recent financial crisis led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the united states 

the doddfrank act and regulations adopted under the doddfrank act broadly affect the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities requiring ongoing stress testing of our capital and liquidity mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring divestiture of certain equity investments increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector among other things affecting capital standards the doddfrank act provides that 

 regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act will require us to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets than was generally the case before the crisis and will limit the forms of capital that we will be able to rely upon for regulatory purposes for example provisions of the doddfrank act require us to transition trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital to tier 2 capital over a twoyear period that begins january 1 2015 in 2015 75 of trust preferred securities transition to tier 2 capital from tier 1 and the remaining 25 in 2016 in addition in its supervisory role with respect to our stress testing and capital planning our ability to deliver returns to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases is subject to prior nonobjection by the frb the stress 

testing and capital plan process also could substantially reduce our flexibility to respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and pricing of certain products and services including the following 

 the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining large financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the cfpb also enacted new regulations that became fully effective january 10 2014 which require significant changes to residential mortgage origination these changes include the definition of a “qualified mortgage” and the requirement regarding how a borrower’s “ability to repay” must be determined the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws which had enabled national banks and their subsidiaries to comply with federal regulatory requirements without complying with various state laws in addition the doddfrank act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

the doddfrank act contains numerous provisions that limit or place significant burdens and costs on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds for the affected activities these provisions may result in increased compliance and other costs increased legal risk and decreased scope of product offerings and earning assets 

the company is subject to the provisions of the volcker rule issued pursuant to the doddfrank act as of december 31 2014 the company had divested all securities that were not in compliance with the volcker rule and had sold all but 41 million  amortized cost of noncompliant investments such investments include 25 million of potential capital calls which the company expects to fund as allowed by the volcker rule if and as the capital calls are made until the investments are sold these investments are in private equity funds and are referred to in this document as private equity investments “peis” the company continues to pursue the disposition of all noncompliant peis the frb has granted a blanket extension of the volcker rule compliance date to july 21 2016 

the company and other companies subject to the doddfrank act are subject to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules these requirements generally implement the compensation restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act and include documentation and governance deferral risk balancing and clawback requirements 

as discussed further throughout this section many aspects of the doddfrank act are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company or the industry 

capital standards – basel framework 

the capital regulations issued by the frb and other u s regulators pursuant to the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the bcbs were still in effect as of december 31 2014 however in 2013 the frb fdic and occ issued final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the rules implement the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the 

basel iii capital rules substantially revise and restate basel 1 rules regarding the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company the basel iii capital rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components 

the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing riskweighting approach which was derived from basel i capital accords of the basel committee with a more risksensitive approach based in part on the standardized approach in the basel committee’s 2004 basel ii capital accords the basel iii capital rules also implement the requirements of section 939a of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules 

the basel iii capital rules among other things i introduce a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” ii specify that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements iii apply most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and iv expand the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratios as of january 1 2015 will be as follows 

 when fully phased in on january 1 2019 the basel iii capital rules will also require the company and its subsidiary banks to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

the basel iii capital rules also prescribe a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expand the riskweighting categories from the current four basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

the basel iii capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 the company’s preliminary analysis indicates that application of this part of the rule should not result in any deductions from cet1 also primarily as a result of the large amount of cdo sales completed in 2014 the company no longer expects the application of the basel iii corresponding deduction rules to have a material effect on its basel iii regulatory capital ratios either as phased in or on a fully phased in basis 

under current capital standards the effects of aoci items included in capital are excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios under the basel iii capital rules “nonadvanced approaches banking organizations” including the company and its subsidiary banks may make a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items the company has made the decision to “opt out” which will be reported to the frb on the company’s first quarter 2015 fry9 report 

the basel iii capital rules require that trust preferred securities be phased out from tier 1 capital by the end of 2015 however for a banking organization such as the company that has greater than 15 billion in total consolidated assets but is not an “advanced approaches banking organization” the basel iii capital rules permit permanent inclusion of trust preferred securities issued prior to may 19 2010 in tier 2 capital regardless of whether they would otherwise meet the qualifications for tier 2 capital as of december 31 2014 the company had outstanding 163 million of trust preferred securities that qualified for this permanent inclusion in tier 2 capital 

basel iii also requires additional disclosures to be made that are commonly referred to as “pillar 3” disclosures these disclosures require the company to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding its capital structure adequacy and riskweighted assets the disclosure requirements will be applicable beginning with the company’s financial results for the first quarter of 2015 the pillar 3 disclosures will be made publicly available on the company’s website 

the company believes that as of december 31 2014 the company and its subsidiary banks would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective 

stress testing prudential standards and early remediation 

as a bank holding company with assets greater than 50 billion the company is required by the doddfrank act to participate in annual stress tests known as the doddfrank annual stress test “dfast” and federal reserve’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” the company timely submitted its capital plan and stress test results to the frb on january 5 2015 in its capital plan the company was required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios for nine quarters ending the fourth quarter of 2016 its estimated regulatory capital ratios including its tier 1 common ratio under basel i rules its estimated regulatory capital ratios including its common equity tier 1 ratio under basel iii rules and its gaap tangible common equity ratio under the implementing regulations for ccar a bank holding company may generally only raise and redeem capital pay dividends and repurchase stock and take similar capitalrelated actions only under a capital plan as to which the frb has not objected 

on february 17 2014 the federal reserve published final rules to implement section 165 enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the board of governors and certain bank holding companies  of the doddfrank act the company believes that it is in compliance with these rules 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia an insured depository institution generally will be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its total riskbased capital is less than 8 or its tier 1 riskbased capital or leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment under the 

fully phasedin basel iii capital rules i a new cet1 ratio requirement will be introduced at every level other than critically undercapitalized with the required cet1 ratio being 65 for wellcapitalized status ii the minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category will be increased with the minimum tier 1 capital ratio for wellcapitalized status being 8 and iii the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3 leverage ratio and still be wellcapitalized will be eliminated at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan 

other regulations 

the company is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

 11 

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a comprehensive system of corporate governance practices this system includes policies and guidelines such as corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing some restrictions on the pledging of company stock by insiders and charters for the audit risk oversight compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 




 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee of the board approved an enterprise risk management policy and appointed an enterprise risk management committee consisting of senior management to oversee and implement the policy in addition to credit and interest rate risk these committees also monitor the following risk areas strategic risk market risk liquidity risk compliance risk compensationrelated risk operational risk information technology risk and reputation risk 

the following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the company including but not limited to 

credit quality has adversely affected us and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks if the strength of the us economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we and our subsidiary banks conduct operations declined this could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 

we have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio including loans secured by real estate and energyrelated lending which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results 

concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the company concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the company due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk 

most of our subsidiary banks engage in both commercial term and land acquisition development and construction lending primarily in our western states footprint and the company as a whole has relatively larger concentrations of such lending than many peer institutions in addition we have a concentration in energyrelated lending primarily in our amegy bank subsidiary both commercial real estate and energy lending are subject to specific risks including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateral values and activity levels in addition our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states and values there may behave differently than in other parts of the united states we may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue the management of interest rate risk for the company and its subsidiary banks is centralized and overseen by an asset liability management committee appointed by the company’s board of directors failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

the company remains in an “asset sensitive” interest rate risk position which means that net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates increase and to decline if interest rates decrease most recently the frb has indicated that it expects to be “patient” with respect to the timing and amount of any rate increases 

our estimates of our interest rate risk position for noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on assumptions for which there is little historical experience and the actual behavior of those deposits in a changing interest rate environment may differ materially from our estimates which could materially affect our results of operations 

we have experienced a low interest rate environment for the past several years our views with respect to among other things the degree to which we are “assetsensitive” including our interest rate risk position for noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on modeled projections that rely on assumptions regarding changes in balances of such deposits in a changing interest rate environment because there is no modern precedent for the prolonged extremely low interest rate environment that has prevailed for the last several years there is little historical experience upon which to base such assumptions if interest rates begin to increase our assumptions regarding changes in balances of noninterestbearing demand deposits and regarding the speed and degree to which other deposits are repriced may prove to be incorrect and business decisions made in reliance on our modeled projections and underlying assumptions could prove to be unsuccessful because noninterestbearing demand deposits are a significant portion of our deposit base errors in our modeled projections and the underlying assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

we have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

the united states and many other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession from which the recovery has been slow these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected the company’s assets including its loans and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition in response to the economic crisis the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis while these programs and policies may have had a stabilizing effect in the united states following the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of 2008 troubling economic conditions continue to exist in the united states and globally most of these programs have expired however the frb and central banks in other countries continue to pursue monetary policies that have resulted in an unusual period of very low interest rates however the full impact of these policies on among other things general economic activity and asset values that serve as collateral for loans extended by the company for example real estate values how long these policies may persist and the impacts of withdrawing those policies is unclear and may not be known for some time it is possible that economic conditions may again become more severe or that weak economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time economic and fiscal conditions in the united states and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic and market conditions faced by the company and its customers any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions including a recession or continued weak economic recovery would adversely affect the company 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

the company and its subsidiary banks must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by their banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios and the particular conditions risk profiles and growth plans of those entities compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require the company to raise additional capital or additional capital investment from the parent or its subsidiaries these uncertainties and risks including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties may increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the united states 

as a regional bank holding company the company provides a full range of banking and related services through its banking and other subsidiaries in arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico 

oregon texas utah washington and wyoming approximately 82 of the company’s total net interest income for the year ended december 31 2014 and 77 of total assets as of december 31 2014 relate to the subsidiary banks in utah texas and california as a result of this geographic concentration our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results for example our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events as of december 31 2014  loan balances at our subsidiary banks in utah texas and california comprised 82 of the company’s commercial lending portfolio 75 of the commercial real estate lending portfolio and 69 of the consumer lending portfolio loans originated by these banks are primarily to borrowers in their respective states with the exception of the national real estate group owneroccupied loan portfolio held by our utah subsidiary bank 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and the company 

the company has significant operations and a significant customer base in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy the company’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to the company’s property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the company’s customers and in turn on the company a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us certain of our affiliates and particular classes of securities that we and our affiliates issue the rates that we pay on our securities also are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we our affiliates andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies ratings downgrades to us our affiliates or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

the doddfrank act imposes significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank act has material implications for the company and the entire financial services industry the doddfrank act places significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions particularly those with more than 50 billion of assets including the company in addition among other things the doddfrank act 

 15 

 the company and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel systems consulting and other costs in order to comply with new regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act particularly with respect to stress testing and risk management because the responsible agencies are still in the process of proposing and finalizing many of the regulations required under the doddfrank act the full impact of this legislation on the company and the financial services industries business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for some time individually and collectively regulations adopted under the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the company’s and the financial services industry’s business financial condition including the company’s ability to compete effectively with less regulated financial services providers and results of operations 

as a regulated entity we are subject to capital and liquidity requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth 

we are a bank holding company and a financial holding company as such we and our subsidiary banks are subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the frb the occ in the case of our national subsidiary banks and the fdic including riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements and basel iii liquidity requirements capital needs may rise above normal levels when we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition risk profile and growth plans in addition we may be required to increase our capital levels even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts as a result of stress testing and capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios compliance with the capital requirements including leverage ratios may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels for a summary of recently announced capital rules see “capital standards – basel framework” in “supervision and regulation” on page 8 of mda in this form 10k 

stress testing and capital management under the doddfrank act may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

under the ccar we are required to submit to the federal reserve each year our capital plan for the applicable planning horizon along with the results of required stress tests each annual capital plan will among other things specify our planned actions with respect to dividends redemptions repurchases capital raising and similar matters and will be subject to the objection or nonobjection by the federal reserve moreover the ccar process requires us to analyze the pro forma impact on our financial condition of various hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios selected by us or the federal reserve we must maintain or raise capital sufficient to meet our risk management and regulatory expectations under such hypothetical scenarios similarly doddfrank act stress tests “dfast” are stress tests run by the federal reserve using its 

proprietary models to analyze the company’s stressed capital position in order to receive a “nonobjection” from the federal reserve to its capital plan it must pass both the federal reserve’s quantitatively modeled stress capital and a qualitative examination of its ccar submission and capital plan as required by the doddfrank act we also submit stress tests to the occ for amegy and zions and fdic for cbt for our subsidiary banks with assets in excess of 10 billion the severity of the hypothetical scenarios devised by the frb and other bank regulators and employed in these stress tests is undefined by law or regulation and is thus subject solely to the discretion of the regulators the stress testing and capital planning processes may among other things require us to increase our capital levels limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under stress testing and capital management standards implemented by bank regulatory agencies under the doddfrank act we may declare dividends repurchase common stock redeem preferred stock and debt access capital markets for certain types of capital make acquisitions and enter into similar transactions only if included in a capital plan to which the frb has not objected any similar transactions not contemplated in our annual capital plan other than those with a de minimus impact on actual or projected capital may require a new stress test and capital plan which is subject to frb nonobjection these requirements may significantly limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

we increasingly use models in the management of the company and in particular in the required stress testing and capital plan there is risk that these models are incorrect or inaccurate in various ways which can cause us to make nonoptimal decisions and this risk causes the company to hold additional capital as a buffer against that risk 

we attempt to carefully develop document back test and validate the models used in the management of the company including for example models used in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk and those used in projecting stress losses in various segments of our credit and securities portfolios and projecting net revenue under stress models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons however and cannot perfectly predict outcomes management decisions based in part on such models therefore can be suboptimal in addition in determining the company’s capital needs under stress testing we attempt to specifically quantify the amounts by which model results could be incorrect and we hold material additional amounts of capital as a buffer against this “model risk” 

new liquidity regulations including regulations establishing a minimum liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and requiring monthly liquidity stress testing applicable to the company may impact profitability 

the company is subject to new liquidity regulations including a requirement that it conduct monthly liquidity stress tests starting in january 2015 and that subject it to a new requirement that it maintain a modified lcr of at least 100 effective january 1 2016 current liquidity stress tests indicate that the company is in compliance with the modified lcr requirement such stress testing is subject to ongoing model and assumptions changes which could affect results 

in order to meet the requirements of these new regulations the company expects to hold a higher portion of its assets in high quality liquid assets “hqla” and a lower portion of its assets in loans than was generally the case prior to such regulation hqla generally have lower yields than loans of the type made by the company 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

increases in fdic insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings 

our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and accordingly we are subject to fdic insurance assessments   during 2008 and 2009 higher levels of bank failures dramatically increased resolution costs of the fdic and depleted the deposit insurance fund in addition the fdic instituted two temporary programs to further insure customer deposits at fdic insured banks these programs which have since expired placed additional stress on the deposit insurance fund in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund the fdic has increased assessment rates of insured institutions further under the doddfrank act the assessment base was expanded to include nondeposit liabilities we generally have only limited ability to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay the fdic for insurance changes in our required insurance premium payments may adversely impact our earnings 

other legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations 

in addition to the doddfrank act described previously bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation 

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted however if adopted some of these proposals could adversely affect the company by among other things impacting aftertax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting the company’s ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of the company’s funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that the company could offer and requiring the company to raise capital at inopportune times 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be adopted 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the company provides to its customers invests in and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the company to comply before their formal adoption identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements therefore pose an ongoing risk 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims fines litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings the company’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and increasingly aggressive enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations 

the quality and liquidity of our assetbacked investment securities portfolio has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

the company’s assetbacked investment securities portfolio includes cdos collateralized primarily by trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies many factors some of which are beyond the company’s control significantly influence the fair value and impairment status of these securities these factors include but are not limited to defaults deferrals and restructurings by debt issuers the views of banking regulators changes in our accounting treatment with respect to these securities rating agency downgrades of securities limited market pricing of securities or market pricing that varies from the company’s current model valuations and changes in prepayment rates and future interest rates the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in additional otti charges with respect to our cdo portfolio which could be material 

the company may not be able to utilize the significant deferred tax asset recorded on its balance sheet 

the company’s balance sheet includes a significant deferred tax asset the largest components of this asset result from additions to our allowance for loan and lease losses for purposes of generally accepted accounting principles in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes and otherthantemporary impairment losses on our securities portfolio that have not yet been realized for tax purposes by selling the securities our ability to continue to record this deferred tax asset is dependent on the company’s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital in addition inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations currently no deferred tax assets are disallowed for regulatory purposes either on a consolidated basis or at any of the company’s subsidiary banks 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations 

our information systems may experience an interruption or security breach 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems misappropriation of funds and theft of proprietary company or customer data while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

we are making a significant investment to replace our core loan and deposit systems and to upgrade our accounting systems the actual duration cost expected savings and other factors to implement these initiatives may vary significantly from our estimates which could materially affect the company including its results of operations 

during 2013 our board of directors approved a significant investment by us to replace our loan and deposit systems and to upgrade our accounting systems the new integrated system for most of our loans and deposits is expected to employ technology that is a significant improvement over our current systems these initiatives will be completed in phases to allow for appropriate testing and implementation so as to minimize time delays and cost overruns however these initiatives are in the early stages and by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings and related items are subject to change and significant variability 

we may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these initiatives these may include significant time delays cost overruns and other adverse developments that could result in disruptions to our systems and adversely impact our customers 

we have plans policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these adverse developments however there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately remediated the occurrence of any adverse development could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect the company including its results of operations in any given reporting period 

our results of operations depend upon the performance of our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our banking and other subsidiaries the parent receives substantially all of its revenues from dividends from its subsidiaries these dividends are a principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt we and certain of our subsidiaries experienced periods of unprofitability or reduced profitability during the recent severe recession the ability of the company and its subsidiary banks to pay dividends is restricted by regulatory requirements including profitability and the need to maintain required levels of capital lack of profitability or reduced profitability exposes us to the risk that regulators could restrict the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends it also increases the risk that the company may have to establish a “valuation allowance” against its net deferred tax asset or have that asset disallowed for regulatory capital purposes 

the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends or make other payments to us is also limited by their obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general regulatory restrictions on their dividends if they do not satisfy these regulatory requirements we may be unable to pay interest on our indebtedness the occ the primary regulator for certain of our subsidiary banks has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks only to pay dividends out of current earnings in addition if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which could include the payment of dividends such authority may take actions requiring that such bank refrain from the practice payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if a subsidiary bank were to become “undercapitalized” for purposes of the applicable federal regulatory “prompt corrective action” regulations

executive summary 

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 57 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is considered a “systemically important financial institution” under the doddfrank act 

 

longterm strategy 

we strive to maintain a local community and regional bank approach for customerfacing elements of our business we believe that our target customers appreciate the local focus and fast decisionmaking provided by our local management teams by retaining a significant degree of autonomy in product offerings and pricing we believe our banks have a meaningful competitive advantage over larger national banks whose loan and deposit products are often homogeneous however we centralize or oversee centrally many noncustomer facing operations such as risk and capital management and technology and back office operations currently the company is undertaking an extensive overhaul of its back office and accounting systems and is further evaluating ways to streamline its operations and improve its overall efficiency by centralizing many of these functions we believe we can generally achieve greater economies of scale and stronger risk management and that scale gives our portfolio of community banks superior access to capital markets more robust treasury management and other product capabilities than smaller independent community banks 

our strategy is driven by four key factors 

 the company continues to evaluate and alter its strategies as it attempts to mitigate adverse impacts on shareholder returns however given the stillchanging regulatory environment the results of these efforts cannot yet be known 

focus on geographies representing growth markets 

the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in growth markets primarily in the western part of the united states the states in our western geographic footprint have on average experienced higher rates of population and economic growth than the rest of the country our footprint is well diversified by industry and enjoys strong business formation rates real estate development and general economic expansion 

 

while some states in our footprint experienced a significant slowing in economic activity during the recent recession others experienced aboveaverage growth and stronger resistance to the economic downturn 

more than 77 of the company’s assets are held in the banks headquartered in utah texas and california zions bank has approximately 19 billion in assets which represent 33 of the company’s assets zions bank is the second largest fullservice commercial bank in the state of utah and the fourth largest in idaho as measured by domestic deposits and operates in all submarkets in utah and most submarkets in idaho the utah economy is primarily based on the energy agriculture real estate computer technology education health care and financial services sectors during 2014 utah employment grew at a rate of 39 compared to the national employment growth rate of 18 this growth improved utah’s overall unemployment rate to 35 in 2014 from 41 in 2013 in addition the utah state government has been recognized for its policies promoting a businessfriendly climate providing a predictable and stable tax policy and controlling government spending levels see “business segment results” on page 46 for further discussion on the 2014 performance of zions bank 

amegy located in texas has 14 billion in assets which represent approximately 24 of the company’s assets texas has a well diversified economy that is the second largest in the united states significant drivers of its growth are the energy health care manufacturing transportation and technology sectors in addition the texas economic environment benefits from businessfriendly growth policies and affordable housing markets these attributes and industry sectors have propelled the texas economy to outperform the nation which has resulted in the unemployment rate declining to 46 compared to the national rate of 56 amegy’s three primary markets houston dallas and san antonio experienced strong job growth in 2014 however due to the decline in energy commodity prices in late 2014 economic conditions are generally expected to slow compared to 2014 included within this document is an extensive discussion on the company’s energyrelated exposure as found on page 65 see “business segment results” on page 46 for further discussion on the 2014 performance of amegy 

cbt has approximately 11 billion in assets which represent 20 of the company’s assets trends in unemployment home foreclosures and bank credit problems continue to improve throughout california resulting in corresponding reductions in problem credits and nonperforming assets at cbt during 2014 california employment grew 21 which marked the state’s third straight year growing at least 2 this growth improved california’s overall unemployment rate to 70 in 2014 from 83 in 2013 california’s recovery however has been uneven with coastal areas experiencing much greater gains in employment and housing prices than the interior parts of the state cbt’s primary markets – the coastal and major metropolitan areas in california including the san francisco bay area los angeles county orange county and san diego – continued to experience economic improvements in 2014 compared to 2013 unemployment rates are much lower in cbt’s primary markets compared to the state as a whole see “business segment results” on page 46 for further discussion of the 2013 performance of cbt 

keep decisions that affect customers local 

we believe that over the long term ensuring that local management teams retain the authority over many of the decisions affecting their customers is a strategy that ultimately generates optimal growth and profitability in our banking businesses we operate eight different community and regional banks each under a different name and each with its own charter chief executive officer and management team we believe this approach allows us to attract and retain exceptional management and provides service of the highest quality to our targeted customers this structure helps ensure that many of the decisions related to customers are made at a local level 

 

the results of this service are evident in the outcome of the greenwich associates annual survey wherein the company consistently receives numerous “excellent” ratings from small and middlemarket businesses 

maintain a sustainable competitive advantage over community banks 

to create a sustainable competitive advantage over other smaller community banks we focus on achieving better product breadth and quality productivity economies of scale availability of liquidity and a lower cost of capital compared to community banks our objectives include the following 

 centralize and standardize policies and oversight of key risks 

we seek to standardize policies and practices related to the management of key risks in order to assure a consistent risk profile in an otherwise decentralized management model among these key risks and functions are credit interest rate liquidity and market risks 

 management’s overview of 2014 performance

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the company’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

the company measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements current accounting guidance has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the related life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the company’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available the company would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors cdos are valued using an internal model and the assumptions are analyzed for sensitivity “investment securities portfolio” on page 52   provides more information regarding this analysis 

investment securities are reviewed formally on a quarterly basis for the presence of otti the evaluation process takes into account current market conditions the fair value of the security relative to its amortized cost and many other factors the decision to deem these securities otti is based on a specific analysis of the structure of each security and an evaluation of the underlying collateral otti is considered to have occurred if its fair value is below amortized cost and 1 we intend to sell the security or 2 it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient 

to recover the entire amortized cost basis the “more likely than not” criteria is a lower threshold than the “probable” criteria 

notes 1 5 7 9 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio but which have not been specifically identified the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses as well as a qualitative review of the results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment and is described in more detail in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the allowance for loan losses plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses   as an example if the pd risk grade for all passgraded commercial and cre loans was immediately downgraded one grade on a 114 grade scale the quantitatively determined amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2014 would increase by approximately 77 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in risk grades may have on the allowance estimation process 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the allowance for loan losses such factors include but are not limited to national and regional economic trends and indicators we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the allowance for loan losses for the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 63   contain further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the allowance for credit losses 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this annual test as of october 1 of each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit generally one of our subsidiary banks compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired 

to determine the fair value we generally use a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies primarily banks and bank holding companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western 

and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the company is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the company’s geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium of 25 was appropriate at the most recent test date 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount estimates include economic conditions which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the company ’ s regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective october 1 2014 upon completion of the evaluation process we concluded that none of our subsidiary banks was impaired furthermore the evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 27 40 and 33 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100 bps the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 17 30 and 13 respectively additionally because of the significant decline in energy prices since october 1 2014 we ran additional sensitivity analyses to estimate the impact that the decline would have on amegy’s value even in the most severe of the additional sensitivity analyses related to the decline in energy prices the goodwill of amegy was not considered impaired note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains additional information related to goodwill 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where the company conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and 

estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

the company had net deferred tax assets “dtas” of 224 million at december 31 2014 compared to 304 million at december 31 2013 the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the allowance for loan losses 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities and 3 deferred compensation arrangements no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2014 related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to 1 carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods 2 utilize the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences 3 implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible and 4 generate future taxable income 

after considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits the company has tax reserves at december 31 2014 of approximately 2 million net of federal andor state benefits for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses recently issued accounting pronouncements that the company will be required to adopt also discussed is the company’s expectation of the impact these new accounting pronouncements will have to the extent they are material on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity   

results of operations 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of 3266 million or 168 per diluted common share for 2014 compared to 2940 million or 158 per diluted common share for 2013 the following changes had a favorable impact on net earnings applicable to common shareholders 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 34 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of 2940 million or 158 per diluted common share for 2013 compared to 1786 million or 097 per diluted common share for 2012 the following changes had a favorable impact on net earnings applicable to common shareholders 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest portion of the company’s revenue for 2014 taxableequivalent net interest income was 16961 million compared to 17118 million and 17502 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all years presented 

net interest margin in 2014 vs 2013 

the net interest margin was 326 and 336 for 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease resulted primarily from lower yields on loans and afs investment securities the impact of these items was partially offset by lower yields and balances on the company’s longterm debt 

even though the company’s average loan portfolio was 14 billion higher during 2014 compared to 2013 the average interest rate earned on those assets was 439 which is 38 bps lower than the comparable prior year rate this decline in interest income was primarily caused by 1 reduced interest income on loans acquired with fdic assistance in 2009 as those acquired portfolios were successfully managed down 2 adjustable rate loans originated in the past resetting to lower rates due to the current repricing index being lower than the rate when the loans were originated and 3 loans originated at lower rates than the weighted average rate of the existing portfolio the primary reasons for the narrowing of credit and interest rate spreads are a combination of competitive pricing pressures and improved customer credit which are the result of a more stable economic environment than a few years ago a portion of the narrowing of the spreads may be attributed to the improved fundamental condition of the company’s borrowers such as stronger earnings and improved leverage ratios 

the average htm securities portfolio was 609 million during 2014 compared to 762 million during the same prior year period during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company reclassified a substantial portion of its cdo securities from htm to afs as a result of the impact of the volcker rule the average yield earned during 2014 on htm securities was 36 bps higher than the yield in 2013 primarily due to the reclassification of cdo securities into the afs portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2013 that have a loweryield than the remaining securities in the htm portfolio 

the average balance of afs securities for 2014 increased by 365 million or 117 compared to 2013 and the average yield in 2014 was 15 bps lower than in 2013 the increase in afs securities was due primarily to purchases of approximately 10 billion par amount of agency passthrough securities the yield was also impacted by the sale of 913 million amortized cost of the company’s cdo securities during 2014 

average noninterestbearing demand deposits provided the company with low cost funding and comprised 424 

of average total deposits for 2014 compared to 397 for 2013 average interestbearing deposit balances were down 25 in 2014 compared to 2013 however the rate paid declined by 3 bps to 19 bps thus continuing the difficulty to reduce deposit costs further as these costs approach zero 

from december 31 2013 the company has reduced longterm debt by 12 billion as a result of tender offers early calls and redemptions at maturity including 835 million during the third quarter of 2014 these actions led to a decrease of 463 million or 203 of the company’s average longterm debt outstanding in 2014 compared to 2013 the average interest rate paid on longterm debt for 2014 decreased by 138 bps compared to 2013 refer to the “liquidity risk management” section beginning on page 81 for more information 

during 2014 most of the company’s cash in excess of that needed to fund earning assets was invested in money market assets primarily deposits with the federal reserve bank average money market investments were 158 of total interestearning assets compared to 173 in the prior year 

see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 76 for further discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and the associated risk 

net interest margin in 2013 vs 2012 

the net interest margin was 336 and 357 for 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease resulted primarily from 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following favorable developments 

 even though the company’s average loan portfolio excluding fdicsupported loans was 13 billion higher in 2013 than in 2012 the average interest rate earned on those assets was 42 bps lower this decline in interest income was driven by a reduction in fdicsupported loan income as that portfolio continues to wind down competitive pricing pressure and improvement in the underlying quality of our borrowers’ financial condition see discussion on asset quality on page 72 

the yield earned on afs securities during 2013 was 77 bps lower than in the prior year the yield decline primarily related to lower yields on assetbacked securities the fair values of these securities increased during 2013 but the coupon rates stayed the same resulting in lower yields also the interest rates for most of the securities in the afs securities portfolio are based on variable rate indexes such as the 3month libor rate which decreased between these years 

during 2013 most of the company’s excess liquidity was invested in money market assets primarily deposits with the federal reserve bank average money market investments increased to 173 of total interestearning assets in 2013 compared to 162 in the prior year the average rate earned on these investments remained essentially unchanged for these years 

noninterestbearing demand deposits provided the company with low cost funding and comprised 397 of average total deposits in 2013 compared to 384 in 2012 additionally the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits during 2013 decreased by 8 bps compared to 2012 

during 2013 the company refinanced a portion of its longterm debt by redeeming and repurchasing higher cost debt while issuing new lower cost debt this resulted in a 39 million increase in the average balance of longterm debt the average interest rate paid on longterm debt decreased by 191 bps due to these transactions as well as a reduction in the accelerated amortization of discount related to conversions of subordinated debt to preferred stock refer to the “liquidity management actions” section on page 83 for more information

chart 4   net interest margin 

see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 76 for further discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and the associated risk 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 299 302 and 316 for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2014 was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the net interest margin 

we expect the mix of interestearning assets to change over the next several quarters due to further decreases in the fdicsupportedpci loan portfolio and slighttomoderate loan growth in the commercial and industrial and residential mortgage portfolios accompanied by somewhat less growth in commercial real estate loans in addition as discussed below we are incrementally investing in shorttomedium duration agency passthrough securities that qualify as hqla over time we expect these investments to reduce the proportion of earning assets in cash and money market instruments and increase the proportion of afs securities average yields on the loan portfolio are likely to continue to experience modest downward pressure due to competitive pricing lower benchmark indices such as libor and growth in loweryielding residential mortgages however we expect this pressure to be somewhat less likely than in the prior two years we believe that some of the downward pressure on the net interest margin will be mitigated by lower interest expense on reduced levels of longterm debt that resulted from the company’s tender offers early calls and maturities during 2014 additional reductions to longterm debt will occur due to maturities in 2015 we also believe we can offset some of the pressure on the net interest margin through loan growth 

the company expects to remain “assetsensitive” which refers to net interest income increasing as a result of a rising interest rate environment with regard to interest rate risk in response to new liquidity and liquidity stresstesting regulations which elevate relative to historic levels the proportion of high quality liquid assets that the company will be required to hold on its balance sheet we decided in the second half of 2014 to begin deploying cash into shorttomedium duration agency passthrough securities in 2014 the company increased its hqla securities by approximately 10 billion par amount and is continuing these purchases in 2015 over time these purchases are expected to somewhat reduce our asset sensitivity compared to previous periods our estimates of the company’s actual interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes in addition our modeled projections for noninterestbearing demand deposits a substantial portion of our deposit balances are particularly reliant on assumptions for which there is little historical experience due to the prolonged period of very low interest rates further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate risk” on page 77 

the following schedule summarizes the average balances the amount of interest earned or incurred and the applicable yields for interestearning assets and the costs of interestbearing liabilities that generate taxableequivalent net interest income

in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate changes due to the volumerate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate both increase the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate when the rate increases and volume decreases the variance is allocated to rate 

provisions for credit losses 

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various loan portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs credit trends and external factors see note 6   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 63 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

during the past few years the company has experienced a significant improvement in credit quality metrics including lower levels of criticized and classified loans and lower realized loss rates in most loan segments for example at december 31 2014 classified loans were 11 billion compared to 13 billion and 19 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively net loan and lease chargeoffs declined to 42 million in 2014 from 52 million and 155 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively the 2014 ratio of net loan and lease chargeoffs to average loans was 011   see “nonperforming assets” on page 72 and “allowance and reserve for credit losses” on page 75 for further details 

these sustained significant improvements in portfoliospecific credit quality metrics sustained improvement in broader economic and credit quality indicators and changes in the portfolio mix resulting from the reductions in outstanding balances of construction and land development loans combined with relatively modest growth in loans and commitments have resulted in negative provisions for loan and lease losses and a reduction in the alll the provision for loan losses for 2014 was 981 million compared to 871 million and 142 million for 2013 and 2012 respectively 

however as the company’s credit quality metrics have improved to relatively strong levels the scope for further improvement is believed to be limited in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company decided to increase the portion of the reserve related to qualitative and environmental factors due to recent sharp declines in energy prices causing anticipated credit losses to increase across the company’s energy portfolio the company continues to exercise caution with regard to the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses given the slow economic recovery and the decline in oil and gas prices as a result we currently do not expect further significant reductions in the alll in 2015 and we currently expect net positive provisions for the year 

during 2014 the company recorded an 86 million provision for unfunded lending commitments compared to 171 million in 2013 and 44 million in 2012 the negative provision in 2014 was primarily driven by the same factors that caused the negative provision for loan losses described previously the overall decrease in the provision from 2012 to 2013 resulted primarily from refinements in the process of estimating the rate at which such commitments are likely to convert into funded balances and from continued improvements in credit quality the decrease was partially offset by an increase in unfunded lending commitments from quarter to quarter the expense related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations and funding as well as changes in credit quality 

a significant contributor to net earnings in both 2013 and 2014 was the negative provision for loan and lease losses this is primarily attributable to continued reduction in both the quantity of problem loans and the loss severity of such problem loans although we currently expect further improvements in credit quality we do not expect this to be a significant source of earnings deterioration in economic conditions within our footprint would likely result in net additions to the allowance such as the recent decline in oil and gas prices at amegy in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a significant change in profitability 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues the company earns for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield for 2014 noninterest income was 5086 million compared to 3374 million in 2013 and 4199 million in 2012 

schedule 4 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years

noninterest income 



other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of atm fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit and credit card interchange fees cash management fees lending commitment fees syndication and servicing fees and other miscellaneous fees increased by 10 million in 2014 compared to 2013 most of the increase can be attributed to higher interchange fees which increased by approximately 13 million in 2014 primarily due to increased numbers of commercial card customers and increased usage of those cards this was offset by a decrease of approximately 3 million in exchange and other fees 

in 2013 other service charges commissions and fees increased by 71 million compared to 2012 most of the increase can be attributed to higher bankcard merchant and interchange fees in 2013 other service charges commissions and fees included approximately 344 million of debit card interchange fees compared to approximately 325 million in 2012 

loan sales and servicing income decreased by 93 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease is mainly caused by decreased income from residential mortgage loan sales in 2014 compared to 2013 in 2014 the company and the industry experienced a reduction in the volume of new residential loan originations primarily for refinanced mortgages in response the company decided to retain more newlyoriginated loans on its balance sheet rather than sell them in order to fund them using some of its excess balance sheet liquidity to improve net interest income in 2013 the company also had lower loan sales than in 2012 as the company originated fewer residential mortgages and retained more mortgage loans in its portfolio than in 2012 

capital markets and foreign exchange income includes trading income public finance fees foreign exchange income and other capital market related fees in 2014 capital markets and foreign exchange income decreased by 57 million due primarily to a 18 million decrease in trading income and a 17 million decrease in bond origination fees from clients due to lower levels of financing activity capital markets and foreign exchange income remained fairly stable in 2013 when compared to 2012 

fair value and nonhedge derivative loss consists of the following 

schedule 5 

fair value and nonhedge derivative loss 



fair value and nonhedge derivative loss improved by 68 million in 2014 primarily as a result of the termination of the total return swap effective april 28 2014 partially offset by losses on derivative fair value credit adjustments fair value and nonhedge derivative loss was 36 million lower in 2013 than in 2012 the decreased losses are primarily attributable to changes in fair value on interest rate swaps 

during 2014 the company recorded 135 million of equity securities gains compared to 85 million in 2013 and 113 million in 2012 the increase was driven by unrealized gains related to appreciation of the company’s sbic equity investments including a particular investment that had a significant writeup in the fourth quarter most of the gains recognized in 2013 were generated by sbic investments private equity funds and the sale of other investments including sales of some investments that did not comply with the volcker rule we expect that the resulting decline in the overall size of our equity investments portfolio may limit future earnings from this source 

the fixed income securities gain of 104 million in 2014 was primarily from paydowns and payoffs of the cdo securities the net loss recorded in 2013 was primarily due to cdo sales 

the company recognized only 27 thousand of net impairment losses on investment securities compared to 1651 million in 2013 and 1041 million in 2012 see “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 for additional information these impairment losses occurred in our portfolio of trust preferred cdo securities approximately 10 billion of these securities were sold or paid down in 2014 leaving a portfolio of 592 million of amortized cost as of december 31 2014 

in 2013 other noninterest income increased by 48 million from 2012 the increase was primarily due to gains related to certain loans which had been purchased from failed banks covered by fdic losssharing agreements as well as gains from branch deposit and asset sales other noninterest income decreased by 100 million in 2014 primarily as a result of a decline in the same items that led to the increase in 2013 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense decreased by 29 to 16653 million in 2014 compared to 2013 during both 2013 and 2014 the company redeemed considerable amounts of its longterm debt and incurred debt extinguishment costs however these costs were not as large in 2014 as they were in 2013 other noninterest expense also decreased by approximately 193 million in 2014 primarily as a result of reductions in writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset these decreases in expense were partially offset by a 48 increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2014 

schedule 6 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

schedule 6 

noninterest expense 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 48 in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by a higher amount of salaries and bonuses the increase in base salaries resulted in part from increased headcount related to the company’s major systems projects and buildout of its enterprise risk management and stress testing functions partially offset by reductions elsewhere staff involved in those projects tend to be in more highly compensated roles than positions in which reductions occurred at june 30 2014 the company’s headcount had increased to 10536 fulltime equivalent “fte” employees from 10452 at december 31 2013 during the third quarter of 2014 the company incurred severance costs of approximately 5 million and reduced fte employees to 10462 as of december 31 2014 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 31 during 2013 most of the increase can be attributed to higher base salaries and bonuses which were partially offset by decreased sharebased compensation and lower retirement expense 

salaries and employee benefits are shown in greater detail in schedule 7 

schedule 7 

salaries and employee benefits 



furniture equipment and software expense increased by 87 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase was due to an increase in the company’s maintenance agreements added licenses and contract renewals for a variety of vendors 

other real estate expense went from an expense of 17 million in 2013 to an income amount of 13 million in 2014 the improvement in this expense is due to the company having less holding costs associated with these properties and recognizing gains from sales other real estate expense decreased 914 in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease is primarily due to lower writedowns of oreo values during workout and lower holding expenses partially offset by decreased gains from property sales oreo balances declined by 590 during the last 12 months 

creditrelated expense includes costs incurred during the foreclosure process prior to the company obtaining title to collateral and recording an asset in oreo as well as other outofpocket costs related to the management of problem loans and other assets during 2014 creditrelated expense decreased by 56 million primarily due to lower legal expenses appraisal expenses and property taxes additionally the levels of problem credits have decreased from 2013 the decrease in creditrelated expense in 2013 is primarily attributable to lower foreclosure costs and legal expenses 

fdic premiums decreased in 2014 by 58 million or 153 from 2013 in 2013 fdic premiums decreased by 124 most of the decrease in 2014 was due to reduced assessment rates resulting from improved credit quality of the company’s loan portfolio and improved capital adequacy the company does not expect the fdic premiums to significantly change in 2015 

in both 2013 and 2014 the company reduced longterm debt through tender offers early calls and maturities the tender offers in 2014 resulted in debt extinguishment cost of 444 million which is a decrease of 758 million from 2013 in 2013 the company incurred 1202 million of debt extinguishment cost due the extinguishment of several longterm debt instruments no such costs were incurred in 2012 for more information see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other noninterest expense decreased by 193 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the decline is primarily the result of decreased writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset in 2013 the company experienced an increase in writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset compared to the prior year the balance of fdicsupported loans declined significantly in 2014 primarily due to paydowns and payoffs the company does not expect significant writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset in 2015 

income taxes 

the company’s income tax expense was 2229 million in 2014 1429 million in 2013 and 1934 million in 2012 the company’s effective income tax rates including the effects of noncontrolling interests were 359 in 2014 351 in 2013 and 356 in 2012 the tax expense rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance in 2012 these rate reductions were mostly offset by the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock further the rate reductions in 2014 were offset by the reduction in the amount of tax credits generated and the inclusion of approximately 3 million of taxrelated interest expense in income tax expense on the financial statements the interest paid related to various notices and to the closure of various federal and state audits 

as discussed in previous filings the company has received federal income tax credits under the us government’s community development financial institutions fund that are recognized over a sevenyear period from the year of investment the effect of these tax credits provided an income tax benefit of 06 million in 2013 and 12 million in 2012 

the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of approximately 224 million at december 31 2014 compared to 304 million at december 31 2013 the decrease in the net deferred tax asset resulted primarily from items 

related to loan chargeoffs in excess of loan loss provisions fair value adjustments on security sales and oreo the net decrease in deferred tax assets was partially offset by a decrease in the deferred tax liabilities related to premises and equipment and the debt exchange from 2009 

the company did not record any additional valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2014 see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 30 for additional information 

preferred stock dividends and redemption 

in 2014 the company incurred preferred stock dividends of 719 million a decrease of 236 million from 2013 additionally the benefit from preferred stock redemptions decreased by 1257 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in the dividends and redemption benefit is due to the redemption of preferred stock in 2013 during the third quarter of 2013 the company redeemed all of its outstanding 800 million par amount 799467 shares of 95 series c preferred stock at 100 of the 25 per depositary share redemption amount the redemption reduced preferred stock by the 926 million carrying value at the time of redemption of the series c preferred stock the difference from the par amount or 1257 million related to the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the convertible subordinated debt the redemption of the series c preferred stock had a positive 068 per share impact on the company’s earnings per share in the third quarter of 2013 the company did not have any preferred stock redemptions in 2014

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases 

schedule 2  which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of the company’s interest earning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another goal is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets such as money market investments or securities while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets the current period of slow economic growth accompanied by the moderate loan demand experienced in recent quarters has made it difficult to achieve these goals   in 2014 the company began to incrementally deploy some of its excess cash into shorttomedium duration passthrough agency securities that qualify as hqla under new lcr and liquidity stress testing regulations as a result of this the company increased its hqla securities by approximately 10 billion par amount and is continuing these purchases in 2015 which will generate a higher return than that of money market investments 

average interestearning assets were 520 billion in 2014 compared to 510 billion in the previous year average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 931 in 2014 and 928 in 2013 

average loans were 395 billion in 2014 and 381 billion in 2013 average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 707 in 2014 compared to 694 in 2013 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold and security resell agreements decreased by 72 to 82 billion in 2014 compared to 88 billion in 2013 average securities increased by 62 from 2013 average total deposits increased by 21 while average total loans increased by 37 in 2014 when compared to 2013 the decrease in average money market investments in 2014 was due in part to excess cash being deployed to fund the loan growth that was stronger than deposit growth in addition to security purchases and redemptions of longterm debt

we invest in securities to generate revenues for the company portions of the portfolio are also available as a source of liquidity refer to the “liquidity risk management” section on page 81 of the mda for additional information on management of liquidity and funding management and compliance with basel iii and lcr requirements schedule 9 presents a profile of the company’s investment securities portfolio the amortized cost amounts represent the company’s original cost of the investments adjusted for related accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments and for impairment losses including creditrelated impairment the estimated fair value measurement levels and methodology are discussed in detail in note 20   of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedule 9 

investment securities portfolio 

the amortized cost of investment securities on december 31 2014 increased by 14 from the balances on december 31 2013 primarily due to increases in agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities small business administration loanbacked securities and municipal securities partially offset by decreased investments in trust preferred and other assetbacked securities and mutual funds in 2013 the amortized cost of investment securities also increased by 14 primarily due to increases in agency securities small business administration loanbacked securities and mutual funds partially offset by decreased investments in trust preferred and other assetbacked securities us treasury securities and agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities 

the cdo securities sold during 2014 consisted of the following 

schedule 10 

cdo securities sold in 2014 



1 defined as either deferring current interest “piking” or otti 

during 2014 the company realized 5 million of losses on sales of cdo securities the losses represent the difference between the amortized cost and the sales proceeds at the time of sale depending upon the sales price previously unrealized holding gainslosses recognized in oci may be reclassified to earnings or act to reduce remaining unrealized gainslosses in the portfolio sales and payoffs eliminated the company’s holdings of cdos comprised of solely insurance companies during 2014 at december 31 2014 the cdo portfolio consisted of cdos backed primarily by bank collateral 

as of december 31 2014 27 of the 38 billion fair value of availableforsale “afs” securities portfolio was valued at level 1 868 was valued at level 2 and 105 was valued at level 3 under the gaap fair value accounting valuation hierarchy at december 31 2013 70 of the 37 billion fair value of afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 577 was valued at level 2 and 353 was valued at level 3 

the amortized cost of afs investment securities valued at level 3 was 522 million at december 31 2014 and the fair value of these securities was 402 million the securities valued at level 3 were comprised of primarily bank trust preferred cdos and municipal securities for these level 3 securities the net pretax unrealized loss recognized in oci at december 31 2014 was 120 million as of december 31 2014 we believe we will receive on settlement or maturity at least the amortized cost   amounts of the level 3 afs securities this expectation applies to both those securities for which otti has been recognized and those for which no otti has been recognized 

estimated fair value determined under asc 820 precludes the use of “blockage factors” or liquidity adjustments due to the quantity of securities held by the company all of the company’s cdo securities are valued under level 3 the company’s ability to sell in a short period of time a substantial portion of its cdo securities at the indicated estimated fair values is highly dependent upon then current market conditions the market for such securities which showed substantial improvement during 2014 remains difficult to predict the company may execute additional cdo sales in future quarters which may result in net losses please refer to notes 5 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

schedule 11 presents the company’s cdos according to performing tranches without credit impairment and nonperforming tranches these cdos are the large majority of our assetbacked securities and consist of both htm and afs securities

we have included selected credit rating information for certain of the investment securities in schedules 12 and 13 because this information is one indication of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed and significant declines in ratings for our investment portfolio could indicate an increased level of risk for the company 

as shown in schedule 12 cdo securities representing 922 of that portfolio’s fair value at december 31 2014 were upgraded by one or more nrsros during 2014 the company attributes these upgrades to improvements in overcollateralization ratios and deleveraging combined with certain less severe rating agency assumptions and methodologies

bank collateral deferral experience 

the company’s loss and recovery experience on defaults as of december 31 2014 and our level 3 modeling assumption is essentially a 100 loss on defaulted bank collateral in cdos although we have to date received several generally small recoveries on a few defaults securities sales during 2014 resulted in the company reducing its exposure to some unresolved deferring banks at december 31 2014 the company had exposure to 43 deferring issuers of which 32 were in their initial fiveyear deferral period we continue to expect that future losses on these deferrals may result from actions other than bank failures – primarily holding company bankruptcies and debt restructurings 

a significant number of previous deferrals have resumed interest payments 157 issuing banks have either come current and resumed interest payments on their trust preferred securities or have announced they intend to do so at the next payment date banks may come current on their trust preferred securities for one or more quarters and then redefer such redeferral has occurred in 11 of the 43 banks that are currently deferring further information on the company’s valuation process is detailed in note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedule 13 provides additional information on the belowinvestmentgrade rated bank trust preferred cdos’ portions of the afs and htm portfolios the schedules reflect data and assumptions that are included in the calculations of fair value and otti the schedules utilize the lowest rating assigned by any rating agency to identify those securities below investment grade the schedules segment the securities by whether or not they have been determined to have creditrelated otti and by original ratings level to provide granularity on the seniority level of the securities and the distribution of unrealized losses

significant assumption changes for 2014 

the company reduced discount rates and prepayment assumptions on cdo securities during 2014 neither assumption change was material to either fair value estimates or credit impairment considerations during 2014 the company incorporated these observations into the process used to estimate fair value trade information included sales of cdo securities by the company and by third parties 

after observing slower prepayment rates in the latter half of 2014 we reduced our prepayment rate assumption effective at yearend 2014 we assumed all cdo collateral would prepay at a 2 annual prepayment rate through maturity this differed from our third quarter prepayment rate assumption which assumed that small banks would prepay at a 3 annual prepayment rate through maturity and that larger investment graderated issuing banks facing the phasedin disallowance of certain trust preferred securities as tier 1 capital would fully prepay by yearend 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2014 we observed no prepayments of big bank collateral remaining within our pools decreased prepayment rates are generally adverse to the fair value of the most senior tranches and favorable to the fair value of the more junior tranches 

valuation sensitivity of level 3 bank cdos 

schedule 14 sets forth the sensitivity of the current internally modeled cdos ’  fair values to changes in the most significant assumptions utilized in the model 

schedule 14 

sensitivity of internal model 



1 the company uses an incurred credit loss model which specifies cumulative losses at the 1year 5year and 30year points from the date of valuation these current and projected losses are reflected in the cdo’s fair value 

 3 the discount rate is a spread over the forward libor curve at the date of valuation 

4 percentage increase is applied to incremental projected loss percentages from currently performing collateral for example the 50 and 100 stress scenarios for afs securities would result in cumulative 30year losses of 448  38650 0218104 and 510  386100 0218104 respectively 

5 prepayment rate increased to 3 per year through maturity 

 during 2014 the market level discount rates applicable to bank cdos declined substantially and fair values rose the discount rate or credit spread in the above 2014 sensitivity analysis of valuation assumptions is approximately 166 bps lower than that used in 2013 trade data supported the extent of fair value increases through the year in addition the afs portfolio’s fair value exhibited much less sensitivity to loss assumptions on performing collateral than was the case in 2013 this is due to the company’s sales of the junior priority afs securities during 2014 

schedule 15 presents the maturities of the different types of investments that the company owned and the corresponding average yield as of december 31 2014 based on amortized cost expected maturities rather than contractual maturities are shown for trust preferred cdos sba securities agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities and certain agency and municipal securities see “liquidity risk management” on page 81 and notes 1 5 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s investment securities and their management

otherthantemporary impairment – investments in debt securities 

we review investments in debt securities each quarter for the presence of otti for securities for which an internal incomebased cash flow model or third party valuation service produces a lossadjusted expected cash flow for the security the presence of otti is identified and the amount of the credit component of otti is calculated by discounting this lossadjusted cash flow at the securityspecific effective interest rate and comparing that value to the company’s amortized cost of the security 

we review the relevant facts and circumstances each quarter to assess our intentions regarding any potential sales of securities as well as the likelihood that we would be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost for afs securities and prior to maturity for htm securities at december 31 2014 for each afs security whose fair value was below amortized cost we have determined that we did not intend to sell the security and that it was not more likely than not we would be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis   for each htm security whose fair value was below amortized cost we have determined that it was not more likely than not we would be required to sell the security before maturity 

during 2014 the company recognized an immaterial amount of otti on cdos compared to 1651 million in 2013 for some cdo tranches that we do not intend to sell which have previously recorded otti the expected future cash flows have remained stable or have slightly improved subsequent to the quarter that otti was identified and recorded for other cdo tranches an adverse change in the expected future cash flows has resulted in the 

recording of additional otti in both situations while a difference may remain between fair value and amortized cost the difference is not due to credit and the expected future cash flows substantiate the return of the full amortized cost of the cdo tranches we utilize a present value technique to both identify the otti existing in the cdo tranches and to estimate fair value the primary drivers of unrealized losses in these cdos are further discussed in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in 2013 as a result of the volcker rule ifr and the company’s decision to reduce its risk profile the company changed its intent with respect to the holding period of certain afs securities including some securities that were formerly htm the result was a pretax securities impairment charge of 137 million on these securities approximately one third of the charge relates to securities that the company determined to sell during the first quarter of 2014 and which the volcker rule and the ifr at the time the decision was made precluded the company from holding beyond july 21 2015 by which time the company did not expect to have recovered its amortized cost that deadline has since been extended to july 21 2016 and the federal reserve has announced its intention to grant an additional oneyear extension to july 21 2017 the remaining two thirds of the charge relates to securities that the company determined to sell during the first quarter of 2014 despite each being allowable under the volcker rule and the ifr 

additionally creditrelated impairment of 5 million was identified in the fourth quarter of 2013 in securities that we did not intend to sell we evaluate the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of each security and identify if any of the difference is due to credit the credit component of the difference is recognized by writing down the amortized cost of each security found to have otti

foreign deposits at december 31 2014 and 2013 were 03 billion and 20 billion respectively the decrease is due to the closing of the zions bank branch foreign deposits are related to domestic customers of our subsidiary banks 

loans held for sale 

loans held for sale consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market were 133 million at december 31 2014 compared to 171 million at december 31 2013 consumer loans are primarily fixed rate mortgages that are originated and sold to third parties 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2014 net loans and leases accounted for 700 of total assets compared to 697 at the end of 2013 schedule 17 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2014 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in a small number of cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 77 

schedule 17   

loan portfolio by type and maturity 

as of december 31 2014 net loans and leases were 401 billion reflecting a 26 increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations as well as a decrease in paydowns and chargeoffs of existing loans 

most of the loan portfolio growth during 2014 occurred in   commercial and industrial 14 family residential and home equity credit line loans the impact of these increases was partially offset by declines in commercial owner occupied and commercial real estate construction loans the loan portfolio increased primarily at amegy nsb and vectra while balances declined at cbt and zions bank 

of the significant increases and decreases within the portfolio commercial and industrial loans increased more than 700 million due in part to an increase in loan production and 14 family residential loans increased more than 450 million primarily due to the purchase of 249 million par amount of high quality jumbo arm loans from another bank 

commercial owner occupied loans declined more than 200 million due to the runoff and attrition of the national real estate portfolio at zions bank which is expected to continue in 2015 the national real estate business is a wholesale business that depends upon loan referrals from other community banking institutions due to generally soft loan demand nationally many community banking institutions are retaining rather than selling their loan production 

we expect overall loan and lease growth to increase at a moderate pace in 2015 we also expect to continue to limit construction and land development loan commitment growth for the foreseeable future as part of management’s actions to improve the risk profile of the company’s loans and to reduce portfolio concentration risk 

loans serviced for the benefit of others remained unchanged at 27 billion during 2014 and 2013 

since 2009 cbt and nsb have had loss sharing agreements with the fdic that provided indemnification for credit losses of acquired loans and foreclosed assets up to specified thresholds the agreements for commercial loans which comprised the major portion of the acquired portfolio expired as of september 30 2014 the agreements for 14 family residential loans will expire in 2019 in previous periods the fdicsupported loan balances were presented separately in schedules within mda and in other disclosures and included pci loans as discussed in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements due to declining balances for all years presented herein the fdicsupportedpci loans have been reclassified to their respective loan segments and classes

deposits 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company average total deposits increased by 21 during 2014 with average interestbearing deposits decreasing by 25 and average noninterestbearing deposits increasing 91 the average interest rate paid for interestbearing deposits was 3 bps lower in 2014 than in 2013 

core deposits at december 31 2014 which exclude time deposits larger than 100000 and brokered deposits increased by 34 or 15 billion from december 31 2013 the increase was mainly due to increases in noninterestbearing and interestbearing demand deposits savings accounts and a marginal increase in money market accounts partially offset by foreign deposits and time deposits the increases in noninterestbearing demand deposits resulted primarily from increased balances in accounts of existing customers 

demand and savings and money market deposits comprised 943 of total deposits at december 31 2014 compared with 901 at december 31 2013 

during 2014 and 2013 the company maintained a relatively low level of brokered deposits with the primary purpose of keeping that funding source available in case of a future need at december 31 2014 total deposits included 108 million of brokered deposits compared to 29 million at december 31 2013

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit administration and credit examination functions at the parent we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local affiliate level in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to management and to the risk oversight committee of the board of directors new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the corporate new product review committee 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each subsidiary bank can be more conservative in its operations under the corporate credit policy however formal corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to invoke a more liberal policy historically there have been only a limited number of such approvals this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

the company’s credit risk management strategy includes diversification of its loan portfolio the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty generally the company is well diversified in its loan portfolio however due to the nature of the company’s geographical footprint there are certain significant concentrations primarily in cre and energyrelated lending the company has adopted and adheres to concentration limits on various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending leveraged lending municipal lending and energyrelated lending all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary these concentration limits particularly with regard to the various types of cre and real estate development are materially lower than they were in 2007 and 2008 just prior to the emergence of the recent economic downturn during 2014 the company determined to further reduce construction and land development loan commitments this was done largely as a result of the modeled losses by the company and management’s beliefs about the likely severity of losses modeled by the federal reserve in its stress testing under the severely adverse economic scenarios as required under the doddfrank act the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers located within the geographical footprint of its subsidiary banks 

the credit quality of the company’s loan portfolio improved during 2014 nonperforming lendingrelated assets at december 31 2014 decreased by approximately 28 from december 31 2013 gross chargeoffs for 2014 declined to 106 million from 131 million in 2013 net chargeoffs decreased to 42 million from 52 million for the same periods 

as displayed in schedule 19 commercial and industrial loans were the largest category and constituted 329 of the company’s loan portfolio at december 31 2014 construction and land development loans slightly decreased to 50 of total loans at december 31 2014 compared to 56 at december 31 2013 however they have declined significantly from a prerecession level of 201 of total loans at the end of 2007

energyrelated exposure 

various industries represented in the previous schedule including mining quarrying and oilgas extraction manufacturing and transportation and warehousing contain certain loans categorized by the company as energyrelated at december 31 2014 the company had approximately 63 billion of total credit energyrelated exposure and 32 billion of primarily oil and gas energyrelated loan balances the distribution of energyrelated loans by customer market segment is shown in schedule 22 

schedule 22 

energyrelated exposure 1   



 65 

as of december 31 2014 17 million or 05 of the 32 billion outstanding oil and gas energyrelated loan balances were nonperforming the company’s historical energy lending performance has been strong despite significant volatility in both oil and natural gas prices largely due to the efforts of our highly experienced team of bankers dedicated exclusively to the energy finance sector conservative underwriting standards and solid risk management controls and practices losses following the 20082009 period of oil and gas price declines and volatility were modest energyrelated classified loans increased significantly during this last economic downturn nonperforming loans increased much more modestly and annual losses were relatively minor approximately 1 in the peak year of 2010 the company’s cumulative energyrelated net chargeoffs over the last five years have been lower than the cumulative net loss rate of general commercial and industrial lending during that same time period 

upstream 

upstream exploration and production loans comprised approximately 32 of the company’s energyrelated exposure as of december 31 2014 most upstream borrowers have relatively balanced production between oil and gas 

the company uses disciplined underwriting practices to mitigate the risk associated with its upstream lending activities upstream loans are made to reservebased borrowers where more than 90 of those loans are collateralized by the value of the borrower’s oil and gas reserves the company’s oil and gas price deck the pricing applied to a borrowers reserves for underwriting purposes has generally been below the nymex strip ie the average of the daily settlement prices of the next 12 months’ futures contracts through the use of independent company and thirdparty engineers and conservative underwriting the company applies multiple discounts these discounts often range from 1040 of the value of the collateral in determining the borrowing base commitment and help protect credit quality against significant commodity price declines further reservebased commitments are subject to a borrowing base redetermination based on thencurrent energy prices typically every six months generally the company has at its option the right to conduct additional redeterminations during the year borrowing bases for clients are usually set at 6070 of available collateral after an adjustment for the discounts described above 

upstream borrowers generally do not draw the maximum available funding on their lines which provides the borrower additional liquidity and flexibility the line utilization rate on reservebased loan commitments was approximately 57 at december 31 2014 this unused commitment gives us the ability in some cases to reduce the borrowing base commitment through the redetermination process without creating a borrowing base deficiency where outstanding debt exceeds the new borrowing base nevertheless our loan agreements generally require the borrowers to maintain a certain amount of equity therefore if the loan to collateral value exceeds an acceptable limit we work with the borrowers to reinstate an acceptable collateralvalue threshold 

an additional metric that the company considers in its underwriting is a borrower’s oil and gas price hedging practices a significant portion of the company’s reservebased borrowers are hedged of the company’s riskbased estimated oil production projected in 2015 and 2016 more than 50 is hedged based on weighted average commitments and the latest data provided by the borrowers 

midstream 

midstream marketing and transportation loans comprised approximately 19 of the company’s energyrelated exposure as of december 31 2014 loans in this segment are made to companies that gather transport treat and blend oil and natural gas the assets owned by these borrowers which make this activity possible are fieldlevel gathering systems small diameter pipe pipelines mediumlarge diameter pipe tanks trucks rail cars various waterbased vessels and natural gas treatment plants our midstream loans are secured by these assets unless the borrower is rated investmentgrade the majority of our midstream borrowers’ revenues are derived from feebased contracts giving them limited exposure to commodity price risk since lower oil and gas prices slow the drilling and development of new oil and natural gas but do not normally result in significant numbers of producing wells being shut in volumes of oil and gas flowing through midstream systems usually remain relatively stable 

throughout oil and natural gas price cycles during the 20082009 period of oil and gas price volatility classified loans in the midstream segment peaked at a lower level than the upstream and energy services segments 

energy services 

energy service loans which include oilfield services and energy service manufacturing in schedule 22 comprised approximately 45 of the company’s energyrelated exposure as of december 31 2014 energy service loans include borrowers that have a concentration of revenues to the energy industry however many of these borrowers provide a broad range of products and services to the energy industry and are not subject to the same volatility as new drilling activities many of these borrowers are diversified geographically and service both oil and gas related drilling and production 

for energy service loans underwriting criteria requires lower leverage to compensate for the cyclical nature of the industry during the company’s underwriting process we use sensitivity analysis to consider revenue and cash flow impacts resulting from oil and gas price cycles generally we underwrite energy service loans to withstand a 2050 decline in cash flows with higher discounts for those borrowers subject to greater cyclicality 

risk management of the energyrelated portfolio 

the company applies concentration limits and disciplined underwriting to its entire energyrelated portfolio in order to limit its risk exposure concentration limits on energyrelated lending coupled with adherence to the company’s underwriting standards served to constrain loan growth during the past several quarters as an indicator of the diversity of our energyrelated portfolio’s size the average amount of our commitments is approximately 8 million with approximately 60 of the commitments less than 30 million the portfolio contains only senior loans – no junior or second lien positions additionally the company generally avoids making first lien loans to borrowers that employ significant leverage through the use of junior lien loans or large unsecured senior tranches of debt more than 90 of the total energyrelated portfolio is secured by reserves equipment real estate and other collateral or a combination of collateral types lending arrangements that are not secured are generally to investment grade borrowers 

for efficiency purposes and to further reduce concentration risk the company participates as a lender in loans and commitments designated as shared national credits “sncs” which are generally larger and more diversified borrowers that have better access to capital markets sncs are loans or loan commitments of at least 20 million that are shared by three or more federally supervised institutions the percentage of sncs is 80 in the upstream portfolio 77 in the midstream portfolio and 50 in the energy services portfolio our bankers have direct access and contact with the management of these snc borrowers and as such are active participants in many cases the company provides ancillary banking services to these borrowers further evidencing this direct relationship 

as a secondary source of support many of our energyrelated borrowers have access to capital markets and private equity sources approximately 45 of our exposure is to public companies andor to those who have private equity sponsors private sponsors tend to be large funds often with assets under management of more than 1 billion managed by individuals with a great deal of energy expertise and experience and who have successfully managed energy investments through previous energy price cycles the investors in the funds are believed to be primarily institutional investors such as large pensions foundations trusts and high net worth family offices 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 observed credit quality in the energyrelated portfolio based on most recent borrower financial statements remained strong and was relatively unchanged from the third quarter during the fourth quarter of 2014 the company conducted certain sensitivity analyses and based on those analyses subjected certain energyrelated credits to further scrutiny resulting in a small number of credit downgrades the fact that the decline in energy prices has basically taken place within one quarter makes it difficult yet to see measurable changes to the financial condition of many energyrelated borrowers which is a primary driver of individual loan risk grades such risk grades in turn are a primary driver of the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses nevertheless the company recognizes that some of its energyrelated credits likely have incurred losses assuming 

current levels of oil and gas prices persist therefore it made changes to certain qualitative adjustment factors that had the effect of increasing the allowance for credit losses by approximately 25 million 

finally in addition to reevaluating certain credits and bolstering the allowance for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company has initiated the process of interim borrowing base redeterminations on a few selected borrowers this is expected to result in some reduction of the size of the lines of credit available to those borrowers and may result in some credit downgrades as borrowers provide updated financial statements and the borrowing bases of exploration and production credits are updated however the company believes it is prudent to take early action for the few selected borrowers and secure additional collateral reduce commitments etc rather than wait for the normal borrowing base redetermination period in the spring of 2015 

commercial real estate loans

schedule 23 

commercial real estate portfolio by loan type and collateral location 

at december 31 2014 



1 no other geography exceeds 83 million for all three loan types 

2 delinquency rates include nonaccrual loans 

approximately 23 of the cre term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2014 for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to seven years the remaining 77 of cre loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project loantovalue ratio and occupancy rates   

approximately 208 million or 17 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2014 consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements required equity infusions upon a decline in value of the collateral are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily projects we look for substantial preleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan significant consideration is given to the likely market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered and validated independent of the loan officer and the borrower generally by each bank’s internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used appraisals are ordered from outside appraisers at the inception renewal or for cre loans upon the occurrence of any event causing a downgrade to an adverse grade ie “criticized” or “classified” we increase the frequency of obtaining updated appraisals for adversely graded credits when declining market conditions exist 

advance rates ie loan commitments will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and homes not under contract and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally loanbyloan reviews of pass grade loans for all commercial and residential construction and land development loans are performed semiannually at amegy cbt nbaz nsb vectra and zions bank while tcbo and tcbw perform such reviews annually 

interest reserves are generally established as a loan disbursement budget item for real estate construction or development loans we generally require borrowers to inject their equity into the project prior to loan disbursements which ensures the availability of equity to complete the project we monitor the construction sales andor leasing progress to determine whether or not the project remains viable if at any time during the life of the credit the project is determined not to be viable including the adequacy of the remaining interest reserves the bank takes appropriate action to protect its collateral position via negotiation andor legal action as deemed 

necessary at december 31 2014 and 2013 zions’ affiliates had 656 and 609 loans with an outstanding balance of 801 million and 715 million where available interest reserves amounted to 108 million and 104 million respectively in instances where projects are in default and have been determined not to be viable the interest reserves and other disbursements have been frozen as appropriate 

we have not been involved to any meaningful extent with insurance arrangements credit derivatives or any other default agreements as a mitigation strategy for cre loans however we do make use of personal or other guarantees as risk mitigation strategies 

cre loans are sometimes modified to increase the likelihood of collecting the maximum possible amount of the company’s investment in the loan in general the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing a loan for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes into consideration this repayment source 

additionally when we modify or extend a loan we give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether we have granted a concession in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists however if additional collateral is obtained or if a strong guarantor exists who is believed to be able and willing to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation performance of other related projects with which we are familiar and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance the company estimates previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared to the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

consumer loans 

the company has mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality historically the company’s practice has been to sell “conforming” fixedrate loans to third parties including fannie mae and freddie mac for which it makes representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards it has also been the company’s practice historically to hold variable rate loans in its portfolio we actively monitor loan “putbacks” required repurchases of loans previously sold to fannie mae or freddie mac due to inadequate documentation or other reasons loan putbacks have been minimal over a multipleyear period we estimate that the company does not have any material risk as a result of either its foreclosure practices or loan putbacks and has not established any reserves related to these items 

the company is engaged in home equity credit line “hecl” lending at december 31 2014 the company’s hecl portfolio totaled 23 billion approximately 12 billion of the portfolio is secured by first deeds of trust while the remaining 11 billion is secured by junior liens 

as of december 31 2014 loans representing approximately 4 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateral value at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination 

more than 95 of the company’s hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 35 is scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years however most of the loans are expected to be renewed for a second 10year period after a satisfactory review of the borrower’s credit history and ability to repay the loan the company regularly analyzes the risk of borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates the analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment the annualized credit losses for the hecl portfolio were 5 bps and 23 bps for 2014 and 2013 respectively see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit quality of this portfolio 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming lendingrelated assets as a percentage of loans and leases and oreo decreased significantly to 081 at december 31 2014 compared with 115 at december 31 2013 

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2014 decreased by 99 million from the prior year primarily due to a 50 million decrease in commercial owner occupied loans and a 36 million decrease in commercial real estate term loans the largest total decreases in nonaccrual loans occurred at zions bank and cbt 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” on page 73 for more information company policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to commercial real estate term loans see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

restructured loans 

tdrs are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties and for which the company has granted a concession that it would not otherwise consider tdrs declined 29 during 2014 commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such consumer loan tdrs may include firstlien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 

for certain tdrs we split the loan into two new notes – an “a” note and a “b” note the a note is structured to comply with our current lending standards at current market rates and is tailored to suit the customer’s ability to make timely principal and interest payments the b note includes the granting of the concession to the borrower and varies by situation we may defer principal and interest payments until the a note has been paid in full at the time of restructuring the a note is identified and classified as a tdr the b note is charged off but the obligation is not forgiven to the borrower and any payments collected on the b notes are accounted for as recoveries the outstanding carrying value of loans restructured using the ab note strategy was approximately 112 million and 126 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that the company is reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether or not a loan should be returned to accrual status 

schedule 25 

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 



in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure company policy requires that the removal of tdr status be approved at the same management level that approved the upgrading of a loan’s classification see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs

other nonperforming assets 

in addition to lendingrelated nonperforming assets the company had 4 million in carrying value 56 million at amortized cost of investments in debt securities primarily bank and insurance company cdos that were on nonaccrual status at december 31 2014 compared to 224 million in carrying value 239 million at amortized cost at december 31 2013 during 2014 we sold a significant portion of nonperforming securities in an effort to reduce risk and maximize the use of capital because these securities were estimated to consume a significant amount of capital under the doddfrank act stress test 

allowance and reserve for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

schedule 27 shows the changes in the allowance for loan losses and a summary of loan loss experience

schedule 28 provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation among the portfolio segments 

schedule 28 

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 



the total alll declined during 2014 by 141 million due to the positive credit trends experienced in our major loan portfolio segments and due to reductions in outstanding balances of construction and land development loans however during the fourth quarter of 2014 the company increased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to account for the increased risk of loss on loans that are likely to be affected by the sharp decline in oil prices and more moderate decline in natural gas prices that occurred during the quarter 

the total alll at december 31 2013 decreased by 150 million compared to december 31 2012 the decreases in the alll reflected improvements in credit quality trends and somewhat improving economic conditions in some of our markets the company decreased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to reflect the positive credit quality trends and stabilizing economic conditions 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is separately shown in the company’s balance sheet and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are shown separately in the statement of income the reserve decreased by 86 million compared to december 31 2013 primarily driven by improvements in credit quality metrics and reductions in commitments of construction and land development loans but partially offset by an increase in other unfunded loan commitments 

see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses and credit trends experienced in each portfolio segment 

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company including interest rate and market risk management the boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews limit exceptions reported by management the board has established the assetliability committee “alco” consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the company among its other responsibilities alco’s primary responsibility for managing interest rate and market risk includes the following 

 interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have net interest income increase in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise the asset sensitivity of the company’s balance sheet changed minimally during 2014 

due to the low level of rates and the natural lower bound of zero for market indices there is limited sensitivity to falling rates at the current time and the company has tended to operate near its interest rate risk triggers and appetites noted in schedule 29 following however if interest rates remain at their current historically low levels given the company’s asset sensitivity it would expect its net interest margin to be under continuing modest pressure assuming a stable balance sheet in order to mitigate this pressure in 2014 the company began incrementally deploying cash and money market instruments into shorttomedium duration hqlaqualifying passthrough agency residential mortgage backed securities during 2014 it increased its hqla securities by approximately 10 billion and it expects to continue purchasing hqla securities at a pace of 15 to 20 billion in 2015 and possibly beyond we expect these purchases to mitigate but not eliminate the company’s asset sensitivity over time 

we attempt to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income primarily through the use of interest rate floors on variable rate loans interest rate swaps interest rate futures and by avoiding large exposures to longterm fixed rate interestearning assets that could experience a substantially slower return of principal in a rising rate environment eg 30year passthrough mortgagebacked securities our earning assets are largely tied to the shorter end of the interest rate curve the prime lending rate and the libor curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods economic value of equity “eve” and net interest income simulation in the eve method we measure the expected changes in the fair values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the net interest income simulation method we analyze the expected change in net interest income in response to changes in interest rates 

eve is calculated as the fair value of all assets and derivative instruments minus the fair value of liabilities we measure changes in the dollar amount of eve for parallel shifts in interest rates due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in eve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney caps on loans which have little effect for small rate movements but may become important if larger rate shocks were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for low rate mortgages in a higher rate environment the company’s policy is to limit declines in eve to 4 per 100 bps movement in interest rates in either direction schedule 29 presents the formal limits adopted by the 

company ’ s board of directors changes or exceptions to the eve limits are subject to notification and approval by the risk oversight committee of the company’s board of directors 

schedule 29 

economic value of equity decline limits 



net interest income simulation is an estimate of the total net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income is measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio eg a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lower rate environment for net interest income simulation company policy requires that net interest income from a static balance sheet be limited to a decline of no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps 

each of these measurement methods requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of eve and net interest income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is actively managed to maintain an assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

the estimated eve and net interest income simulation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking and savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these estimates we view both the eve and the net interest income simulation results as falling within a wide range of possibilities management uses historical regression analysis as a guide to setting such assumptions however due to the current low interest rate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit durations may not reflect actual future results even modest variation of such assumptions may have significant impact on the calculation of income simulation and economic value of equity shown below these assumptions are as follows 

schedule 30 

repricing scenario assumptions by deposit product 



note effective duration measures the percent change in eve for a 100 bps parallel shift in rates as compared to the macaulay duration which measures weighted average life of cash flows in years and is not reported the company’s demand deposit model assumes significant runoff of noninterestbearing deposits in the event of rising interest rates 

as of the dates indicated the following schedule shows the company’s percentage change in net interest rate sensitive income based on a static balance sheet in the first year after the rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps the company estimates interest rate risk with two sets of deposit repricing scenarios 

the first scenario assumes that administeredrate deposits money market interestearning checking and savings reprice at a faster speed in response to changes in interest rates in the current low rate environment significant declines in interest rates from current levels are deemed less likely and therefore the magnitude of downward rate shocks is limited at december 31 2014 and 2013 interest rates were at such a low level that repricing scenarios assuming 100 bps rate shocks produced negative results 

the second scenario assumes that those deposits reprice at a slower speed for larger rate shocks eg 300 bps models reflecting consumer behavior in regards to both loan prepayments and deposit runoff are inherently prone to increased model uncertainty 

schedule 31 

income simulation – change in net interest income 





schedule 32 includes changes in the eve from 100 bps to 300 bps parallel rate moves for both “fast” and “slow” scenarios 

schedule 32 

changes in economic value of equity 





during 2014 changes in both measures of interest rate sensitivity were among other things driven by 

 79 

in 2015 we expect to introduce a new modeling approach to monitor interest rate risk based on parallel testing during 2014 we expect the new model will show reduced asset sensitivity compared to schedule 32 particularly in the “slow” scenario 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 775 and 777 respectively of the company’s commercial lending and cre portfolios were variable rate and primarily tied to either the prime rate or   libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have variable interest rates see schedule 17 for further information on fixed and variable interest rates of the loan portfolio 

largely due to competitive pressures the favorable impact on loan yield from the use of interest rate floors has diminished as of december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 365 and 394 respectively of all of the company’s variable rate loan balances contain floors of the loans with floors approximately 585 and   645  of the balances at these same respective dates were priced at the floor rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 042   and 053 respectively 

at december 31 2014 the company held 275 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements of which 50 million each mature in 2018 and 2019 see notes 7 and 20   of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

market risk – fixed income 

the company engages in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2014 the company had a relatively small amount 71 million of trading assets and 24 million of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 35 million and 74 million respectively at december 31 2013 

the company is exposed to market risk through changes in fair value the company is also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2014 the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs and htm securities was an increase of 77 million compared to a 235 million increase in 2013 the primary reasons for the 77 million increase in 2014 are the sales of cdos and the observed improvement in market values of trust preferred cdos such market improvements may not be sustainable if any of the afs or htm securities become otherthantemporarily impaired the credit impairment is charged to operations see “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 for additional information on otti 

market risk – equity investments 

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded in addition the company owns equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and federal home loan banks that are not publicly traded the accounting for equity investments may use the cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since the fair value of these securities may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

the company holds investments in prepublic companies through various predominantly sbic venture capital funds the company’s equity exposure to these investments was approximately 86 million and 61 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

additionally amegy has an alternative investments portfolio these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds were generally not a part of the strategy since the underlying companies were typically not creditworthy the carrying value of amegy ’ s equity investments was 38 million and 54 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

these private equity investments are subject to the provisions of the doddfrank act the volcker rule of the doddfrank act as published on december 10 2013 prohibits banks and bank holding companies from holding private equity investments beyond july 21 2016 as currently extended except for sbic funds the federal reserve has announced its intention to act in 2015 to grant an additional oneyear extension to july 21 2017 as of december 31 2014 such prohibited private equity investments except for sbic funds amounted to 41 million with an additional 25 million of unfunded commitments see note 17 for more information the company currently does not believe that this divestiture requirement will ultimately have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

the company ’ s earnings from these investments and the potential volatility of these earnings are expected to decline over the next several years and will ultimately cease 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary bank levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines for example the “timetorequired funding” and fixed charges coverage ratios that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and subsidiary banks as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the parent and subsidiary banks’ liquidity 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally for the parent and jointly by the parent and bank management for its subsidiary banks zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division performs this management centrally under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the company’s liquidity policy these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policy also must be approved by the company’s enterprise risk management committee and the board of directors the company has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk including a target for the parent ’ s timetorequired funding of 1824 months with a minimum policy limit of not less than 12 months throughout 2014 and as of december 31 2014 the company complied with this policy 

the subsidiary banks have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and the federal reserve and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank andor correspondent banks the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer 

liquidity regulation 

in september 2014 us banking regulators issued a final rule that implements a quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under this rule the company is subject to a modified lcr standard which 

requires a financial institution to hold an adequate amount of unencumbered high quality liquid assets “hqla” that can be converted into cash easily and immediately in private markets to meet its liquidity needs for a shortterm liquidity stress scenario although this rule is not applicable to the company and other banks of its size until january 2016 the company has calculated that it is in compliance with the requirement to maintain a modified lcr of at least 100 

the company is required to and is conducting monthly liquidity stress tests as of january 2015 these tests incorporate scenarios designed by the company subject to review by the federal reserve 

the basel iii liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” which requires a financial institution to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the characteristics of its on and offbalance sheet activities on october 31 2014 the basel committee on banking supervision issued its final standards for this ratio entitled basel iii the net stable funding ratio based upon this basel iii publication we believe the company would meet the minimum nsfr if such requirement were currently effective however the federal reserve has not yet proposed regulations to implement these basel committee standards the company is monitoring these developments 

contractual obligations 

schedule 33 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2014  

schedule 33 

contractual obligations 



 

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 33 the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of its business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

liquidity management actions 

consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements at the parent and its subsidiaries decreased slightly to 92 billion at december 31 2014  from 93 billion at december 31 2013  the 01 billion decrease during 2014  resulted primarily from 1 repayments of debt 2 net loan originations and purchases and 3 dividends on preferred and common stock these decreases in cash were partially offset by 1 an increase in deposits 2 the issuance of common stock and 3 net cash provided by operating activities 

parent company liquidity – the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes and longterm debt and equity issuances 

cash and interestbearing deposits held as investments at the parent increased to 10 billion at december 31 2014  from 09 billion at december 31 2013  the 01 billion increase during 2014  was primarily a result of 1 the issuance of common stock 2 sales and paydowns of cdo securities and 3 dividends received from subsidiaries these increases were partially offset by 1 repayments of approximately 11 billion of senior notes and 106 million of subordinated notes 2 interest payments on debt and 3 the payment of preferred and common dividends the issuance of 525 million of common stock during 2014 consisted of approximately 176 million shares at a price of 2980 per share net of commissions and fees this issuance added approximately 516 million to common stock see notes 12 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s longterm debt and equity transactions 

during 2015 the company expects to redeem highcost longterm debt including debt from maturities and from early optional redemption provisions the parent’s longterm debt maturities in 2015 include 

schedule 34 

longterm debt maturities in 2015 



in addition at december 31 2014 the company had optional early redemptions totaling  27 million  of longterm senior notes during 2015 on february 17 2015 80 million of this amount was redeemed 

during 2014  the parent received common dividends and return of common equity totaling 190 million and preferred dividends totaling 46 million from its subsidiary banks during 2013 the parent received from its subsidiary banks 377 million for common dividends and return of common equity 45 million for preferred dividends and 175 million from the redemption of preferred stock issued to the parent the dividends that our subsidiary banks can pay to the parent are restricted by current and historical earning levels retained earnings and riskbased and other regulatory capital requirements and limitations during 2014  all of the company’s subsidiary 

banks recorded a profit except for tcbo which operated at approximately breakeven we expect that this profitability will be sustained thus permitting continued payments of dividends by the subsidiaries to the parent during 2015 

general financial market and economic conditions impact the company’s access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the debt ratings and outlooks issued by the various rating agencies for the company did not change during 2014  except that fitch’s outlook for the company was revised to stable from positive standard  poor’s fitch dominion bond rating service “dbrs” and kroll all rate the company’s senior debt at an investment grade level while moody’s rates the company’s senior debt as ba1 one notch below investment grade in addition all of the previously mentioned rating agencies except kroll rate the company’s subordinated debt as noninvestment grade 

schedule 35 presents the parent’s ratings as of december 31 2014

credit ratings 



the parent’s cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses decreased to 96 million in 2014 from 126 million in 2013 as a result of a net repayment of debt of 12 billion and 02 billion during 2014 and 2013 respectively cash payments for interest is expected to continue to decrease during 2015 as a result of the debt repayments during 2014 and the expected debt repayments during 2015 

additionally the parent paid approximately 96 million and 120 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock during 2014 and 2013 respectively preferred stock dividends were lower during 2014  compared to 2013  primarily as a result of the replacement of the 95 series c preferred stock with lowerrate series g h i and j preferred stock during the first three quarters of 2013 

note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and cash flows for 2014  2013  and 2012  as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2014  and 2013  

at december 31 2014  maturities of the company’s longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from september 2015 to september 2028 with effective interest rates from 330 to 695 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of the company’s longterm debt 

subsidiary bank liquidity – the subsidiary banks’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2014  these core deposits excluding brokered deposits in aggregate constituted 973 of consolidated deposits compared with 971 at december 31 2013  on a consolidated basis the company’s net loan to total deposit ratio is 837 as of december 31 2014  compared to 842 as of december 31 2013  

during 2014 the company repaid amegy’s 75 million subordinated note which matured on september 22 2014 

deposit growth during 2014 was very strong total deposits increased by 15 billion from 463 billion at december 31 2013 to 478 billion at december 31 2014 mainly due to increases of 18 billion in noninterestbearing demand deposits and 15 billion in savings deposits these increases were partly offset primarily by a decrease of 16 billion in foreign deposits and 02 billion in time deposits the company experienced a significant reduction in foreign deposits as a result of closing some of its cayman islands operations these foreign deposits were transferred to domestic savings and money market deposit accounts 

also during 2014 the subsidiary banks redeployed approximately 10 billion in interestbearing deposits held as investments to security resell agreements 

the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and from time to time have been a significant source of funding for each of the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank tcbw and tcbo are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nbaz are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy bank is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements the subsidiary banks are required to invest in fhlb and federal reserve stock to maintain their borrowing capacity 

at december 31 2014  the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 164 billion loans with a carrying value of approximately 225 billion at december 31 2014  and 230 billion at december 31 2013  have been pledged at the federal reserve and various fhlbs as collateral for current and potential borrowings the company had a de minimis amount approximately 22 million of longterm borrowings outstanding with the fhlb at december 31 2014  which was a slight decrease from 23 million at december 31 2013  the company had no shortterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding at december 31 2014  which was unchanged from december 31 2013  at december 31 2014  and 2013  the subsidiary banks’ total investment in fhlb stock was approximately 104 million and 105 million respectively the subsidiary banks’ total investment in federal reserve stock was approximately 121 million at both december 31 2014  and 2013  

the company’s investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture taken during 2014  investment securities’ activities resulted in a net increase in investment securities and a net 71 million decrease in cash compared with a net 246 million decrease in cash for 2013  

maturing balances in our subsidiary banks’ loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows lending and purchase activity for 2014  resulted in a net cash outflow of 11 billion compared to a net cash outflow of 15 billion for 2013  

during 2014  the company paid income taxes of 183 million compared to 181 million during 2013  

operational risk management 

operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has an enterprise risk management department whose responsibility is to help employees management and the board to assess understand measure monitor and manage risk in accordance with the company’s risk appetite framework we have documented both controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

to manage and minimize its operational risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate the company’s systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to those systems to the company’s legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data 

further we undertake significant efforts to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters we also mitigate operational risk through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

the company is continually improving its oversight of operational risk including enhancement of risk identification risk and control selfassessments and antifraud measures which are reported to the operational risk committee the enterprise risk management committee and the risk oversight committee of the board on a regular basis late in 2013 the company further improved operational risk management by creating and staffing the position of director of corporate operational risk in order to consolidate and enhance its risk oversight functions 

the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate the company’s critical systems sometimes referred to as hacking cyberfraud cyberattacks cyberterrorism or other similar names also continue to grow on a daily basis the company its customers and other financial institutions are subject to a large number of such attempts the company has established systems and procedures to monitor thwart or mitigate damage from such attempts however in some instances we or our customers have been victimized by cyberfraud related losses to the company have not been material or some of our customers have been temporarily unable to routinely access our online systems as a result of for example distributed denial of service attacks the company continues to review this area of its operations to help ensure that we manage this risk in an effective manner 

capital management 

overview 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary banks other major cmc responsibilities include 

 the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

 

capital plan and stress tests 

the cmc oversees the company’s capital stress testing under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios the company has established processes to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the company under hypothetical economic scenarios these stress tests facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity within quantitative limits reflecting the board of directors’ risk appetite these processes are also used to complete the company’s dfast as required by the doddfrank act and ccar as required by the federal reserve 

filing a capital plan with the federal reserve based on stresstesting and documented sound policies processes models controls and governance practices and the subsequent review by the federal reserve is an annual regulatory requirement this capital plan which is subject to objection by the federal reserve governs all of the company’s capital and significant unsecured debt financing actions for a period of five quarters among the actions governed by the capital plan are the repurchase of outstanding capital securities and the timing of new capital issuances and whether the company can pay or increase dividends any such action not included in a capital plan to which the federal reserve has not objected cannot be executed without submission of a revised stress test and capital plan for federal reserve review and nonobjection de minimis changes are allowed without a complete plan resubmission subject to receipt of a federal reserve nonobjection regulations require company disclosure of these stress tests results the company submitted its 2015 capital plan to the federal reserve on january 5 2015 the federal reserve has indicated it will announce the results of its ccar 2015 review by midmarch 

the company originally submitted its 2014 capital plan to the federal reserve on january 6 2014 the company subsequently notified the federal reserve of its intention to resubmit its capital plan to reflect the impact of the volcker rule and the impact of its decision to sell certain cdo securities to improve the company’s risk profile in february 2014 the federal reserve granted its approval for a resubmission in march 2014 the federal reserve notified the company that based upon its original capital plan the company’s capital ratios would not have met certain minimum requirements of the federal reserve’s capital adequacy rules under results projected by the federal reserve using the hypothetical severely adverse economic stress scenario in the doddfrank act stress test “dfast” the dfast results were worse than those projected by the company with regard to pretax preprovision net revenue and credit losses for some loan types 

under the federal reserve’s capital planning rules this failure to maintain required minimum capital ratios as projected by the federal reserve under its severely adverse stress scenario triggered a requirement that the company conduct a new stress test and submit a new capital plan the company resubmitted its 2014 capital plan and stress test on april 30 2014 to the federal reserve the resubmitted plan incorporated the impact of the ifr cdo exemption the impact of the sales of cdo securities that occurred in the first quarter of 2014 and an increase in the amount of new common equity that the company proposed to issue to 400 million 

on july 25 2014 the federal reserve announced that it did not object to the company’s 2014 resubmitted capital plan the poststress tier 1 common ratio computed by the federal reserve met the ccar requirements however the company determined to increase the new common equity issuance to 525 million as discussed previously 

capital management actions 

total shareholders’ equity increased by 141 from 65 billion at december 31 2013  to 74 billion at december 31 2014  the increase in total shareholders’ equity is primarily due to the issuance of 5250 million of common stock 3985 million of net income and a 769 million improvement in net unrealized losses on investment securities recorded in aoci partially offset by 1031 million of dividends recorded on preferred and common stock the improvement in net unrealized losses on investment securities during 2014  was primarily the result of an increase in the fair value of investment securities partially offset by the recognition in earnings of net fixed income securities gains on investment securities sold 

the company has maintained its quarterly dividend on common stock at 004 per share since the second quarter of 2013 which was an increase of 003 per share from the 001 per share paid during the first quarter of 2013 and during each quarter of 2012 the company paid 313 million in dividends on common stock during 2014  compared to 241 million during 2013  during its january 2015 meeting the board of directors declared a dividend of 004 per common share payable on february 26 2015 to shareholders of record on february 19 2015 

the company recorded preferred stock dividends of 719 million for 2014  and 955 million for 2013  the current annualized run rate of preferred dividends is approximately 63 million annually or approximately 15 million to 16 million quarterly consistent with the amounts recorded during the last three quarters of 2014 

banking organizations are required by capital regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios the company’ capital ratios as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  under basel i are shown in schedule 36 also shown are pro forma ratios as of december 31 2014 under basel iii which is discussed subsequently

note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information on riskbased capital 

at december 31 2014  regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital were 66 billion and 74 billion respectively compared to 58 billion and 66 million at december 31 2013  

basel iii 

the basel iii capital rules which effectively replaced the basel i rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components in 2013 the frb fdic and occ published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the rules implement the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revise the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company compared to the current us riskbased capital rules 

a detailed discussion of basel iii requirements including implications for the company are contained on page 8 of the “supervision and regulation” section under part 1 item 1 in this annual report on form 10k 

the company believes that as of december 31 2014  the company and its subsidiary banks would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective see schedule 38 regarding the pro forma basel iii ratios at december 31 2014 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

1 tier 1 common capital 

traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulators have assessed a bank’s capital adequacy based on tier 1 capital the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations in 2013 the frb issued final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations including the new cet1 capital measure the new capital rules became effective for the company on january 1 2015 however some key regulatory changes to the calculation of this measure are phased in over several years the cet1 capital ratio is the core capital component of the basel iii standards and we believe that it increasingly is becoming a key ratio considered by regulators investors and analysts there is a difference between this ratio calculated using basel i definitions of t1c capital and those definitions using basel iii rules we present the calculation of key regulatory capital ratios including t1c capital using the governing definition at the end of each quarter taking into account applicable phasein rules 

t1c capital is often expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets under the current riskbased capital framework applicable to the company a bank’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of offbalance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad “basel i” risk categories for banks like our subsidiary banks that have not adopted the basel ii “advanced measurement approach” the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the riskweighted assets total that as adjusted comprises the denominator of certain riskbased capital ratios tier 1 capital is then divided by this denominator riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 capital ratio adjustments are made to tier 1 capital to arrive at t1c capital t1c capital is also divided by the riskweighted assets to determine the t1c capital ratio the amounts disclosed as riskweighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements

for items 3 and 4 the identified adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are included where applicable in financial results or in the balance sheet presented in accordance with gaap we consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and financial position 

we believe that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the nongaap financial measures provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which will assist regulators investors and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the company and in 

predicting future performance these nongaap financial measures are used by management to assess the performance of the company’s business or its financial position for evaluating bank reporting segment performance for presentations of the company’s performance to investors and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts we further believe that presenting these nongaap financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap

competition 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks credit unions and thrifts including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies and a variety of other types of companies many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered the quality of service delivered and pricing the company must compete effectively along all of these dimensions to remain successful 

supervision and regulation 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended among other things to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers including both loan customers and depositors these regulations are not however generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the company the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the company 

the parent is a bank holding company and a financial holding company as provided by the bhc act as modified by the glb act and the doddfrank act these and other federal statutes provide the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the frb the supervision of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a bank holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator and the laws and regulations administered by those regulators the glb act allows our subsidiary banks to engage in certain financial activities through financial subsidiaries to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company or to do business through a financial subsidiary the parent and its subsidiary banks must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required 

the parent’s subsidiary banks and zions trust are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or other statutes governing national banks or for those that are statechartered banks the banking laws of their various states as well as the rules and regulations of the occ for those that are national banks and the fdic they are 

also subject to periodic examination and supervision by the occ or their respective state banking departments and the fdic many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other federal and state agencies these bank regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination role our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec finra andor state securities regulators 

the doddfrank act 

the recent financial crisis led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the united states 

the doddfrank act and regulations adopted under the doddfrank act broadly affect the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities requiring ongoing stress testing of our capital mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector among other things affecting capital standards the doddfrank act provides that 

 regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act will require us to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets than was generally the case before the crisis and will limit the forms of capital that we will be able to rely upon for regulatory purposes for example provisions of the doddfrank act require us to transition trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital to tier 2 capital over a twoyear period that begins january 1 2015 in 2015 75 of trust preferred securities transition to tier 2 capital from tier 1 and the remaining 25 in 2016 in addition in its supervisory role with respect to our stress testing and capital planning our ability to deliver returns to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases is subject to prior nonobjection by the frb the stress testing and capital plan process also could substantially reduce our flexibility to respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and pricing of certain products and services including the following 

 the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the cfpb also enacted new regulations which became fully effective january 10 2014 which require significant changes to residential mortgage origination these changes include definition of a “qualified mortgage” and requirement regarding how a borrower’s “ability to repay” must be determined the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further 

regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws which had enabled national banks and their subsidiaries to comply with federal regulatory requirements without complying with various state laws in addition the act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

the doddfrank act contains numerous provisions that limit or place significant burdens and costs on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds for the affected activities these provisions may result in increased compliance and other costs increased legal risk and decreased scope of product offerings and earning assets 

on december 10 2013 the federal banking regulators the sec and the cftc published the final volcker rule pursuant to the doddfrank act the rule significantly restricts certain activities by covered bank holding companies including restrictions on proprietary trading and private equity investing on january 14 2014 these regulators revised the volcker rule’s application to certain cdo securities through publication of an interim final rule related to primarily bank trust preferred cdos this ifr clarified that primarily bank trust preferred cdos were not prohibited investments for bank holding companies and therefore not subject to the volcker rule divestiture requirements the company’s fourth quarter 2013 financial results incorporated all of the immediate impact that resulted from the volcker rule and the ifr however the company may experience additional impacts in future quarters for example as cdos and other investments are sold  see “subsequent event” on page 61 in addition while the company concluded it still had the ability to hold 358 million of disallowed insurance cdos with 67 million of unrealized losses in oci to recovery of their amortized cost basis the company will reassess this conclusion quarterly the company also has 58 million of private equity securities prohibited by the volcker rule and is evaluating options to dispose of these securities with minimal negative impact 

the company and other companies subject to the doddfrank act are subject to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules these requirements generally implement the compensation restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act and include documentation and governance deferral risk balancing and clawback requirements 

as discussed further throughout this section many aspects of doddfrank are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company or the industry 

capital standards – basel framework 

the frb has established capital guidelines for bank holding companies the occ the fdic and the frb have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks these bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the bcbs the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply 

in july 2013 the frb published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the fdic and the occ have adopted substantially identical rules in the case of the fdic as interim final rules the rules implement the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revise the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company compared to the current us riskbased capital rules the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing riskweighting approach which was derived from basel i capital accords of the basel committee with a more risksensitive approach based in part on the standardized approach in the basel committee’s 2004 basel ii capital 

accords the basel iii capital rules also implement the requirements of section 939a of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules the basel iii capital rules are effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components 

the basel iii capital rules among other things i introduce a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” ii specify that tier 1 capital consist of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements iii apply most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and iv expand the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratios as of january 1 2015 will be as follows 

 when fully phased in on january 1 2019 the basel iii capital rules will also require the company and its subsidiary banks to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum capital ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 

the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

the basel iii capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 the company’s preliminary analysis indicates that application of this part of the rule should not result in any deductions from cet1 the “corresponding deduction approach” section of the basel iii capital rules would if the rules were phased in immediately eliminate a significant portion approximately 628 million of 1004 million of the company’s noncommon tier 1 capital pro forma incorporating sales of cdos in january and february 2014 in addition deductions from tier 2 capital would arise from our concentrated investment in insuranceonly trust preferred cdo securities these deductions will not begin until january 1 2015 for the company and even after january 1 2015 they will be phasedin in portions over time through the beginning of 2018 as indicated below thus the impact may be mitigated prior to or during the phasein period by repayment determination of other than temporary impairment “otti” additional accumulation of retained earnings andor additional sales of cdo securities 

under current capital standards the effects of aoci items included in capital are excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios under the basel iii capital rules the effects of certain aoci items are not excluded however “nonadvanced approaches banking organizations” including the company and its subsidiary banks may make a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items the company’s ccar 2014 capital plan as submitted incorporated the assumption that the company would “opt out” that is exclude these items however this decision is not binding until the first quarter of 2015 the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 will be phased in incrementally between january 1 2015 and january 1 2018 

the basel iii capital rules require that trust preferred securities be phased out from tier 1 capital by the end of 2015 although for a banking organization such as the company that has greater than 15 billion in total consolidated assets but is not an “advanced approaches banking organization” the basel iii capital rules permit permanent inclusion of trust preferred securities issued prior to may 19 2010 in tier 2 capital regardless of whether they would otherwise meet the qualifications for tier 2 capital 

with respect to the company’s subsidiary banks the basel iii capital rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act by i introducing a cet1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level other than critically undercapitalized with the required cet1 ratio being 65 for wellcapitalized status ii increasing the minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category with the minimum tier 1 capital ratio for wellcapitalized status being 8 as compared to the current 6 and iii requiring a leverage ratio of 4 to be adequately capitalized as compared to the current 3 leverage ratio for a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 and a leverage ratio of 5 to be wellcapitalized the basel iii capital rules do not change the total riskbased capital requirement for any “prompt corrective action” category 

the basel iii capital rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expand the riskweighting categories from the current four basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules also provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

the company believes that as of december 31 2013 the company and its subsidiary banks would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective including after giving effect to the deductions described above 

stress testing prudential standards and early remediation 

as a bank holding company with assets greater than 50 billion the company is required by the doddfrank act to participate in an annual stress test known as the federal reserve’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” the company timely submitted its capital plan and stress test results to the frb on january 6 2014 however the company has announced that it intends to resubmit its stress test and capital plan as a result of the publication of the interim final rule that modified the volcker rule as discussed previously and of the sale of some of its portfolio of cdo securities in january and february 2014 in its capital plan the company was required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios for nine quarters ending the fourth quarter of 2015 its estimated regulatory capital ratios under basel i rules its tier 1 common ratio under basel i rules the same ratios under basel iii rules and its gaap tangible common equity ratio in september 2013 the frb issued an interim final rule amending its capital plan and stress test rules to clarify how bank holding companies with over 50 billion in total consolidated assets should incorporate the recently adopted basel iii capital rules for the 2014 capital plan review process and the supervisory and company run stress tests under the frb’s interim final rule any such bank holding company must both i project its regulatory capital ratios and meet the required minimums under the basel iii capital rules for each quarter of the ninequarter planning horizon in accordance with the minimum capital requirements that are in effect during that quarter subject to appropriate phaseinsphaseouts under the new rules and ii continue to meet the minimum 5 tier 1 common ratio as calculated under the previously applicable riskbased capital rules under the implementing regulations for ccar a bank holding company may generally raise and redeem capital pay dividends and repurchase stock and take similar capitalrelated actions only under a capital plan as to which the frb has not objected 

on february 17 2014 the federal reserve published final rules to implement section 165 enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the board of governors and certain bank holding companies  of the doddfrank act the company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of these rules but believes that it already largely is in compliance with them 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act or “fdicia” requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia an insured depository institution generally will be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its total riskbased capital is less than 8 or its tier 1 riskbased capital or leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment under the fully phasedin basel iii capital rules i a new cet1 ratio requirement will be introduced at every level other than critically undercapitalized with the required cet1 ratio being 65 for wellcapitalized status ii the minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category will be increased with the minimum tier 1 capital ratio for wellcapitalized status being 8 and iii the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3 leverage ratio and still be wellcapitalized will be eliminated at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan 

other regulations 

the company is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

 11 

systems internal audit loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies the safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in their supervisory authority over us 

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a comprehensive system of corporate governance practices this system includes corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing some restrictions on the pledging of company stock by insiders and charters for the audit risk oversight executive compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit the tools available to the frb which may be used to implement monetary policy include 

 these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 




 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee of the board and an enterprise risk management policy and has appointed an enterprise risk management committee consisting of senior management to oversee and implement the policy in addition to credit and interest rate risk the committee also monitors the following risk areas strategic risk market risk liquidity risk compliance risk compensationrelated risk operational risk information technology risk and reputation risk 

the following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the company including but not limited to 

we have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

the united states and many other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession from which it is slowly recovering these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected the company’s assets including its loans and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition in response to the economic crisis the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis these programs and policies had a stabilizing effect in 

the united states following the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of 2008 but troubling economic conditions continue to exist in the united states and globally moreover some of these programs have begun to expire and the impact of their expiration on the financial industry and economic recovery is unknown it is possible economic conditions may again become more severe or that troubling economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time in addition economic and fiscal conditions in the united states and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic conditions faced by the company and its customers any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions including a recession or continued weak economic recovery would adversely affect the company 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

our subsidiary banks must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by their banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions or hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios and their particular condition risk profile and growth plans compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require capital investment from the parent and the need or requirement to raise additional capital these uncertainties and risks created by the legislative and regulatory uncertainties discussed above may themselves increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the united states 

as a regional bank holding company the company provides a full range of banking and related services through its banking and other subsidiaries in utah california texas arizona nevada colorado idaho washington and oregon approximately 85 of the company’s total net interest income for the year ended december 31 2013 and 77 of total assets as of december 31 2013 relate to the subsidiary banks in utah california and texas as a result of this geographic concentration our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas accordingly adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results for example our credit risk could be elevated to the extent our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics that are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events as of december 31 2013 loan balances at our subsidiary banks in utah california and texas comprised 81 of the company’s commercial lending portfolio 74 of the commercial real estate lending portfolio and 69 of the consumer lending portfolio loans originated by these banks are primarily to companies in their respective states 

catastrophic events including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and the company 

the company has significant operations and a significant customer base in utah texas california and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires floods and prolonged drought these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy the company’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to the company’s property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the company’s customers and in turn on the company a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us 

the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect 

financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us certain of our affiliates and particular classes of securities that we and our affiliates issue the interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we our affiliates andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies downgrades to us our affiliates or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue the management of interest rate risk for the company and its subsidiary banks is centralized and overseen by an asset liability management committee appointed by the company’s board of directors failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

the company remains in an “asset sensitive” interest rate risk position and the frb has stated its expectations that shortterm interest rates may remain low until unemployment is reduced to below 65 or inflationary expectations exceed 25 and perhaps beyond such a scenario may continue to create or exacerbate margin compression for us as a result of repricing of longerterm loans and pricing pressure on new loans 

our estimates of our interest rate risk position for noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on assumptions for which there is little historical experience and the actual behavior of those deposits in a changing interest rate environment may differ materially from our estimates which could materially affect our results of operations 

we have experienced a low interest rate environment for the past several years our views with respect to among other things the degree to which we are “assetsensitive” including our interest rate risk position for noninterestbearing demand deposits are dependent on modeled projections that rely on assumptions regarding changes in balances of such deposits in a changing interest rate environment because there is no modern precedent for this current prolonged low interest rate environment there is little historical experience upon which to base such assumptions if interest rates begin to increase our assumptions regarding changes in balances of noninterestbearing demand deposits and regarding the speed and degree to which other deposits are repriced may prove to be incorrect and business decisions made in reliance on our modeled projections and underlying assumptions could prove to be unsuccessful because noninterestbearing demand deposits are a significant portion of our deposit base errors in our modeled projections and the underlying assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

as a regulated entity we are subject to capital and liquidity requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth 

we are a bank holding company and a financial holding company as such we and our subsidiary banks are subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the federal reserve board the occ in the case of our national subsidiary banks and the fdic including riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements and basel iii liquidity requirements capital needs may rise above normal levels when we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition risk profile and growth plans in addition we may be required to increase our capital levels even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts as a result of stress testing and capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse 

economic scenarios compliance with the capital requirements including leverage ratios may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels for a summary of recently announced capital rules see “basel iii” in “capital management” on page 91 of mda in this form 10k 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

stress testing and capital management under doddfrank may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

under the ccar we are required to submit to the federal reserve each year our capital plan for the applicable planning horizon along with the results of required stress tests each annual capital plan will among other things specify our planned actions with respect to dividends redemptions repurchases capital raising and similar matters and will be subject to the objection or nonobjection by the federal reserve moreover the ccar process requires us to analyze the pro forma impact on our financial condition of various hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios selected by us or the federal reserve and to maintain or raise capital sufficient to meet our risk management and regulatory expectations under such hypothetical scenarios similarly stress tests required by the doddfrank act are devised by the occ and fdic for our subsidiary banks with assets in excess of 10 billion the severity of the hypothetical scenarios devised by the frb and other bank regulators and employed in these stress tests is undefined by law or regulation and is thus subject solely to the discretion of the regulators the stress testing and capital planning processes may among other things require us to increase our capital levels modify our business strategies or decrease our exposure to various asset classes 

under stress testing and capital management standards implemented by bank regulatory agencies under the doddfrank act we may declare dividends repurchase common stock redeem preferred stock and debt access capital markets for certain types of capital make acquisitions and enter into similar transactions only with bank regulatory approval any transactions not contemplated in our annual capital plan will require frb approval these requirements may significantly limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

increases in fdic insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings 

our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and accordingly we are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments   during 2008 and 2009 higher levels of bank failures dramatically increased resolution costs of the fdic and depleted the deposit insurance fund in addition the fdic instituted two temporary programs to further insure customer deposits at fdic insured banks these programs which were later extended by the doddfrank act have placed additional stress on the deposit insurance fund in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund the fdic has increased assessment rates of insured institutions further on january 12 2010 the fdic requested comments on a proposed rule tying assessment rates of fdicinsured institutions to the institution’s employee compensation programs the exact requirements of such a rule are not yet known but such a rule could increase the amount of premiums we must pay for fdic insurance further as described below under the doddfrank act the fdic must undertake several initiatives that will result in higher deposit insurance fees being paid to the fdic for example an fdic final rule issued on february 7 2011 revises the assessment system applicable to large banks and implements the use of assets as the base for deposit insurance assessments instead of domestic deposits we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance these announced increases and any future increases or required prepayments of fdic insurance premiums or special assessments may adversely impact our earnings 

the doddfrank act imposes significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank act has material implications for the company and the entire financial services industry the act places significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions including the company particularly those with more than 50 billion of assets in addition among other things the act 

 the company has incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel systems consulting and other costs in order to comply with new regulations promulgated under the doddfrank act particularly with respect to stress testing and risk management because the responsible agencies are still in the process of proposing and finalizing many of the regulations required under the doddfrank act the full impact of this legislation on the company its business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for some time individually and collectively regulations adopted under the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

other legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations 

in addition to the doddfrank act described above bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation 

there can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted however if adopted some of these proposals could adversely affect the company by among other things impacting after tax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting the company’s ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of the company’s funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that the company could offer and requiring the company to raise capital at inopportune times 

the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may be adopted 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the company to comply before their formal adoption 

the company provides to its customers invests in and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements therefore pose an ongoing risk 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

we are subject to risks associated with legal claims fines litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings the company’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies and increasingly aggressive enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations 

credit quality has adversely affected us and may adversely affect us in the future 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks if the strength of the us economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we and our subsidiary banks conduct operations declined this could result in among other things deterioration in credit quality andor reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 

failure to effectively manage our credit concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect us 

increases in concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the company concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the company due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk 

the quality and liquidity of our assetbacked investment securities portfolio has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

the company’s assetbacked investment securities portfolio includes cdos collateralized by trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies and insurance companies many factors some of which are beyond the company’s control significantly influence the fair value and impairment status of these securities these factors include but are not limited to defaults deferrals and restructurings by debt issuers the views of banking regulators changes in our accounting treatment with respect to these securities rating agency downgrades of securities lack of market pricing of securities or the return of market pricing that varies from the company’s current model valuations and changes in prepayment rates and future interest rates the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in additional otti charges with respect to our cdo portfolio which could be material 

the company may not be able to utilize the significant deferred tax asset recorded on its balance sheet 

the company’s balance sheet includes a significant deferred tax asset the largest components of this asset result from additions to our allowance for loan and lease losses for purposes of generally accepted accounting principles in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes and other than temporary impairment losses taken on our securities portfolio that have not yet been realized for tax purposes by selling the securities our ability to continue to record this deferred tax asset is dependent on the company’s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital in addition inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations there are immaterial amounts of deferred tax assets disallowed for regulatory purposes at some of the company’s subsidiary banks no deferred tax assets are disallowed at the parent level 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a 

significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations 

our information systems may experience an interruption or security breach 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems misappropriation of funds and theft of proprietary company or customer data while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

we are making a significant investment to replace our core loan and deposit systems and to upgrade our accounting systems the actual duration cost expected savings and other factors to implement these initiatives may vary significantly from our estimates which could materially affect the company including its results of operations 

during the second quarter of 2013 our board of directors approved a significant investment by us to replace our loan and deposit systems and to upgrade our accounting systems the new integrated system for most of our loans and deposits is expected to employ technology that is a significant improvement over our current systems these initiatives will be completed in phases to allow for appropriate testing and implementation so as to minimize time delays and cost overruns however these initiatives are in the early stages of development and by their very nature projections of duration cost expected savings and related items are subject to change and significant variability 

we may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these initiatives these may include significant time delays cost overruns and other adverse developments that could result in disruptions to our systems and adversely impact our customers 

we have plans policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these adverse developments however there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately remediated the occurrence of any adverse development could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could materially affect the company including its results of operations in any given reporting period 

our results of operations depend upon the performance of our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our banking and other subsidiaries we receive substantially all of our revenues from dividends from our subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt we and certain of our subsidiaries have experienced periods of unprofitability or reduced profitability since the financial crisis the ability of the company and our subsidiary banks to pay dividends is restricted by regulatory requirements including profitability and the need to maintain required levels of capital lack of profitability or reduced profitability exposes us to the risk that regulators could restrict the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends it also increases the risk that the company may have to establish a “valuation allowance” against its net deferred tax asset 

the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends or make other payments to us is also limited by their obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general regulatory restrictions on their dividends if they do not satisfy these regulatory requirements we may be unable to pay interest on our indebtedness the occ the primary regulator for certain of our subsidiary banks has issued policy statements generally requiring 

insured banks only to pay dividends out of current earnings in addition if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which could include the payment of dividends such authority may take actions requiring that such bank refrain from the practice payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if a subsidiary bank were to become “undercapitalized” for purposes of the applicable federal regulatory “prompt corrective action” regulations

executive summary 

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 56 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is considered a “systemically important financial institution” under the doddfrank act 

 

longterm strategy 

we strive to maintain a local community and regional bank approach for customerfacing elements of our business we believe that our target customers appreciate the local focus and fast decisionmaking provided by our local management teams by retaining a significant degree of autonomy in product offerings and pricing we believe our banks have a meaningful competitive advantage over larger national banks whose loan and deposit products are often homogeneous however we centralize or oversee centrally many noncustomer facing operations such as risk and capital management and technology and backoffice operations by centralizing many of these functions we believe we can generally achieve greater economies of scale and stronger risk management and that scale gives our portfolio of community banks superior access to capital markets and more robust treasury management and other product capabilities than smaller independent community banks   

our strategy is driven by four key factors 

 

focus on growth markets 

the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in growth markets the states in our western geographic footprint have on average experienced higher rates of population and economic growth than the rest of the country our footprint is well diversified by industry and enjoys strong business formation rates real estate development and general economic expansion 

 

while some states in our footprint experienced a significant slowing in economic activity during the recent recession others have experienced aboveaverage growth and stronger resistance to the economic downturn 

more than 75 of the company’s assets are located in utah california and texas zions bank has approximately 19 billion in assets which represent 33 of the company’s assets zions bank is the second largest fullservice commercial bank in the state of utah and the fourth largest in idaho as measured by domestic deposits and operates in all submarkets in utah and most submarkets in idaho the utah economy is primarily based on the energy agriculture real estate computer technology education health care and financial services sectors during 2013 utah employment grew at a rate of 6 4  compared to the national employment growth rate of 16 this growth decreased utah’s overall unemployment rate to 41 in 2013 from 54 in 2012 in addition the utah state government has been recognized for its policies promoting a businessfriendly climate providing a predictable and stable tax policy and controlling government spending levels see “business segment results” on page 46 for further discussion on the 2013 performance of zions bank 

california’s economy is the largest in the united states representing approximately 13 of the nation’s gdp and is based on a diverse group of business sectors cbt has approximately 11 billion in assets which represent 19 of the company’s assets the state has continued to experience improvements in residential property and cre values increased employment combined with recently approved increases in taxes have resulted in a n estimated 24 billion surplus for the state budget trends in unemployment home foreclosures and bank credit problems continue to improve throughout california resulting in corresponding reductions in problem credits and nonperforming assets at cbt the state’s unemployment rate steadily declined from its peak of 124 in october 2010 to 83 in december 2013 but still remains well above the 67 national   average california’s recovery however has been uneven with coastal areas experiencing much greater gains in employment and housing prices than the interior parts of the state cbt’s primary markets – the coastal and major metropolitan areas in california including the san francisco bay area los angeles county orange county and san diego – continued to experience economic improvements in 2013 compared to 2012 unemployment rates are much lower in cbt’s primary markets compared to the state as a whole see “business segment results” on page 46 for further discussion of the 2013 performance of cbt 

amegy located in texas has 14 billion in assets which represent 24 of the company’s assets texas has a well diversified economy that is the second largest in the united states significant drivers of its growth are the energy health care manufacturing transportation and technology sectors in addition the texas economic environment benefits from businessfriendly growth policies and affordable housing markets these attributes and industry sectors have propelled the texas economy to outperform the nation which has resulted in the unemployment rate declining to 60 compared to the national rate of 67 amegy’s three primary markets houston dallas and san antonio experienced strong job growth in 2013 see “business segment results” on page 46 for further discussion on the 2013 performance of amegy 

keep decisions that affect customers local 

we believe that over the long term ensuring that local management teams retain the authority over many of the decisions affecting their customers is a strategy that ultimately generates optimal growth and profitability in our banking businesses we operate eight different community and regional banks each under a different name and each with its own charter chief executive officer and management team we believe this approach allows us to attract 

and retain exceptional management and provides service of the highest quality to our targeted customers this structure helps ensure that many of the decisions related to customers are made at a local level 

 

the results of this service are evident in the outcome of the greenwich associates annual survey wherein the company consistently receives numerous “excellent” ratings from small and middlemarket businesses 

maintain a sustainable competitive advantage over community banks 

to create a sustainable competitive advantage over other smaller community banks we focus on achieving better product breadth and quality productivity economies of scale availability of liquidity and a lower cost of capital compared to community banks 

 

centralize and standardize policies and oversight of key risks 

we seek to standardize policies and practices related to the management of key risks in order to assure a consistent risk profile in an otherwise decentralized management model among these key risks and functions are credit interest rate liquidity and market risks 

 

management’s overview of 2013 performance 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2013 of 2940 million or 158 per diluted common share compared to 1786 million or 097 per diluted common share for 2012 

while we are encouraged with the 2013 results we strive to further improve our return on equity through improved business operations lower cost of funding and increased revenue

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies further explanations of significant accounting policies are included where applicable in the remaining notes to consolidated financial statements discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the company’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of certain of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

the company measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measures current accounting guidance has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the related life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the company’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are periodically evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available the company would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors certain cdos are valued using an internal model and the assumptions are analyzed for sensitivity “investment securities portfolio” on page 51   provides more information regarding this analysis 

investment securities are reviewed formally on a quarterly basis for the presence of otti the evaluation process takes into account current market conditions the fair value of the security relative to its amortize cost and many other factors the decision to deem these securities otti is based on a specific analysis of the structure of each security and an evaluation of the underlying collateral otti is considered to have occurred if 1 we intend to sell the security 2 it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis the “more likely than not” criteria is a lower threshold than the “probable” criteria

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio but which have not been specifically identified the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses as well as a qualitative review of the results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment and is described in more detail in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the allowance for loan losses plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses   as an example if a total of 15 billion of pass grade loans were to be immediately classified as special mention substandard or doubtful as defined in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the same proportion and in the same loan categories as the existing criticized and classified loans to the whole portfolio the quantitatively determined amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2013 would increase by approximately 63 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in the level of the criticized and classified loans may have on the allowance estimation process 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the allowance for loan losses such factors include but are not limited to national and regional economic trends and indicators we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the allowance for loan losses for the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 65   contain further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the allowance for credit losses 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this annual test as of october 1 of each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit generally one of our subsidiary banks compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired 

to determine the fair value we generally use a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies primarily banks and bank holding companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the company is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the company’s geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium of 25 was appropriate at the most recent test date 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount estimates include economic conditions which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill 

impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the company ’ s regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective october 1 2013 upon completion of the evaluation process we concluded that none of our subsidiary banks was impaired furthermore the evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 18 44 and 13 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100 bps then the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 14 39 and 4 respectively   note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains additional information related to goodwill 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where the company conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

the company had net deferred tax assets “dtas” of 304 million at december 31 2013 compared to 406 million at december 31 2012 the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the allowance for loan losses and 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2013 related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to 1 carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods 2 utilize the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences 3 implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible and 4 generate future taxable income 

after considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits the company has tax reserves at december 31 2013 of approximately 2 million net of federal andor state benefits for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted where applicable the other notes to 

consolidated financial statements and mda discuss new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2013 to the extent they materially affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity   

results of operations 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of 2940 million or 158 per diluted common share for 2013 compared to 1786 million or 097 per diluted common share for 2012 the following changes had a favorable impact on net earnings applicable to common shareholders 

 

the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 in 2012 the company reclassified credit card interchange fee income from interest and fees on loans to other service charges commissions and fees additionally income on factored receivables was reclassified from other service charges commissions and fees to interest and fees on loans there was no change in net earnings for any prior period presented and the reclassification did not significantly impact the company ’ s net interest margin see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2012 of 1786 million or 097 per diluted share compared to 1534 million or 083 per diluted share for 2011 the following changes had a favorable impact on net earnings 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest portion of the company’s revenue for 2013 taxableequivalent net interest income was 17118 million compared to 17502 million and 17764 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all periods presented 

net interest margin in 2013 vs 2012 

the net interest margin was 336 and 357 for 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease resulted primarily from 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following favorable developments 

 even though the company’s average loan portfolio excluding fdicsupported loans was 13 billion higher in 2013 than in 2012 the average interest rate earned on those assets was 42 bps lower this decline in interest income was primarily caused by 1 adjustable rate loans originated in the past resetting to lower rates due to the current repricing index being lower than the rate when the loans were originated and 2 maturing loans many of which had rate floors being replaced with new loans at lower original coupons andor lower floors compared to the rates at which loans were originated when spreads were higher   

the yield earned on afs securities during 2013 was 77 bps lower than in the prior year the yield decline primarily related to lower yields on asset backed securities the fair values of these securities increased during 2013 but the coupon rates stayed the same resulting in lower yields also the interest rates for most of the securities in the afs securities portfolio are based on variable rate indexes such as the 3month libor rate which decreased between these reporting periods 

during 2013 most of the company’s excess liquidity was invested in money market assets primarily deposits with the federal reserve bank average money market investments increased to 173 of total interestearning assets in 2013 compared to 162 in the prior year period the average rate earned on these investments remained essentially unchanged for these time periods 

noninterestbearing demand deposits provided the company with low cost funding and comprised 397 of average total deposits in 2013 compared to 384 in 2012 additionally the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits during 2013 decreased by 8 bps compared to 2012 as a practical matter it is becoming difficult to reduce deposit costs further as these costs approach zero 

during 2013 the company refinanced a portion of its longterm debt by redeeming and repurchasing higher cost debt while issuing new lower cost debt this resulted in a 39 million increase in the average balance of longterm debt the average interest rate paid on longterm debt decreased by 191 bps due to these transactions as well as a reduction in the accelerated amortization of discount related to conversions of subordinated debt to preferred stock refer to the “liquidity management actions” section on page 85 for more information 

net interest margin in 2012 vs 2011 

the net interest margin was 357 and 377 for 2012 and 2011 respectively the 20 bps decrease was primarily caused by 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following favorable developments 

 the company’s average loan portfolio excluding fdicsupported loans was 359 million higher in 2012 than in 

2011 and the average interest rate earned on those assets was 41 bps lower the decline in interest income was primarily caused by 1 adjustable rate loans originated in the past resetting to lower rates due to the current repricing index being lower than the rate when the loans were originated and 2 maturing loans many of which had rate floors being replaced with new loans at lower original coupons andor lower floors compared to the rates at which loans were originated 

during 2012 a large portion of the company’s excess liquidity was invested in money market assets primarily deposits with the federal reserve bank average money market investments increased to 162 of total interestearning assets in 2012 compared to 114 in 2011 the average rate earned by these investments was 027 in 2012 essentially unchanged from 2011 

noninterestbearing demand deposits provided the company with low cost funding and comprised 384 of average total deposits in 2012 compared to 352 in 2011 additionally the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits in 2012 decreased by 18 bps from 2011 

chart 4 illustrates recent trends in the net interest margin and the average federal funds rate 

chart 4   net interest margin 

see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 78 for further discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and the associated risk 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 302 316 and 321 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2013 was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the net interest margin 

we expect the mix of interestearning assets to change over the next several quarters due to planned sales of certain afs cdo securities further decreases in the fdicsupported loan portfolio and slighttomoderate loan growth loan yields are likely to continue to experience downward pressure due to competitive pricing and lower benchmark indices such as libor we believe that some of the downward pressure on the net interest margin will be mitigated by the lower interest expense on longterm debt resulting from the refinancing transactions executed in 2013 we   expect to further reduce interest expense in 2014 through the maturities of debt with relatively high interest costs we also believe we can offset some of the pressure on the net interest margin through loan growth however net interest income is likely to decline over the next year compared to 2013 and the quarterly path may exhibit some volatility 

during 2009 the company executed a subordinated debt modification and exchange transaction the original discount on the convertible subordinated debt was 679 million the remaining discount at december 31 2013 was 42 million which is 187 of the 227 million of remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes it 

included the following components 

 the discount associated with the convertible subordinated debt is amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the remaining term of the subordinated debt referred to herein as “discount amortization” when holders of the convertible subordinated notes convert to preferred stock the rate of amortization is accelerated by immediately expensing any unamortized discount associated with the converted debt referred to herein as “accelerated discount amortization” at december 31 2012 the unamortized discount on the convertible subordinated debt was 149 million or 326 of the 458 million of convertible subordinated notes that were outstanding at that time 

the company expects to remain “assetsensitive” with regard to interest rate risk the current period of low interest rates has lasted for several years during this time the company has maintained an interest rate risk position that is more asset sensitive than it was prior to the economic crisis and it expects to maintain this more assetsensitive position for what may be a prolonged period with interest rates at low levels there is a reduced need to protect against falling interest rates our estimates of the company’s actual interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes in addition our modeled projections for noninterestbearing demand deposits a substantial portion of our deposit balances are particularly reliant on assumptions for which there is little historical experience further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate risk” on page 79

provisions for credit losses 

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various loan portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs credit trends and external factors see note 7   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk 

management” on page 65 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

the provision for loan losses for 2013 was 871 million compared to 142 million and 745 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively during the past few years the company has experienced a significant improvement in credit quality metrics including lower levels of criticized and classified loans and lower realized loss rates in most loan segments however the company continues to exercise caution with regard to the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses given the slow economic recovery at december 31 2013 classified loans were 13 billion compared to 19 billion and 23 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

net loan and lease chargeoffs declined to 52 million in 2013 from 155 million and 456 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively during the fourth quarter of 2013 the annualized ratio of net loan and lease chargeoffs to average loans was 020   see “nonperforming assets” on page 74 and “allowance and reserve for credit losses” on page 77 for further details 

during 2013 the company recorded a 171 million provision for unfunded lending commitments compared to 44 million in 2012 and 93 million in 2011 the overall decrease in the provision from 2012 to 2013 resulted primarily from refinements in the process of estimating the rate at which such commitments are likely to convert into funded balances and from continued improvements in credit quality the decrease was partially offset by an increase in unfunded lending commitments the increase in the provision from 2011 to 2012 was primarily caused by a higher level of unfunded loan commitments which had outpaced improvements in credit quality from period to period the expense related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizeable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations and funding as well as changes in credit quality 

although classified and nonperforming loan volumes continue to be elevated when compared to longterm historical levels most measures of credit quality continued to show improvement during 2013 barring any significant economic downturn we expect the company’s credit costs to remain low for the next several quarters 

a significant portion of net earnings in recent periods is attributable to the reduction in the allowance for credit losses this is primarily attributable to continued reduction in both the quantity of problem loans and the loss severity of such problem loans although we currently expect further reductions in the allowance based on expected improvements in credit quality this source of earnings is not sustainable into perpetuity furthermore a deterioration in economic conditions within our footprint would likely result in net additions to the allowance resulting in a significant change in profitability 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues the company earns for products and services that have no interest rate or yield associated with them for 2013 noninterest income was 3374 million compared to 4199 million in 2012 and 4982 million in 2011 

schedule 4 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years

noninterest income 



other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of atm fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit and credit card interchange fees cash management fees lending commitment fees syndication and servicing fees and other miscellaneous fees increased by 71 million in 2013 compared to 2012 most of the increase can be attributed to higher bankcard merchant and interchange fees in 2013 other service charges commissions and fees included approximately 344 million of debit card interchange fees compared to approximately 325 million in 2012 

other service charges commissions and fees decreased by 115 million in 2012 compared to 2011 most of the decline can be attributed to decreased debit card interchange and atm fees partially offset by growth in credit card interchange fees and loan fees see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the reclassification of fees in prior years 

on june 29 2011 the federal reserve voted to adopt regulations implementing the durbin amendment of the doddfrank act which placed limits on debit card interchange fees charged by banks the durbin amendment became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011 and resulted in a significant decrease in other service charges commissions and fees during 2012 the company’s interchange fees may be adversely affected in the future by the recent ruling of the us district court for the district of columbia which invalidated the federal reserve board’s current regulation of debit card interchange fees the ruling is currently under appeal 

capital markets and foreign exchange income includes trading income public finance fees foreign exchange income and other capital market related fees this revenue remained fairly stable in 2013 when compared to the prior year in 2012 capital markets and foreign exchange income decreased by 46 million from 2011 the decrease was primarily caused by lower income from trading fixed income corporate bonds and decreased foreign exchange income partially offset by higher fees from municipal bond transactions in 2012 in anticipation of the adoption of the volcker rule of the doddfrank act the company discontinued the trading of corporate bonds 

dividends and other investment income consists of revenue from the company’s bankowned life insurance program and revenues from other investments revenues from other investments include dividends on fhlb and 

federal reserve bank stock and earnings from other equity investments including federal agricultural mortgage corporation “famc” and certain alternative venture investments for 2013 this income was 461 million compared to 558 million in 2012 the decrease is mostly caused by lower income from alternative venture investments partially offset by higher earnings from fhlb and famc 

for 2012 dividends and other investment income increased by 316 from 2011 mainly due to higher earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries 

loan sales and servicing income was 353 million for 2013 compared to 400 for the prior year the decrease is mainly caused by decreased income from loan sales partly offset by increased servicing fees in 2013 the company originated fewer mortgages and retained more loans in its portfolio than in 2012 

loan sales and servicing income increased by 119 million in 2012 or 423 compared to 2011 the increase is primarily due to larger gains from loan sales 

fair value and nonhedge derivative loss consists of the following 

schedule 5 

fair value and nonhedge derivative loss 



fair value and nonhedge derivative losses were 36 million lower in 2013 than in 2012 the decreased losses are primarily attributable to changes in fair value on interest rate swaps 

fair value and nonhedge derivative losses were 218 million in 2012 and 50 million in 2011 the increased loss in 2012 was mainly due to higher fees related to the trs agreement and a decrease in income from eurodollar futures used to manage the company’s interest rate risk trs fees were higher in 2012 than in 2011 due to the timing of expense recognition 

during 2013 the company recorded 85 million of equity securities gains compared to 113 million in 2012 and 65 million in 2011 most of the gains recognized in 2013 were generated by sbic investments private equity funds and the sale of other investments in 2012 the equity securities gains were primarily attributable to sbic investments and in 2011 to the sale of bserv inc stock 

fixed income securities losses were 29 million in 2013 compared to gains of 196 million in 2012 and 119 million in 2011 the net loss recorded in 2013 was primarily due to cdo sales while the 2012 and 2011 gains resulted from the company collecting principal payments for cdos that had previously been written down 

the company recognized net impairment losses on investment securities of 1651 million in 2013 1041 million in 2012 and 337 million in 2011 see “investment securities portfolio” on page 51 for additional information 

other noninterest income was 179 million in 2013 compared to 131 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to gains related to certain loans which had been purchased from failed banks covered by fdic losssharing agreements as well as gains from branch deposit and asset sales other noninterest income was 296 million in 2011 which included payments from the fdic related to certain acquired loans that had been determined to be covered by loss sharing agreements 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense increased by 74 to 17144 million in 2013 compared to 2012 during 2013 the company refinanced a considerable portion of its longterm debt and incurred debt extinguishment costs the company also continued to make significant progress in resolving problem loans and improving the credit quality of its loan portfolio which resulted in substantially lower other real estate and creditrelated expenses 

schedule 6 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

schedule 6 

noninterest expense 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 31 during 2013 most of the increase can be attributed to higher base salaries and bonuses which were partially offset by decreased sharebased compensation and lower retirement expense 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 13 during 2012 salary expense for 2012 included sharebased compensation expense of 315 million compared to 290 million in 2011 bonus and incentive expenses were lower in 2012 than in 2011 because certain longterm incentive compensation plans were no longer expected to pay out or to pay out at a reduced amount 

salaries and employee benefits are shown in greater detail in schedule 7 

schedule 7 

salaries and employee benefits 



other real estate expense decreased 913 in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease is primarily due to lower writedowns of oreo values during workout and lower holding expenses partially offset by decreased gains from property sales oreo balances declined by 530 during the last 12 months mostly due to a reduction in oreo properties 

other real estate expense decreased in 2012 by 746 from 2011 the decrease was primarily due to a 359 reduction in oreo balances from 2011 to 2012 which resulted in reduced holding expenses as well as lower writedowns of property carrying values 

creditrelated expense includes costs incurred during the foreclosure process prior to the company obtaining title to collateral and recording an asset in oreo as well as other outofpocket costs related to the management of problem loans and other assets during 2013 and 2012 creditrelated expense was 336 million and 505 million respectively the decrease in 2013 is primarily attributable to lower foreclosure costs and legal expenses additionally the levels of problem credits have decreased from 2012 credit related expense in 2012 was 180 lower than in 2011 the decline was primarily attributable to lower property tax and legal costs incurred during workout 

professional and legal services were 680 million in 2013 compared to 525 million in 2012 most of the increase is attributed to higher consulting expenses related to the company’s upgrade of its stress testing and capital planning capabilities and processes to meet ccar standards and to consulting fees related to projects to replace andor upgrade its core loan deposit and accounting systems 

professional and legal services were 135 million higher in 2012 than in 2011 the increase was mostly due to regulatory legal and contractual matters 

fdic premiums decreased in 2013 by 124 to 380 million most of the decrease was due to improved credit quality of the company’s loan portfolio fdic premiums recorded during 2012 declined by 321 from 2011 the decrease in 2012 resulted from the combination of a change in the premium assessment formulas prescribed by the fdic and improved risk factors employed in those formulas 

in 2013 the company incurred 1202 million of debt extinguishment cost due the extinguishment of several longterm debt instruments discussed in note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements no such expenses were incurred in 2012 or 2011 

other noninterest expense for 2013 was 3004 million compared to 2752 million in 2012 the increase is mostly the result of increased writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset the balance of fdic supported loans has declined significantly during 2013 primarily due to paydowns and payoffs 

other noninterest expense decreased by 108 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the decline was primarily the result of lower writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset due to better than expected performance of fdicsupported loans other noninterest expense in 2012 included 10 million of goodwill impairment 

foreign operations 

zions bank and amegy operate branches in grand cayman grand cayman islands bwi the foreign branches only accept deposits from qualified domestic customers while deposits in these branches are not subject to frb reserve requirements there are no federal or state income tax benefits to the company or any customers as a result of these operations 

foreign deposits at december 31 2013 and 2012 were 20 billion and 18 billion respectively and averaged 17 billion in 2013 and 15 billion in 2012 foreign deposits are related to domestic customers of our subsidiary banks 

income taxes 

the company’s income tax expense was 1430 million in 2013 1934 million in 2012 and 1986 million in 2011 the company’s effective income tax rates including the effects of noncontrolling interests were 351 in 2013 356 in 2012 and 380 in 2011 the tax expense rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance these rate reductions were mostly offset by the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock however in 2011 the amount of the nondeductible amortization from conversions of subordinated debt to preferred stock was significantly higher than the amounts in 2013 and 2012 increasing the tax rate for 2011 

as discussed in previous filings the company has received federal income tax credits under the us government’s community development financial institutions fund that are recognized over a sevenyear period from the year of investment the effect of these tax credits provided an income tax benefit of 06 million in 2013 12 million in 2012 and 24 million in 2011 

the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of approximately 304 million at december 31 2013 compared to 406 million at december 31 2012 the decrease in the net deferred tax asset resulted primarily from items related to loan chargeoffs in excess of loan loss provisions fair value adjustments on securities reduction in net operating and capital loss carryforwards and oreo the net decrease in deferred tax assets was partially offset by a decrease in the deferred tax liabilities related to premises and equipment fdicsupported transactions and the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock the company did not record any additional valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2013 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 30   for additional information

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases 

schedule 2  which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of the company’s interest earning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another 

goal is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets such as money market investments or securities while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets the current period of slow economic growth accompanied by the moderate loan demand experienced in recent quarters has made it difficult to achieve these goals 

average interestearning assets were 510 billion in 2013 compared to 490 billion in the previous year average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 928 in 2013 and 920 in 2012 

average loans including fdicsupported loans were 381 billion in 2013 and 370 billion in 2012 average loans as a percentage of total average assets was 694 in 2013 compared to 695 in 2012 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and security resell agreements increased by 116 to 88 billion in 2013 compared to 79 billion in 2012 average securities increased by 15 from 2012 average total deposits increased by 43 while average total loans increased by 29 for 2013 when compared to 2012 increased deposits combined with moderate loan growth resulted in higher balances of excess cash that was deployed in money market investments

investment securities portfolio 

we invest in securities to generate revenues for the company portions of the portfolio are also available as a source of liquidity schedule 9 presents a profile of the company’s investment securities portfolio the amortized cost amounts represent the company’s original cost of the investments adjusted for related accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments and for impairment losses including creditrelated impairment the estimated fair value measurement levels and methodology are discussed in detail in note 21   of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have included selected credit rating information for certain of the investment securities schedules because this information is one indication of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed and significant declines in ratings for our investment portfolio could indicate an increased level of risk for the company 

schedule 9 

investment securities portfolio 

the amortized cost of investment securities on december 31 2013 increased by 14 from the balances on december 31 2012 primarily due to increases in agency securities small business administration loanbacked securities and mutual funds partially offset by decreased investments in trust preferred and other assetbacked securities us treasury securities and agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities 

the amortized cost of investment securities on december 31 2012 decreased by 87 from the balances on december 31 2011 primarily due to reductions in agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities reductions and impairment of assetbacked securities partially offset by increased investments in us treasury securities and mutual funds and other securities 

as of december 31 2013 70 of the 37 billion fair value of availableforsale “afs” securities portfolio was valued at level 1 577 was valued at level 2 and 353 was valued at level 3 under the gaap fair value accounting valuation hierarchy at december 31 2012 104 of the 31 billion fair value of afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 571 was valued at level 2 and 325 was valued at level 3 

the amortized cost of afs investment securities valued at level 3 was 1574 million at december 31 2013 and the fair value of these securities was 1305 million the securities valued at level 3 were comprised of abs cdos primarily bank and insurance company trust preferred cdos and municipal securities for these level 3 securities net pretax unrealized loss recognized in oci at december 31 2013 was 269 million as of december 

31 2013 we believe that we will receive on settlement or maturity at least the amortized cost   amounts of the level 3 afs securities this expectation applies to both those securities for which otti has been recognized and those for which no otti has been recognized 

estimated fair value determined under asc 820 precludes the use of “blockage factors” or liquidity adjustments due to the quantity of securities held by the company the company’s ability to sell in a short period of time a substantial portion of its cdo securities at the indicated estimated fair values particularly those valued under level 3 is highly dependent upon then current market conditions the market for such securities which showed substantial improvement in late 2013 remains difficult to predict in general the company believes that sales of large quantities of those securities has the potential to lower the prices received however the company sold 282 million amortized cost of these cdos in january and february 2014 into an improving market without a noticeable adverse impact on pricing please refer to notes 6 and 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

significant assumption changes for 2013 

there were significant changes to the assumptions used in the model during 2013 the reduction in discount rates was the most significant change compared to 2012 

the company uses unobservable assumptions including collateral default rates and prepayment rates to produce pool level cash flows for each cdo pool level cash flows are allocated to each security issued by the cdo in accordance with the cdo’s provisions producing a best estimate of each cdo security’s cash flows to identify a fair value for each security the company must then discount the best estimate cash flow for a security using a market level discount rate the company identifies the appropriate market level discount rate for each security by utilizing market observable trade information available for some of the securities 

in 2013 the company observed increased prices in market trades and incorporated these observations into the discount rate assumptions used to calculate fair value this trade information included sales of cdo securities by the company both before and after the publication of the volcker rule accordingly the fair value of the company’s cdo portfolio also increased in 2013 consistent with observable cdo trades 

probability of default of deferring bank holding company trust preferred collateral 

historically our ratiobased valuation model assessed both performing and deferring issuers ratios predictive of bank failure were used in our model to identify the pd of bank holding company issuers of trust preferred securities for deferring collateral our ratio based approach includes a “time in deferral” variable which assesses higher pds as issuers near the end of their allowable deferral period of 20 quarters for more information about the model please refer to note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effective september 30 2013 our weighted average loss assumption for deferrals was 66 compared to 55 as of june 30 2013 updated as of december 31 2013 the weighted average loss assumption on remaining deferrals was 75 some of this percentage increase is a result of selection bias as healthier deferring issuers reperform and come current on past interest they are removed from the deferring bank pool for modeling purposes the overall collateral pool to which the company is exposed remains unchanged but the deferring collateral pool becomes smaller and consists increasingly of weaker banks at december 31 2013 76 of deferring issuers were subject to regulatory orders precluding payment nonetheless 60 of these deferring issuers were both profitable and “well capitalized” under regulatory capital regulations 

assumption changes regarding prepayment rate 

since the third quarter of 2010 as a result of the doddfrank act we have assumed that large banks with investment grade ratings will fully prepay their trust preferred securities by the end of 2015 the doddfrank act phases in by yearend 2015 the disallowance of the inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier 1 capital for banks with assets over 15 billion “large banks” for those large institutions within each pool with investment grade ratings we assume that trust preferred securities will be called prior to the end of the disallowance period the pace of these large bank prepayments to date has generally been consistent with our assumption 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company increased the prepayment assumptions for small banks because of the extent of observed prepayments made by these types of banks the prepayment rate assumption for small banks was increased from 3 per year for each year to 10 per year for three years and 3 thereafter the company expected a few years of this higher prepayment rate as a result of proposed regulations that would disallow over a phasein period the inclusion of trust preferred as tier 1 capital by small banks as well as continued economic driven capital restructuring and industry consolidation we changed this assumption because our cdo pools experienced significant and increasing prepayments of small bank trust preferred securities during the latter part of 2012 we define “small banks” as collateral that is not subject to the phasedin disallowance of bank trust preferred securities as tier 1 capital required by the doddfrank act the majority of which would be subject to a more lengthy phasedin disallowance under capital rules proposed by the federal reserve and other banking regulators these are primarily banks with assets below 15 billion 

observed prepayments by small banks in our cdo pools during 2013 were significantly less than the 10 per year assumed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the proposed phaseout of trust preferred by small banks was not included in the final regulations this led us to reduce the assumed prepayment rate to 9 in the second quarter of 2013 to 75 in the third quarter of 2013 and to 55 in the fourth quarter of 2013 

given the 55 small bank prepayment rate assumption until the end of 2015 and 3 thereafter and the differing extent of large banks remaining in cdo pools the pool specific prepayment rate until the end of 2015 is calculated with reference to both a the percentage of each pool’s performing collateral consisting of small banks as well as b the percentage which consists of collateral from large banks with investment grade ratings after 2015 each pool is assumed to prepay at a 3 annual rate 

for the fourth quarter of 2013 the resulting average annual prepayment rate assumption for pools which includes both large and small banks is 12 for each year through 2015 followed by an annual prepayment rate assumption of 3 thereafter for pools without large banks we assume a 55 annual prepayment rate for each year through 2015 and 3 thereafter increased prepayment rates are generally favorable for the fair value of the most senior tranches and adverse to the fair value of the more junior tranches the small bank prepayment assumption changes were not material to either fair values or credit impairment during 2013 

valuation sensitivity of level 3 bank and insurance cdos 

schedule 12 sets forth the sensitivity of the current internally modeled cdos ’  fair values to changes in the most significant assumptions utilized in the model 

schedule 12 

sensitivity of internal model 



1 the company uses an incurred credit loss model which specifies cumulative losses at the 1year 5year and 30year points from the date of valuation these current and projected losses are reflected in the cdo’s fair value 

 3 the discount rate is a spread over the forward libor curve at the date of valuation 

4 percentage increase is applied to incremental projected loss percentages from currently performing collateral for example the 50 and 100 stress scenarios for afs securities would result in cumulative 30year losses of 405  34450 0319100 and 466  344100 0319100 respectively 

5 prepayment rate for small banks increased to 65 per year for the first two years and to 4 per year thereafter through maturity 

 56 

during the year the market level discount rates applicable to bank and insurance cdos declined substantially and fair values rose the discount rate or credit spread in the above 2013 sensitivity analysis of valuation assumptions is approximately 300 bps lower than that used in 2012 trade data supported the extent of fair value increases through the year in addition the portfolio’s fair value exhibited greater sensitivity to loss assumptions on performing collateral than was the case in 2012 the portion of bank collateral performing at the end of 2013 has increased as the rate of reperfomance by deferring issuers outpaced the rate of prepayment during 2013 

bank collateral deferral experience 

the company’s loss and recovery experience on defaults as of december 31 2013 and our level 3 modeling assumption is essentially a 100 loss on defaulted bank collateral in cdos although we have to date received several generally small recoveries on a few defaults securities sales during 2013 resulted in the company reducing its exposure to some unresolved deferring banks for the remaining deferring banks our cumulative experience to date with bank collateral in its first deferral cycle has been that 53 has defaulted 29 has reperformed and approximately 18 remains within the allowable deferral period at december 31 2013 the company had exposure to 131 deferring issuers of which 123 were in their initial deferral period and eight were redeferrals late 2012 events led the company to increase its loss assumptions on deferrals most of which were more than halfway through their allowable deferral period we expected then and continue to expect that future losses on these deferrals may result from actions other than bank failures – primarily holding company bankruptcies and debt restructurings 

a significant number of previous deferrals have resumed interest payments 117 issuing banks with collateral aggregating to 29 of all deferrals to which we have exposure have either come current and resumed interest payments on their trust preferred securities or have announced they intend to do so at the next payment date banks may come current on their trust preferred securities for one or more quarters and then redefer such redeferral has occurred in eight of the 131 banks that are currently deferring further information on the company’s valuation process is detailed in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedules 13 and 14 provide additional information on the belowinvestmentgrade rated bank and insurance trust preferred cdos’ portions of the afs and htm portfolios the schedules reflect data and assumptions that are included in the calculations of fair value and otti the schedules utilize the lowest rating assigned by any rating agency to identify those securities below investment grade the schedules segment the securities by whether or not they have been determined to have creditrelated otti and by original ratings level to provide granularity on the seniority level of the securities and the distribution of unrealized losses a few insurance cdo securities with no creditrelated otti had otti in the fourth quarter due to the company’s intent to sell them because they became prohibited investments as a result of the volcker rule the best and worst poollevel statistic for each original ratings subgroup is presented not the best and worst single security within the original ratings grouping the number of issuers and the number of currently performing issuers noted in schedule 14 are from the same security the remaining statistics may not be from the same security

5  utilizes the company’s loss assumption of 100 on defaulted collateral and the company’s issuerspecific loss assumption ranging from 218 to 100 dependent on credit for each deferring piece of collateral “collateralization” in the schedule identifies the portion of a cdo tranche that is backed by nondefaulted collateral the numerator is all collateral less the sum of i 100 of the defaulted collateral ii the sum of the projected net loss amounts for each piece of deferring but not defaulted collateral and iii the amount of each cdo’s debt which is senior to our security’s priority level the denominator is the par amount of the tranche par is defined as the original par less any principal paydowns

otherthantemporary impairment – investments in debt securities 

we review investments in debt securities each quarter for the presence of otti for securities for which an internal incomebased cash flow model or third party valuation service produces a lossadjusted expected cash flow for the security the presence of otti is identified and the amount of the credit component of otti is calculated by discounting this lossadjusted cash flow at the securityspecific effective interest rate and comparing that value to the company’s amortized cost of the security 

we review the relevant facts and circumstances each quarter to assess our intentions regarding any potential sales of securities as well as the likelihood that we would be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost for afs securities and prior to maturity for htm securities prior to the fourth quarter of 2013 for each afs security whose fair value was below amortized cost we had determined that we did not intend to sell the security and that it was not more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis   prior to the fourth quarter of 2013 for each htm security whose fair value was below amortized cost we had determined that it was not more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before maturity 

as a result of the volcker rule ifr and the company’s decision to reduce its risk profile the company changed its determination with respect to certain of its securities the result was a pretax securities impairment charge of 137 million on these securities approximately one third of the charge relates to securities that the company determined to sell during the first quarter of 2014 and which the volcker rule and the ifr precluded the company from holding beyond july 21 2015 by which time the company does not expect to have recovered its amortized cost the remaining two thirds of the charge relates to securities that the company determined to sell during the first quarter of 2014 despite each being allowable under the volcker rule and the ifr 

additionally creditrelated impairment of 5 million was identified in the fourth quarter of 2013 in securities that we do not intend to sell we evaluate the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of each security and identify if any of the difference is due to credit the credit component of the difference is recognized by writing down the amortized cost of each security found to have otti 

for some cdo tranches we do not intend to sell which have previously recorded otti expected future cash flows have remained stable or have slightly improved subsequent to the quarter that otti was identified and recorded for other cdo tranches an adverse change in the expected future cash flow has resulted in the recording of additional otti in both situations while a difference may remain between fair value and amortized cost the difference is not due to credit the expected future cash flow substantiates the return of the full amortized cost we utilize a present value technique to both identify the otti existing in the cdo tranches and to estimate fair value the primary drivers of unrealized losses in these cdos are further discussed in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during 2013 the company recognized total otti on cdos of 1651 million compared to 1041 million in 2012 schedule 16   identifies the sources of otti

the company has only de minimus credit exposure to foreign sovereign risks and does not believe its total foreign credit exposure is material in the normal course of business the company may enter into transactions with subsidiaries of companies and financial institutions headquartered in foreign countries such transactions may include deposits loans letters of credit and derivatives as well as foreign currency exchange agreements as of december 31 2013 these transactions did not present any material direct or indirect risk exposure to the company among the derivative transactions the company has a trs agreement with deutsche bank ag “db” with regard to certain bank and insurance trust preferred cdos see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the trs if db were unable to perform under the trs the agreement would terminate at little or no cost to the company there would be only an immaterial balance sheet impact from cancellation and the company would save approximately 54 million in quarterly fees however if the trs were canceled the company would lose the potential future risk mitigation benefits of the trs and as of december 31 2013 regulatory risk weighted assets under the basel i framework would increase by approximately 24 billion and riskbased capital ratios would be reduced by approximately 5 deducting the trs securities included in the cdo sales completed in january and february 2014 see “subsequent event” on a pro forma basis the increase in risk weighted assets would be approximately 13 billion and riskbased capital ratios would be reduced by approximately 2 to 3 eg a risk based ratio of 100 would decline to approximately 98 to 97 

loans held for sale 

loans held for sale consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market were 171 million at december 31 2013 compared to 252 million at december 31 2012 consumer loans are primarily fixed rate mortgages that are originated and sold to third parties 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2013 net loans and leases accounted for 697 of total assets compared to 679 at the end of 2012 schedule 19 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2013 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in a small number of cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 79 

schedule 19 

loan portfolio by type and maturity 

as of december 31 2013 net loans and leases were 390 billion reflecting a 37 increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations as well as a decrease in paydowns and chargeoffs of existing loans 

most of the loan portfolio growth during 2013 occurred in   commercial and industrial 14 family residential and commercial real estate construction and land development loans the impact of these increases was partially offset by declines in fdicsupported commercial owner occupied and commercial real estate term loans the loan portfolio increased primarily at amegy cbt and nsb while balances declined at zions bank 

commercial and industrial 14 family residential and commercial real estate construction and land development loan balances grew in part due to reduced volume of prepayments commercial owner occupied loans declined mostly due to strategic runoff and attrition of the national real estate loan portfolio at zions bank   we expect commercial real estate construction and land development loan balances to increase at a modest rate in 2014 the balance of fdicsupported loans declined mainly due to paydowns and payoffs and the fact that the company has not purchased additional loans with fdic loss sharing coverage since 2009 in 2014 the fdicsupported loan loss share agreements will expire with the exception of coverage for a small amount of residential mortgage loans see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fdicsupported loans and loss share agreements 

loans serviced for the benefit of others amounted to approximately 27   billion and 26 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

foreign loans consist primarily of commercial and industrial loans and totaled 43   million and 99 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively

deposits 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company average total deposits increased by 43 during 2013 with average interestbearing deposits increasing by 22 and average noninterestbearing deposits increasing 78 the increase in noninterestbearing deposits was largely driven by increased deposits from business customers the average interest rate paid for interest bearing deposits was 8 bps lower in 2013 than in 2012 

core deposits at december 31 2013 which exclude time deposits larger than 100000 and brokered deposits increased by 10 or 432 million from december 31 2012 the increase was mainly due to increases in noninterestbearing and interestbearing demand deposits foreign deposits and savings accounts partially offset by decreased money market accounts and time deposits 

demand and savings and money market deposits comprised 901 of total deposits at december 31 2013 compared with 897 at december 31 2012 

during 2013 and 2012 the company maintained a low level of brokered deposits with the primary purpose of keeping that funding source available in case of a future need at december 31 2013 total deposits included 29 million of brokered deposits compared to 37 million at december 31 2012

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit administration and credit examination functions at the parent we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to management and to the risk oversight committee of the board of directors new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the corporate new product review committee 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each subsidiary bank can be more conservative in its operations under the corporate credit policy however formal corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to invoke a more liberal policy historically there have been only a limited number of such approvals this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

credit risk associated with counterparties to offbalance sheet credit instruments is generally limited to the hedging of interest rate risk through the use of swaps and futures our subsidiary banks that engage in this activity have isda agreements in place under which derivative transactions are entered into with major derivative dealers each isda agreement details the collateral arrangements between our subsidiary banks and their counterparties in every case the amount of the collateral required to secure the exposed party in the derivative transaction is determined by the fair value of the derivative and the credit rating of the party with the obligation some of the counterparties are domiciled in europe however the company’s maximum exposure that is not cash collateralized to any single counterparty was not material as of december 31 2013 

the company’s credit risk management strategy includes diversification of its loan portfolio the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty the company has adopted and adheres to concentration limits on various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending leveraged lending municipal lending and lending to the energy sector all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary these concentration limits particularly with regard to various categories of cre and real estate development are materially lower than they were in 2007 and 2008 just prior to the emergence of the recent economic downturn the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers located within the geographical footprint of its subsidiary banks 

the credit quality of the company’s loan portfolio improved during 2013 nonperforming lendingrelated assets at december 31 2013 decreased by 393 from december 31 2012 gross chargeoffs for 2013 declined to 131 million from 267 million in 2012 net chargeoffs decreased to 52 million from 155 million for the same periods 

as displayed in schedule 21 commercial and industrial loans were the largest category and constituted 320 of the company’s loan portfolio at december 31 2013 construction and land development loans slightly increased to 56 of total loans at december 31 2013 compared to 51 at december 31 2012 however they have declined significantly from a prerecession level of 201 of total loans at the end of 2007

fdicsupported loans 

the company’s loan portfolio includes loans that were acquired from failed banks in 2009 alliance bank great basin bank and vineyard bank these loans include nonperforming loans and other loans with characteristics indicative of a high credit risk profile substantially all of these loans are covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic for which the fdic generally will assume 80 of the first 275 million of credit losses for the alliance bank assets 40 million of credit losses for the great basin bank assets 465 million of credit losses for the vineyard bank assets and 95 of the credit losses in excess of those amounts the company does not expect total losses to exceed this higher threshold because acquired loans have performed better than originally expected fdicsupported loans represented 09 and 14 of the company’s total loan portfolio at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively refer to note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

approximately 17 of the cre term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2013 for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to seven years the remaining 83 of cre loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include for example criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project loantovalue ratio and occupancy rates   

approximately 18 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2013 consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected cash flows of the project are key in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily projects we look for substantial preleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 or higher depending on the project asset class 

within the residential construction and development sector many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity principal curtailment requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan heavy consideration is given to market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered and validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower generally by each bank’s internal appraisal review function which is staffed by licensed appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used appraisals are ordered from outside appraisers at the inception renewal or for cre loans upon the occurrence of any event causing a downgrade to a “criticized” or “classified” designation the frequency for obtaining updated appraisals for these adversely graded credits is increased when declining market conditions exist 

advance rates will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but the company’s guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and spec homes and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally loanbyloan reviews of pass grade loans for all commercial and residential construction and land development loans are performed semiannually at amegy cbt nbaz nsb vectra and zions bank tcbo and tcbw perform such reviews annually 

interest reserves are generally established as a loan disbursement budget item for real estate construction or development loans we generally require borrowers to put their equity into the project prior to loan disbursements on these loans this enables the bank to ensure the availability of equity to complete the project the company’s practice is to monitor the construction sales andor leasing progress to determine whether or not the project remains viable if at any time during the life of the credit the project is determined not to be viable including the adequacy of the remaining interest reserves the bank takes appropriate action to protect its collateral position via negotiation andor legal action as deemed necessary at december 31 2013 and 2012 zions’ affiliates had 609 and 451 loans with an outstanding balance of 715 million and 477 million where available interest reserves amounted to 104 million and 73 million respectively in instances where projects are in default and have been determined not to be 

viable the interest reserves and other disbursements have been frozen as appropriate 

we have not been involved to any meaningful extent with insurance arrangements credit derivatives or any other default agreements as a mitigation strategy for cre loans however we do make use of personal or other guarantees as risk mitigation strategies 

cre loans are sometimes modified to increase the likelihood of collecting the maximum possible amount of the company’s investment in the loan in general the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing a loan for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes into consideration this repayment source 

additionally when we modify or extend a loan we give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether a concession has been granted in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists however if additional collateral is obtained or if a strong guarantor exists who is believed to be able and willing to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

in general we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation performance of other related projects with which we are familiar and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance the company estimates previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if at any point in time there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared to the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

consumer loans 

the company has mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality its practice historically has been to sell “conforming” fixed rate loans to third parties including fannie mae and freddie mac for which it makes representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards it has also been the company’s practice historically to hold variable rate loans in its portfolio the company estimates that it does not have any material financial risk as a result of either its 

foreclosure practices or loan “putbacks” by fannie mae or freddie mac and has not established any reserves related to these items 

the company has a portfolio of 276 million of stated income mortgage loans with generally high fico® scores at origination including “onetime close” loans to finance the construction of homes which convert into permanent jumbo mortgages as of december 31 2013 approximately 18 million of these loans had refreshed fico® scores of less than 620 these totals exclude heldforsale loans stated income loans account for approximately 06 million or 10 of our credit losses in 14 family residential first mortgage loans during 2013 most of the net credit losses were incurred by nbaz while zions bank had net recoveries on stated income loans that had been previously written off 

the company is engaged in home equity credit line “hecl” lending at december 31 2013 the company’s hecl portfolio totaled 21 billion including fdicsupported loans approximately 11 billion of the portfolio is secured by first deeds of trust while the remaining 10 billion is secured by junior liens the outstanding balances and commitments by origination year for the junior lien hecls are presented in schedule 27 

schedule 27 

jr lien hecls – outstanding balances and total commitments 



more than 97 of the company’s hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 41 is scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years however most of the loans are expected to be renewed for a second 10year period after a satisfactory review of the borrower’s credit history and ability to repay the loan of the total home equity credit line portfolio including fdicsupported loans 018 was 90 days or more past due at december 31 2013 compared to 027 at december 31 2012 during 2013 the company modified 01 million of home equity credit lines the annualized credit losses for the hecl portfolio were 23 bps and 86 bps for 2013 and 2012 respectively 

as of december 31 2013 loans representing approximately 7 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateral value the estimated current collateral value is based on projecting values forward from the most recent valuation of the underlying collateral using home price indices at the metropolitan area level generally a valuation of collateral is performed at origination for junior lien hecls the estimated current balance of prior liens is added to the numerator in the calculation of cltv additional detail for the cltv as of december 31 2013 and 2012 is shown in schedule 28 

schedule 28 

hecl portfolio by combined loantovalue 



at origination underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination credit bureau data credit scores and estimated cltv are refreshed on a quarterly basis and are used to monitor and manage accounts including amounts available under the lines of credit the allowance for loan losses is determined through the use of roll rate models and first lien hecls are modeled separately from junior lien hecls see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the allowance for loan losses 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming lendingrelated assets as a percentage of loans and leases and oreo decreased to 115 at december 31 2013 compared with 196 at december 31 2012 

total nonaccrual loans excluding fdicsupported loans at december 31 2013 decreased by 229 million from the prior year the decrease is primarily due to a 79 million decrease in construction and land development loans a 70 million decrease in commercial owner occupied loans and a 65 million decrease in commercial real estate term loans the largest total decreases in nonaccrual loans occurred at zions bank amegy and nsb 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” on page 76 for more information company policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to commercial real estate term loans see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

restructured loans 

tdrs are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties and for which the company has granted a concession that it would not otherwise consider commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such consumer loan tdrs may include firstlien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 

for certain tdrs we split the loan into two new notes – an “a” note and a “b” note the a note is structured to comply with our current lending standards at current market rates and is tailored to suit the customer’s ability to make timely principal and interest payments the b note includes the granting of the concession to the borrower and varies by situation we may defer principal and interest payments until the a note has been paid in full at the time of restructuring the a note is identified and classified as a tdr the b note is chargedoff but the obligation is not forgiven to the borrower and any payments collected on the b notes are accounted for as recoveries the outstanding carrying value of loans restructured using the ab note strategy was approximately 126 million and 160 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that the company is reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether or not a loan should be returned to accrual status

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 



in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure company policy requires that the removal of tdr status be approved at the same management level that approved the upgrading of a loan’s classification see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs

allowance and reserve for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

schedule 32 shows the changes in the allowance for loan losses and a summary of loan loss experience

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 



the total alll declined during 2013 by 150 million due to the positive credit trends experienced in our major loan portfolio segments although credit quality trends improved during 2013 the company increased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to keep changes in the level of alll consistent with continued elevated levels of problem loans and moderate economic growth 

the total alll at december 31 2012 decreased by 156 million compared to december 31 2011 the decreases in the alll reflected improvements in credit quality trends and somewhat improving economic conditions in some of our markets the company decreased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to reflect the positive credit quality trends and stabilizing economic conditions 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is separately shown in the company’s balance sheet and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are shown separately in the statement of income the reserve decreased by 171 million compared to december 31 2012   

see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses and credit trends experienced in each portfolio segment 

interest rate and market risk management   

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company including interest rate and market risk management the boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews limit exceptions reported by management the board has established the assetliability committee “alco” consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the company among its other responsibilities alco’s primary responsibility for managing interest rate and market risk includes the following 

 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have the net interest margin increase slightly in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being slightly “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise the asset sensitivity of the company’s balance sheet changed minimally during 2013 

due to the low level of rates and the natural lower bound of zero for market indices there is limited sensitivity to falling rates at the current time however if interest rates remain at their current historically low levels given the company’s asset sensitivity it expects its net interest margin to be under continuing modest pressure assuming a stable balance sheet if interest rates remain stable this pressure may lead to a reduction in net interest income unless its impact is offset by sufficient loan growth interest rate swaps securities purchases or other means 

we attempt to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income primarily through the use of interest rate floors on variable rate loans interest rate swaps interest rate futures and by avoiding large exposures to longterm fixed rate interestearning assets that have significant negative convexity our earning assets are largely tied to the shorter end of the interest rate curve the prime lending rate and the libor curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods market value of equity “mve” and income simulation in the mve method we measure the expected changes in the fair values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the income simulation method we analyze the expected changes in income in response to changes in interest rates 

mve is calculated as the fair value of all assets and derivative instruments minus the fair value of liabilities we report changes in the dollar amount of mve for parallel shifts in interest rates 

due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in mve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney caps on loans which have 

little effect for small rate movements but may become important if larger rate shocks were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for low rate mortgages in a higher rate environment 

the company’s policy is generally to limit declines in mve to 3 per 100 bps movement in interest rates in either direction schedule 34 presents the formal limits adopted by the company ’ s board of directors 

schedule 34 

market value of equity decline limits 



these mve limits adopted in late 2012 are a change from the previous policy which imposed limits on duration of equity we had been calculating both measures in parallel for several quarters prior to the adoption of mve as a primary policy limit and no significant change in the company’s interest rate risk position resulted from this policy change further we still calculate and monitor both measures duration of equity measures changes in mve for small changes in interest rates only the changes to the policy to limit declines in mve over a wider range of rate movements enhanced the interest rate risk management practice of the company changes or exceptions to the mve limits are subject to notification and approval by the risk oversight committee of the company’s board of directors 

income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income and total rate sensitive income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income and total rate sensitive income are measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio for income simulation company policy requires that interest sensitive income from a static balance sheet be limited to a decline of no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps 

each of these measurement methods requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of mve and income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is actively managed to maintain an assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

the estimated mve and income simulation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking and savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these estimates we view both the mve and the income simulation results as falling within a wide range of possibilities management uses historical regression analysis as a guide to setting such assumptions however due to the current low interest rate environment which has little historical precedent estimated deposit durations may not reflect actual future results even modest variation of such assumptions may have significant impact on the calculation of income simulation and market value of equity shown below these assumptions are as follows

repricing scenario assumptions by deposit product 



note effective duration measures the percent change in mve for a 100 bps parallel shift in rates as compared to the macaulay duration which measures weighted average life of cash flows in years and is not reported the company’s demand deposit model assumes significant negative convexity in the current low rate environment 

as of the dates indicated the following schedule shows the company’s percentage change in interest rate sensitive income based on a static balance sheet in the first year after the rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 100 bps to 300 bps the company estimates interest rate risk with two sets of deposit repricing scenarios 

the first scenario assumes that administeredrate deposits money market interestearning checking and savings reprice at a faster speed in response to changes in interest rates additionally interest rates cannot decline below zero at december 31 2013 and 2012 interest rates were at such a low level that repricing scenarios assuming 100 bps rate shocks produced negative results 

the second scenario assumes that those deposits reprice at a slower speed for larger rate shocks eg 300 bps models reflecting consumer behavior in regards to both loan prepayments and deposit runoff are inherently prone to increased model uncertainty

income simulation – change in interest rate sensitive income 





schedule 37 includes changes in the mve from 100 bps to 300 bps parallel rate moves for both “fast” and “slow” scenarios 

schedule 37 

changes in market value of equity 



note the major change in mve is due to the assumption change in noncore dda6m vs 1m  



during 2013 changes in interest rate sensitivity were among other things driven by 

 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 78 and 77 respectively of the company’s commercial lending and cre portfolios were variable rate and primarily tied to either the prime rate or   libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have variable interest rates see schedule 19 for further information on fixed and variable interest rates of the loan portfolio 

largely due to competitive pressures the favorable impact on loan yield from the use of interest rate floors has diminished as of december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 394   and 375 respectively of all of the company’s variable rate loan balances contain floors of the loans with floors approximately 645 and   744  of the balances at these same respective dates were priced at the floor rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 053    and 107 respectively 

at december 31 2013 the company held 100 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements of which 50 million each mature in 2018 and 2019 see notes 8 and 21   of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

market risk – fixed income 

the company engages in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2013 the company had 35 million of trading assets and 74 million of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 28 million and 27 million respectively at december 31 2012 

during the third quarter of 2012 the company exited the business of trading corporate debt securities in preparation for the expected implementation of the volcker rule of the doddfrank act we do not expect this change to have a material impact on the company’s future earnings 

the company is exposed to market risk through changes in fair value the company is also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2013 the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs and htm securities was an increase of 235 million compared to a 149 million increase in 2012 the primary reason for the increase is the observed improvement in market values of trust preferred cdos and such improvements may not be sustainable if any of the afs or htm securities become otherthantemporarily impaired the credit impairment is charged to operations see “investment securities portfolio” on page 51 for additional information on otti 

market risk – equity investments 

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded in addition the company owns equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and federal home loan banks that are not publicly traded and which are accounted for under cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since the fair value of these securities may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

the company holds investments in prepublic companies through various predominantly sbic venture capital funds the company’s equity exposure to these investments was approximately 68 million and 56 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

additionally amegy has an alternative investments portfolio these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds were generally not a part of the strategy since the underlying companies were typically not creditworthy the carrying value of amegy ’ s equity investments was 54 million and 60 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

these private equity investments are subject to the provisions of the doddfrank act the volcker rule of the doddfrank act as published on december 10 2013 prohibits banks and bank holding companies from holding private equity investments beyond july 2015 except for sbic funds the company may apply for two oneyear exceptions that would extend the disposal deadline to july 2017 as of december 31 2013 such prohibited private equity investments except for sbic funds amounted to 58 million the company currently does not believe that this divestiture requirement will have a material negative impact on the value of these investments 

the company ’ s earnings from these investments and the potential volatility of these earnings are expected to decline over the next several years and will ultimately cease 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated 

financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary bank levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines for example the “time to required funding” and fixed charges coverage ratios that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and subsidiary banks as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the parent and bank liquidity 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally for the parent and jointly by the parent and bank management for its subsidiary banks zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division performs this management centrally under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the company’s liquidity policy these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and changes to the policy also must be approved by the company’s enterprise risk management committee and the board of directors the company has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk including a target for the parent ’ s timetorequired funding of 1824 months with a minimum policy limit of not less than 12 months throughout 2013 and as of december 31 2013 the company complied with this policy 

the subsidiary banks have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and the federal reserve and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank andor correspondent banks the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer 

in recent years international and us banking regulators have published for comment proposed rules that have as an objective to strengthen the liquidity positions of larger financial institutions including for example a newly defined liquidity coverage ratio these rules in general would require that institutions maintain higher levels of highly liquid onbalance sheet assets than they have sometimes held historically while none of these proposals has yet been adopted in final form the company believes that on a consolidated basis it would be in compliance with the rules if they were adopted as proposed 

contractual obligations 

schedule 38 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2013 

schedule 38 

contractual obligations 



 

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 38 the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of its business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

liquidity management actions 

consolidated cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements at the parent and its subsidiaries decreased to 93 billion at december 31 2013  from 105 billion at december 31 2012  the 12 billion decrease during 2013 resulted primarily from 1 net loan originations 2 an increase in investment securities 3 an increase in federal funds sold and 4 a net repayment of long term debt these decreases in cash were partially offset by 1 an increase in net cash provided by operating activities and 2 an increase in deposits 

parent company liquidity – the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders 

the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes and longterm debt and equity issuances 

cash interestbearing deposits held as investments and security resell agreements at the parent increased to 903 million at december 31 2013  from 653 million at december 31 2012  the 250 million increase during 2013 was primarily a result of 1 dividends received from its subsidiaries and 2 the redemption of subsidiary preferred stock issued to the parent as discussed subsequently these increases were partially offset by 1 a decrease in cash resulting from a net repayment of longterm debt and 2 the payment of preferred and common dividends 

during 2013  the parent received common dividends and return of common equity totaling 3768 million and preferred dividends totaling 448 million from its subsidiary banks also the parent received cash of 1750 million from its subsidiary banks as a result of the redemption of preferred stock issued to the parent during 2012 the parent received 3020 million from its subsidiaries for common dividends and return of common equity and preferred dividends and 7691 million from the redemption of preferred stock issued to the parent the dividends that our subsidiary banks can pay to the parent are restricted by current and historical earning levels retained earnings and riskbased and other regulatory capital requirements and limitations during 2013  all of the company’s subsidiary banks recorded a profit we expect that this profitability will be sustained thus permitting continued payments of dividends andor returns of capital by the subsidiaries to the parent during 2014 

in the second quarter of 2013 the company increased its quarterly dividend on its common stock to 004 per share from 001 per share that had been paid during the previous several years 

general financial market and economic conditions impact the company’s access to and cost of external financing access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the debt ratings and outlooks issued by the various rating agencies for the company did not change during 2013  except that standards  poor’s outlook improved to stable from negative while moody’s rates the company’s senior debt as ba1 one notch below investment grade standard  poor’s fitch dominion bond rating service “dbrs” and kroll all rate the company’s senior debt at an investment grade level in addition all of the previously mentioned rating agencies except kroll rate the company’s subordinated debt as noninvestment grade 

schedule 39 presents the parent’s ratings as of december 31 2013 

schedule 39 

credit ratings 



during 2013 the primary sources of additional cash to the parent in the capital markets were 1 the issuance of 8000 million par amount of preferred stock with a weighted average dividend rate of 62 proceeds net of commissions and fees were 7843 million and 2 a total issuance of 6471 million of unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturities between may 2016 and september 2028 interest rates between 275 and 695 with a weighted average interest rate of 49 proceeds net of commissions and fees were 6395 million 

the primary uses of cash in the capital markets for the parent during 2013  were 1 the 800 million redemption of 95 series c preferred stock 2 the 2850 million redemption of zions capital trust b trust preferred securities 

which carried an 80 interest rate previously included in longterm debt 3 the repurchase of 2580 million of the company’s 775 senior notes which had an effective interest expense rate of 110 due to original issue discount amortization and 4 a partial repurchase totaling 250 million of the 60 and 55 subordinated notes and convertible subordinated notes the convertible subordinated notes had effective interest expense rates in excess of 20 due to discount amortization 

during 2013  and 2012  the parent’s operating expenses included cash payments for interest of approximately 126 million and 124 million respectively additionally the parent paid approximately 120 million and 134 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock for the same periods preferred stock dividends were lower during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the redemption of the 14 billion tarp preferred stock and the replacement of the 110 series e preferred stock with the 79 series f preferred stock during 2012 due to the previously described preferred stock and debt refinancing activities we expect a material reduction in the cost of preferred equity and longterm debt in 2014 compared to 2013 

the company’s cash receipts from subsidiaries and investments covered the parent’s interest and dividend payments during 2013 and are expected to cover them in 2014 note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and cash flows for 2013 2012 and 2011 as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2013 and 2012 

at december 31 2013  maturities of the company’s longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from february 2014 to september 2028 with effective interest rates from 150 to 775 

see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of the company’s longterm debt 

subsidiary bank liquidity – the subsidiary banks’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2013  these core deposits excluding brokered deposits in aggregate constituted 971 of consolidated deposits compared with 966 at december 31 2012  on a consolidated basis the company’s net loan to total deposit ratio is 842 as of december 31 2013  compared to 816 as of december 31 2012  

total deposits increased by 229 million to 464 billion during 2013  mainly due to increases of 289 million in noninterestbearing demand deposits and 254 million in savings deposits partly offset primarily by a decrease of 370 million in time deposits also during 2013 the subsidiary banks sold most of their investments in security resell agreements which totaled 27 billion at december 31 2012 and increased their interestbearing deposits held for investment by 22 billion 

the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and from time to time have been a significant source of funding for each of the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank tcbw and tcbo are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nbaz are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy bank is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements the subsidiary banks are required to invest in fhlb and federal reserved stock to maintain their borrowing capacity 

at december 31 2013  the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 163 billion loans with a carrying value of approximately 230 billion at december 31 2013  and 211 billion at december 31 2012 have been pledged at the federal reserve and various fhlbs as collateral for current and potential borrowings the company had a de minimis amount approximately 23 million of longterm borrowings outstanding with the fhlb at december 31 2013 which was essentially unchanged from december 31 2012 and had no shortterm fhlb or federal reserve borrowings outstanding which also was unchanged from december 31 2012 at december 31 2013  and 2012 the subsidiary banks’ total investment in fhlb stock was approximately 105 million and 109 million respectively the subsidiary banks’ total investment in federal reserve stock was approximately 121 million and 123 million for the same respective dates 

the company’s investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture taken during 2013  investment securities’ activities resulted in a net increase in investment securities and a net 246 million decrease in cash compared with a net 322 million increase in cash for 2012 

maturing balances in our subsidiary banks’ loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows lending activity for 2013  resulted in a net cash outflow of 15 billion compared to a net cash outflow of 08 billion for 2012  

during 2013 the company paid income taxes of 181 million compared to 183 million during 2012 

operational risk management 

operational risk is the potential for unexpected losses attributable to human error systems failures fraud or inadequate internal controls and procedures in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has a corporate risk management department whose responsibility is to help management identify and assess key risks and monitor the key internal controls and processes that the company has in place to mitigate operational risk we have documented both controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

to manage and minimize its operating risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate the company’s systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to those systems to the company’s legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments in addition reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we maintain contingency plans and systems for operations support in the event of natural or other disasters 

efforts are continually underway to improve the company’s oversight of operational risk including enhancement of riskcontrol self assessments and antifraud measures which are reported to the enterprise risk management committee and to the risk oversight committee of the board late in 2013 the company further improved operational risk management by creating and staffing the position of director of operational risk to better coordinate and oversee the company’s operational risk management we also mitigate operational risk through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance however the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate the company’s critical systems sometimes referred to as hacking cyberfraud cyberattacks cyberterrorism or other similar names also continues to grow on a daily basis the company its customers and other financial institutions are subject to a large number of such attempts the company has established systems and procedures to monitor thwart or mitigate damage from such attempts and usually these efforts have been successful however in some instances we or our customers have been victimized by cyberfraud related losses to the company have not been material or some of our customers have been temporarily unable to routinely access our online systems as a result of for example distributed denial of service attacks 

capital management 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary banks other major cmc responsibilities include 

 the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

 in addition the cmc oversees the company’s capital stress testing under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios the company has established processes to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the company under hypothetical economic scenarios these stress tests facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity within quantitative limits reflecting the board of directors’ risk appetite these processes are also used to complete the company’s ccar as required by the federal reserve 

filing a capital plan with the federal reserve based on stresstesting and documented sound policies processes models controls and governance practices and the subsequent review by the federal reserve is an annual regulatory requirement this capital plan which is subject to objection by the federal reserve governs all of the company’s capital and significant unsecured debt financing actions for a period of five quarters among the actions governed by the capital plan are the repurchase of outstanding capital securities and the timing of new capital issuances and whether the company can pay or increase dividends any such action not included in a capital plan to which the federal reserve has not objected cannot be executed without submission of a revised stress test and capital plan for federal reserve review and nonobjection de minimis changes are allowed without a complete plan resubmission subject to receipt of a federal reserve nonobjection regulations require company disclosure of these stress tests results the company submitted its 2014 capital plan to the federal reserve on january 6 2014 and expects to receive a nonobjectionobjection decision from the federal reserve in midmarch 

the company plans to resubmit its 2014 capital plan to the federal reserve as a result of changes to the volcker rule of the doddfrank act that were incorporated into the interim final rule on january 14 2014 and the company’s decision to sell certain cdo securities which sales were completed on february 11 2014 the ifr allows banking entities to retain investments in primarily bank trups cdos the resubmitted plan will incorporate the impact of this exemption as well as the impact of changes to the company’s trups cdo position that have occurred subsequent to its january 6 2014 capital plan submission the company expects to resubmit a new stress 

test and capital plan by latemarch to midapril the final results will be published publicly by the federal reserve similar to the midmarch decision 

the company has made and will continue to make significant improvements to its internal stress testing risk management and related processes to meet the standards of the ccar process and is allocating significant resources to the successful implementation of these improvements 

during 2013 the company issued four new series of tier 1 capital qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series g h i and j and reopened and issued additional series a preferred stock the total par amount of these issuances is 800 million subsequent to these new preferred stock issuances on september 15 2013 the company redeemed all of its outstanding 800 million par amount series c preferred stock notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity risk management” on page 83 provide further information on the company’s equity and debt transactions during 2013 

controlling interest shareholders’ equity increased by 68 from 61 billion at december 31 2012 to 65 billion at december 31 2013 the increase in total controlling interest shareholders’ equity is primarily due to 2638 million of net income applicable to controlling interest and 2351 million improvement in net unrealized losses on investment securities recorded in aoci partially offset by 1196 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock the improvement in net unrealized losses on investment securities recorded in 2013 primarily was a result of the recognition in earnings of unrealized impairment losses on investment securities and to an increase in the fair value of the investment securities 

as discussed previously during the second quarter of 2013 the company increased its quarterly dividend on common stock to 004 per share this was an increase from 001 per share per quarter paid during the last several years reflecting this increase the company paid 241 million in dividends on common stock during 2013 compared to 74 million in 2012 during its january 2014 meeting the board of directors declared a dividend of 004 per common share payable on february 27 2014 to shareholders of record on february 20 2014 

the company recorded preferred stock dividends of 955 million for 2013  and 1709 million for 2012  preferred stock dividends for 2012  include 791 million related to the tarp preferred stock these consisted of cash payments of 344 million and accretion of 447 million which represented the difference between the fair value and par amount of the tarp preferred stock when it was issued as a result of the refinancing actions in 2013 the company estimates that preferred dividends will be approximately 72 million in 2014 

in prior years conversions of convertible subordinated debt into preferred stock augmented the company’s tier 1 regulatory capital position and reduced future refinancing needs however during 2013 only 12 million of subordinated debt was converted into preferred stock compared to 900 million in 2012 and 2561 million in 2011 a portion of the beneficial conversion feature was reclassified from common stock to preferred stock upon each conversion of convertible subordinated debt into preferred stock as of december 31 2013 227 million of convertible subordinated debt was outstanding as previously discussed during 2013 the company redeemed all of its outstanding 800 million par amount of series c preferred stock the legal right to convert subordinated debt into the company’s series a and c preferred stock still exists however we believe that currently there is no economic incentive to convert note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains further information related to the beneficial conversion feature 

banking organizations are required by capital regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios the company’ capital ratios as of december 31 2013 are shown in schedule 40 

schedule 40 

capital and performance ratios 



note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information on riskbased capital 

at december 31 2013  regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital were 5763 million and 6622 million respectively compared to 5884 million and 6617 million at december 31 2012  

basel iii 

in july 2013 the frb published final rules the “basel iii capital rules” establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the fdic and the occ have adopted substantially identical rules in the case of the fdic as interim final rules the rules implement the basel committee’s december 2010 framework commonly referred to as basel iii for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iii capital rules substantially revise the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including the company compared to the current us riskbased capital rules the basel iii capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing riskweighting approach which was derived from basel i capital accords of the basel committee with a more risksensitive approach based in part on the standardized approach in the basel committee’s 2004 basel ii capital accords the basel iii capital rules also implement the requirements of section 939a of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules the basel iii capital rules are effective for the company on january 1 2015 subject to phasein periods for certain of their components 

the basel iii capital rules among other things i introduce a new capital measure called “common equity tier 1” “cet1” ii specify that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements iii apply most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to the other components of capital thus potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratios and iv expand the scope of the deductionsadjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations 

under the basel iii capital rules the minimum capital ratios as of january 1 2015 will be as follows 

 

when fully phased in on january 1 2019 the basel iii capital rules will also require the company and its subsidiary banks to maintain a 25 “capital conservation buffer” composed entirely of cet1 on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 70 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 

the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

the basel iii capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 the company’s preliminary analysis indicates that application of this part of the rule should not result in any deductions from cet1 however the company estimates that the “corresponding deduction approach” section of the rules separately applied to the company’s significant concentration in investments in bank and insurance trust preferred collateralized debt obligations “cdos” securities would if the rules were phased in immediately eliminate a significant portion approximately 628 million of 1004 million of the company’s noncommon tier 1 capital pro forma incorporating recent sales of cdos in addition deductions from tier 2 capital would arise from our concentrated investment in insurance only trust preferred cdo securities these deductions will not begin until january 1 2015 for the company and even after january 1 2015 they will be phasedin in portions over time through the beginning of 2018 as indicated below thus the impact may be mitigated prior to or during the phasein period by repayment determination of otti additional accumulation of retained earnings andor additional sales of cdo securities 

under current capital standards the effects of aoci items included in capital are excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios under the basel iii capital rules the effects of certain aoci items are not excluded however “nonadvanced approaches banking organizations” including the company and its subsidiary banks may make a onetime permanent election as of january 1 2015 to continue to exclude these items the company has not yet determined whether to make this election the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 will be phased in incrementally between january 1 2015 and january 1 2018 

the basel iii capital rules require that trust preferred securities be phased out from tier 1 capital by the end of 2015 however for a banking organization such as the company that has greater than 15 billion in total consolidated assets but is not an “advanced approaches banking organization” the basel iii capital rules permit permanent inclusion of trust preferred securities issued prior to may 19 2010 in tier 2 capital regardless of whether they would meet the qualifications for tier 2 capital 

with respect to the company’s subsidiary banks the basel iii capital rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act by i introducing a cet1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level other than critically undercapitalized with the required cet1 ratio being 65 for wellcapitalized status ii increasing the minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category with the minimum tier 1 capital ratio for wellcapitalized status being 8 as compared to the current 6 and iii requiring a leverage ratio of 4 to be adequately capitalized as compared to the current 3 leverage ratio for a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 and a leverage ratio of 5 to be wellcapitalized the basel iii capital rules do not change the total riskbased capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category 

the basel iii capital rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets that expands the riskweighting categories from the current four basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much 

larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the basel iii capital rules also provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation 

the company believes that as of december 31 2013 the company and its subsidiary banks would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective including after giving effect to the deduction described above 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

1 tier 1 common capital 

traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulators have assessed a bank’s capital adequacy based on tier 1 capital the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations in july 2013 the frb published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations including the new cet1 capital measure the new capital rules are effective for the company on january 1 2015 however some key regulatory changes to the calculation of this measure are phased in over several years the cet1 capital ratio is the core capital component of the basel iii standards and we believe that it increasingly is becoming a key ratio considered by regulators investors and analysts there is a difference between this ratio calculated using basel i definitions of t1c capital and those definitions using basel iii rules we present the calculation of key regulatory capital ratios including t1c capital using the governing definition at the end of each quarter taking into account applicable phasein rules 

t1c capital is often expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets under the current riskbased capital framework applicable to the company a bank’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of offbalance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad “basel i” risk categories for banks like our subsidiary banks that have not adopted the basel ii “advanced measurement approach” the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the riskweighted assets total that as adjusted comprises the denominator of certain riskbased capital ratios tier 1 capital is then divided by this denominator riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 capital ratio adjustments are made to tier 1 capital to arrive at t1c capital t1c capital is also divided by the riskweighted assets to determine the t1c capital ratio the amounts disclosed as riskweighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements

for items 2 and 3 the identified adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are included where applicable in financial results or in the balance sheet presented in accordance with gaap we consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and financial position 

we believe that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the nongaap financial measures provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which will assist regulators investors and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the company and in predicting future performance these nongaap financial measures are used by management and the board of directors to assess the performance of the company’s business or its financial position for evaluating bank reporting segment performance for presentations of the company’s performance to investors and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts we further believe that presenting these nongaap financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management and the board of directors 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap

competition 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks credit unions and thrifts including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies and a variety of other types of companies many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include pricing convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered and the level of service delivered the company must compete effectively along all of these parameters to remain successful 

supervision and regulation 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended among other things to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers including depositors these regulations are not however generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the company the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the company 

the parent is a bank holding company and a financial holding company as provided by the bhc act as modified by the glb act the bhc act and other federal statutes as modified by the glb act and the doddfrank act provide the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the frb the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a bank holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator and the laws and regulations administered by those regulators the glb act allows our bank subsidiaries to engage in certain financial activities through financial subsidiaries to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company or to do business through a financial subsidiary the parent and its subsidiary banks must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required 

the parent’s subsidiary banks and wntc are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or other statutes governing national banks or for those that are statechartered banks the banking laws of their various states as well as the rules and regulations of the occ for those that are national banks the frb and the fdic they are also subject to periodic examination and supervision by the occ or their respective state banking departments the frb and the fdic many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other federal and state agencies these bank regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination role our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec finra andor state securities regulators 

the doddfrank act 

the events of the past few years have led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the united states 

the doddfrank act and regulations adopted under the doddfrank act broadly affect the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities requiring ongoing stress testing of our capital mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector among other things affecting capital standards the doddfrank act provides that 

 these provisions will require us to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets and will limit the forms of capital that we will be able to rely upon for regulatory purposes for example provisions of the doddfrank act require us to deduct all trust preferred securities from our tier 1 capital over a threeyear phaseout period that began january 1 2013 in addition in their supervisory role with respect to our stress testing and capital planning the bank regulatory agencies may effectively regulate certain of our capitalrelated actions such as dividends and stock repurchases as implemented by the bank regulatory agencies the stress testing and capital plan process could substantially reduce our flexibility to respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and pricing of certain products and services including the following 

 the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the cfpb was recently established and its impact on our subsidiary banks remains uncertain the doddfrank act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws which had enabled national banks 

and their subsidiaries to comply with federal regulatory requirements without complying with various state laws in addition the act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

the doddfrank act contains numerous provisions that limit or place significant burdens and costs on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds for the affected activities these provisions may result in increased compliance and other costs increased legal risk and decreased scope of product offerings 

the federal regulators have proposed regulations to implement the socalled “volcker rule” of the doddfrank act which would significantly restrict certain activities by covered bank holding companies including restrictions on proprietary trading and private equity investing the statutory provision became effective in july 2012 and banking entities subject to the volcker rule have until july 2014 to bring their activities and investments into compliance with the rule’s requirements however the federal financial regulatory agencies have not yet adopted rules implementing the volcker rule 

the company and other companies subject to the doddfrank act are being subjected to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules these requirements generally implement the compensation restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act and include documentation and governance deferral and clawback requirements 

as discussed further throughout this section many aspects of doddfrank are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company or the industry as of the end of 2012 approximately onethird of the total regulations to implement the doddfrank act had not yet been published for comment or adopted in final form 

capital standards – basel framework 

the frb has established capital guidelines for bank holding companies the occ the fdic and the frb have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks these bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the bcbs the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply 

in 2004 the bcbs proposed a new capital accord “basel ii” to replace basel i basel ii provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk an advanced internal ratingsbased approach tailored to individual institutions’ circumstances and a standardized approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in existing guidelines basel ii also sets capital requirements for operational risk and refines the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures 

in december 2007 us banking regulators published the final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approaches of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” the company is not required to comply with basel ii in july 2008 the agencies issued a proposed rule that would give banking organizations that do not use the advanced approaches the option to implement a new riskbased capital framework which would adopt the standardized approach of basel ii for credit risk the basic indicator approach of basel ii for operational risk and related disclosure requirements a definitive rule has not been issued 

in december 2010 the bcbs released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation now officially identified by the bcbs as “basel iii” basel iii when implemented by the us bank 

regulatory agencies and fully phasedin will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common equity as currently proposed the basel iii capital framework among other things 

 the basel iii final framework also requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes going forward will be required by regulation one test referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon or if greater 25 of its expected total cash outflow under an acute liquidity stress scenario the other referred to as the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon these requirements will incent banking entities to increase their holdings of us treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of longterm debt as a funding source the basel iii liquidity framework contemplates that the lcr will be subject to an observation period continuing through mid2013 and subject to any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted and data collected during the observation period implemented as a minimum standard on january 1 2015 similarly it contemplates that the nsfr will be subject to an observation period through mid2016 and subject to any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted and data collected during the observation period implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 these new standards are subject to rulemaking by the federal regulatory authorities and their terms may well change before implementation 

in june 2012 the us bank regulatory agencies issued three joint notices of proposed rulemaking npr that taken together would implement the capital reforms of the basel iii framework and changes required by the doddfrank act the first npr the basel iii npr generally follows the final basel iii framework described above and 

proposes higher minimum regulatory capital requirements and a more restrictive definition of regulatory capital as well as introduces limits on dividends and other capital distributions and certain discretionary bonuses if capital conservation buffers are not held the second npr the standardized approach npr proposes changes to the current basel i derived generalized riskbased capital requirements for determining riskweighted assets that expands the riskweighting categories from the current four basel iderived categories 0 20 50 and 100 to a much larger number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories lastly the advanced approaches npr proposes changes to the advanced approaches rules to be consistent with requirements of basel ii in its most current form and with the doddfrank act the us bank regulatory agencies have not proposed rules implementing the final liquidity framework of basel iii and have not determined to what extent they will apply to us banks that are not large internationally active banks 

although the basel iii npr does not specify an effective date or implementation date it was contemplated that it would coincide with the international basel iii implementation schedule which commenced on january 1 2013 the standardized approach npr contemplated an effective date of january 1 2015 subject to early adoption at the option of subject institutions however in november 2012 the us bank regulatory agencies announced that they do not expect any of the three nprs implementing basel iii in the united states to become effective on january 1 2013 there can be no guarantee that the basel iii and the standardized approach nprs will be adopted in their current form what changes may be made before adoption or when ultimate adoption will occur given that the basel iii rules are subject to change and the scope and content of capital regulations that the us banking agencies may adopt under doddfrank is uncertain we cannot be certain of the impact new capital regulations will have on our capital ratios 

stress testing prudential standards and early remediation 

as a bank holding company with assets greater than 50 billion the company is required by the doddfrank act to participate in an annual stress test known as the capital plan review the company timely submitted its capital plan and stress test results to the frb in january 2013 in this capital plan the company was required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios for nine quarters ending the fourth quarter of 2014 its estimated regulatory capital ratios under basel i rules its tier 1 common ratio under basel i rules the same ratios under basel iii rules and its gaap tangible common equity ratio as noted implementing regulations that define how many of these ratios are to be calculated by us institutions have not been adopted under the implementing regulations for the capital plan review bank holding company may generally raise and redeem capital pay dividends and repurchase stock and take similar capitalrelated actions only under a capital plan as to which the frb has not objected 

in december 2011 the frb published new proposed regulations entitled “enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements for covered companies” which if adopted would apply to all bank holding companies with assets greater than 50 billion the comment period on these proposed regulations for systemically important financial institutions proposed sifi rules expired april 30 2012 but except as described below regarding stress testing the proposed sifi rules have not become final as of february 2013 the proposed sifi rules would implement many of the proposed aspects of the basel iii capital and liquidity regime and would specify conditions under which a bank holding company would be placed under enhanced nonpublic or public supervision and restrictions the proposed sifi rules would also require each covered institution to establish a risk committee of its board of directors that would include a “risk expert” the proposed sifi rules proposed to expand the stress testing requirements to include among other things stress testing by the frb under three economic and financial scenarios baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios in october 2012 the federal reserve published final rules implementing that portion of the proposed sifi rules expanding the stress testing requirements including public disclosure of results 

prompt corrective action 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act or fdicia requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions including but not limited to 

those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios pursuant to fdicia the fdic promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia an insured depository institution generally will be classified as wellcapitalized if it has a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its total riskbased capital is less than 8 or its tier 1 riskbased capital or leverage ratio is less than 4 an institution that based upon its capital levels is classified as “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment the june 2012 basel iii npr described above would also revise the prompt corrective action regime by i introducing a ceti ratio requirement at every level other than critically undercapitalized with the required ceti ratio being 65 for wellcapitalized status ii increasing the minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category with the minimum tier 1 capital ratio for wellcapitalized status being 8 as compared to the current 6 and iii eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3 leverage ratio and still be wellcapitalized at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan 

other regulation 

the company is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

 11 

compensation as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies the safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in their supervisory authority over us 

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate 

governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a comprehensive system of corporate governance practices this system includes corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines a compensation clawback policy and charters for the audit risk oversight executive compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k in addition the company has adopted policies prohibiting hedging and restricting pledging of company stock by insiders 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit the tools available to the frb which may be used to implement monetary policy include 

 these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 




 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee and an enterprise risk management policy and has appointed an enterprise risk management committee to oversee and implement the policy in addition to credit and interest rate risk the committee also monitors the following risk areas market risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk information technology risk strategic risk compensationrelated risk and reputation risk 

the following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the company including but not limited to 

the company has been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

the united states and many other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected the company’s assets including its loans and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition in response to the economic crisis the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis these programs and policies appear to have had a stabilizing effect in the united states following the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of 2008 but adverse 

economic conditions continue to exist in the united states and globally concerns about the european union’s sovereign debt crisis have continued to cause uncertainty for financial markets globally it is possible economic conditions may again become more severe or that adverse economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time in addition economic uncertainty resulting from possible changes in the ratings of sovereign debt issued by the united states and other nations and fiscal imbalances in the united states at federal state and municipal levels in the european union and in other countries combined with political difficulties in resolving these imbalances may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic conditions faced by the company and its customers any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions including a recession or continued weak economic recovery would adversely affect the company 

our information systems may experience an interruption or security breach 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we our customers and other financial institutions with which we interact are subject to ongoing continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers organized criminals and in some cases statesponsored organizations any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems misappropriation of funds and theft of proprietary company or customer data while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

stress testing and capital management under doddfrank may limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

under stress testing and capital management standards implemented by bank regulatory agencies under doddfrank we may declare dividends repurchase common stock redeem preferred stock and debt access capital markets for certain types of capital make acquisitions and enter into similar transactions only with bank regulatory approval any transactions not contemplated in our annual capital plan will require frb approval these limitations may significantly limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments 

the doddfrank act imposes significant new limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank act has material implications for the company and the entire financial services industry the act places significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions including the company with more than 50 billion of assets in addition among other things the act 

 because the responsible agencies are still in the process of proposing and finalizing many of the regulations required under the doddfrank act the full impact of this legislation on the company its business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for some time individually and collectively regulations adopted under the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

us regulatory agencies in response to the adoption of basel iii and title i of the doddfrank act will require us to raise our capital and liquidity to levels that may exceed those that the market considers to be optimal 

basel iii was adopted in december 2010 and was updated in january 2013 by the bcbs and provides an international framework for the establishment of bank capital and liquidity standards title i of the doddfrank act requires that banking organizations of our size undergo regular stress testing of their capital assets and profitability and authorizes bank regulatory agencies to promulgate new capital and liquidity standards in 2012 the us bank regulatory agencies published proposed regulations that consistent with basel iii and the doddfrank act would redefine the components of capital and require higher capital ratios for all banking organizations the us banking agencies are currently developing proposed rules to implement the basel iii liquidity framework for us banking organizations maintaining higher capital and liquidity levels may reduce our profitability and performance measures 

economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

the company’s subsidiary banks must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by their banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions and their particular condition risk profile and growth plans compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require capital investment from the parent these uncertainties and risks created by the legislative and regulatory uncertainties discussed above may themselves increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

credit quality has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks although most credit quality indicators continued to improve during 2012 the company’s credit quality may continue to show weakness in some loan types and markets in which the company operates as the economic recovery progresses 

if the strength of the us economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we and our subsidiary banks conduct operations decline further this could result in among other things further deterioration in credit quality andor continued reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses if such developments occur we may be required to raise additional capital 

failure to effectively manage our credit concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect us 

increases in concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the company concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the company due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk but it is routinely monitored and analyzed 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue the management of interest rate risk for the company and its subsidiary banks is centralized and overseen by an asset liability management committee appointed by the company’s board of directors we have been successful in our interest rate risk management as evidenced by achieving a relatively stable net interest margin over the last several years when interest rates have been volatile and the rate environment challenging however a failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates subject to general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

the company remains in an “asset sensitive” interest rate risk position and the frb has stated its expectations that shortterm interest rates may remain low until unemployment is reduced to below 65 or inflationary expectations exceed 25 such a scenario may continue to create or exacerbate margin compression for us as a result of repricing of longerterm loans 

our ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity has been and may continue to be adversely affected by market conditions 

we are required to maintain certain capital levels in accordance with banking regulations and any capital requirements imposed by our regulators we must also maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support our operations and fund outstanding liabilities our ability to maintain capital levels sources of funding and liquidity has been and could continue to be impacted by changes in the capital markets in which we operate and deteriorating economic and market conditions 

each of our subsidiary banks must remain wellcapitalized and meet certain other requirements for us to retain our status as a financial holding company failure to comply with those requirements could result in a loss of our financial holding company status if such conditions are not corrected within 180 days or such longer period as may be permitted by the frb although we do not believe that the loss of such status would have an appreciable effect on our operations or financial results in addition failure by our bank subsidiaries to meet applicable capital guidelines or to satisfy certain other regulatory requirements can result in certain activity restrictions or a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities that include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic 

funding availability continued to improve during 2012 however because liquidity stresses are often a consequence of the occurrence of other risks they will continue to be a risk factor in 2013 and beyond for the company the parent and its subsidiary banks 

the quality and liquidity of our assetbacked investment securities portfolio has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

the company’s assetbacked investment securities portfolio includes collateralized debt obligations collateralized by trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies insurance companies and reits that may have some exposure to construction loan commercial real estate and the subprime markets andor to other categories of distressed assets in addition assetbacked securities also include structured assetbacked cdos also known as diversified structured finance cdos which have exposure to subprime and home equity mortgage securitizations many factors some of which are beyond the company’s control significantly influence the fair value and impairment status of these securities these factors include but are not limited to prepayments defaults deferrals and restructurings by debt issuers the views of banking regulators changes in our accounting treatment with respect to these securities rating agency downgrades of securities lack of market pricing of securities or the return of market pricing that varies from the company’s current model valuations and changes in prepayment rates and future interest rates for example during the fourth quarter of 2012 we disclosed our expectation that increased prepayments experienced in our cdo portfolio during the fourth quarter would lead to higher otherthantemporary impairment charges as a result of the use of higher constant prepayment rate speeds in our valuation models for these securities additionally we also disclosed that following discussions with federal banking regulators we were reviewing assumptions in our valuation models for certain bank holding company trust preferred securities that underlie certain of our cdo securities – namely those that are currently deferring distributions and nearing the end of their deferral periods we disclosed that in combination with the effect of the higher cpr speeds this could lead to the incurrence of significant otti in our cdo portfolio the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in additional otti charges with respect to our cdo portfolio which could be material see “investment securities portfolio” on page 49 for further details 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us certain of our affiliates and particular classes of securities that we and our affiliates issue the interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we our affiliates andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies in the past rating agencies have downgraded our credit ratings further downgrades to us our affiliates or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the company to comply before their formal adoption 

the company provides to its customers invests in and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements therefore pose an ongoing risk 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

the company is subject to risks associated with legal claims fines litigation and regulatory and other government proceedings the company’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the current economic environment new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes and the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to continually strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations 

we could be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions 

from time to time the company makes acquisitions including the acquisition of assets and liabilities of failed banks from the fdic acting as a receiver the fdicsupported transactions are subject to loan loss sharing agreements failure to comply with the terms of the agreements could result in the loss of indemnification from the fdic the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the projected cost savings from the acquisition and on the continued growth and profitability of the acquisition target we have been successful with most prior acquisitions but it is possible that the merger integration process with an acquired company could result in the loss of key employees disruptions in controls procedures and policies or other factors that could affect our ability to realize the projected savings and successfully retain and grow the target’s customer base and revenues

executive summary 

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 56 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is considered a “systemically important” financial institution under the doddfrank act 

 

longterm strategy 

we strive to maintain a local communityregional bank approach for customerfacing elements of our business we believe that our target customers consisting largely of small and midsized businesses appreciate local branding product customization and speedy decisionmaking by local management by retaining a significant degree of autonomy in product offerings and pricing we believe our banks have a sustainable competitive advantage over larger national banks where loan and deposit products are often homogeneous however we strive to centralize noncustomer facing operations such as risk and capital management and technology and operations by centralizing many of these functions we believe we can generally achieve greater economies of scale and stronger risk management and that our portfolio of community banks has superior access to the capital markets investment portfolio and treasury management liquidity resources and technological advances than do smaller independent community banks   

our strategy is driven by four key factors 

 

focus on growth markets 

the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in growth markets the states in our geographic footprint have experienced higher rates of economic growth than other states our footprint is well diversified by industry strong business formation rates real estate development and general economic expansion while some states in our footprint experienced a significant slowing in economic activity during the recent recession others have experienced aboveaverage growth and stronger resistance to the economic downturn we believe the company can continue to experience aboveaverage revenue growth in the long term in part because the majority of our footprint is concentrated in states that have above average gdp population and job growth and where the economies are well diversified 

 the higher economic growth indicators of gdp and job creation in our footprint are driven by the economies of texas california and utah where more than 75 of the company’s assets are located 

texas has a well diversified economy that is the third largest in the united states significant drivers of its growth are the energy health care manufacturing real estate and computer technology sectors these sectors have propelled the texas economy to outperform the nation as employers have added jobs in the past 12 months which has resulted in the unemployment rate declining to 61 compared to the national rate of 78 amegy’s three primary markets houston dallas and san antonio experienced job growth in 2012 amegy has 13 billion in assets which represent 24 of the company’s assets in addition the texas economic environment benefits from businessfriendly growth policies affordable housing markets and a relatively small percentage of homeowner borrowers in a negative equity situation see “business segment results” on page 44 for further discussion on the 2012 performance of amegy 

california’s economy is the largest in the united states representing approximately 13 of the nation’s gdp and is based on a diverse group of business sectors the state has been experiencing improvements in residential and cre values additionally voters recently approved increases in taxes to shore up the state’s budget shortfall however state and local finances remain under strain california has one of the lowest state credit ratings and several major municipalities filed for or remained under bankruptcy protection in 2012 california bank  trust’s “cbt” primary markets – the major metropolitan areas in california including the san francisco bay area los angeles county orange county and san diego – continued to experience economic improvements in 2012 compared to 2011 cbt has approximately 11 billion in assets which represent 20 of the company’s assets trends in unemployment home foreclosures and bank credit problems continue to improve throughout california resulting in corresponding reductions in problem credits and nonperforming assets at cbt the state’s unemployment rate declined from its peak as follows – 124 in october 2010 112 in december 2011 and 98 in december 2012 – but remains well above the 78 national average unemployment rates are much lower in cbt’s primary markets compared to the state as a whole see “business segment results” on page 44 for further discussion on the 2012 performance of cbt 

the utah economy is primarily based on the energy agriculture real estate computer technology education health care and financial services sectors during 2012 utah employment grew at a 29 rate compared to the national employment growth rate of 14 this growth decreased utah’s overall unemployment rate to 52 in 2012 from 58 in 2011 zions bank is the second largest fullservice commercial bank in the state of utah as measured by domestic deposits and operates in all submarkets of the state zions bank has approximately 18 billion in assets which represent 32 of the company’s assets in addition the utah state government has been recognized for its policies promoting a businessfriendly climate providing a predictable and stable tax policy and controlling 

government spending levels see “business segment results” on page 44 for further discussion on the 2012 performance of zions bank 

keep decisions that affect customers local 

we believe that over the long term ensuring that local management teams retain the authority over many of the decisions that affect their customers is a strategy that ultimately generates superior growth in our banking businesses as supported by stronger organic loan and deposit growth relative to other banks 

 

maintain a sustainable competitive advantage over community banks 

to create a sustainable competitive advantage over other smaller community banks we focus on achieving product selection productivity economies of scale availability of liquidity and a lower cost of capital compared to community banks 

 

centralize and standardize policies and oversight of key risks 

we seek to standardize policies and practices related to the management of key risks in order to assure a consistent risk profile in an otherwise decentralized management model among these key risks and functions are credit interest rate liquidity and market risks 

 

management’s overview of 2012 performance 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2012 of 1786 million or 097 per diluted common shared compared to 1534 million or 083 per diluted common share for 2011

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies further explanations of significant accounting policies are included where applicable in the remaining notes to consolidated financial statements discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the company’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of certain of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial 

transactions of the company is important to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

the company measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measures current accounting guidance has established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the related life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the company’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs 

and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are periodically evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced 

liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable therefore when market data is not available the company would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair 

value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors certain cdos are valued using an internal model and the assumptions are analyzed for sensitivity “investment securities portfolio” on page 49   provides more information regarding this analysis 

investment securities are reviewed formally on a quarterly basis for the presence of otti the evaluation process takes into account current market conditions the fair value of the security and many other factors the decision to deem these securities otti is based on a specific analysis of the structure of each security and an evaluation of the underlying collateral otti is considered to have occurred if 1 we intend to sell the security 2 it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis the “more likely than not” criteria is a lower threshold than the “probable” criteria 

notes 1 5 7 9 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “investment securities portfolio” on page 49 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio but which have not been specifically identified the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes a quantitative analysis as well as a qualitative review of its results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment and is described in more detail in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the allowance for loan losses plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn 

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses which includes a quantitative and a qualitative process although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses   as an example if a total of 15 billion of pass grade loans were to be immediately classified as special mention substandard or doubtful as defined in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the same proportion and in the same loan categories as the existing criticized and classified loans to the whole portfolio the quantitatively determined amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2012 would increase by approximately 76 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in the level of the criticized and classified loans may have on the allowance estimation process 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the allowance for loan losses such factors include but are not limited to national and regional economic trends and indicators we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the allowance for loan losses for the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 64   contain further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the allowance for credit losses 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance we perform this annual test as of october 1 of each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit generally one of our subsidiary banks compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired 

to determine the fair value we generally use a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies primarily banks and bank holding companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the company is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the company’s geographic footprint and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium of 25 was appropriate at the most recent test date 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount estimates include economic conditions which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital the fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions including federal reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

weakening in the economic environment a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the company ’ s regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective october 1 2012 upon completion of the evaluation process we concluded that the commerce bank of oregon was the only one of our subsidiary banks that was impaired the company recorded an impairment charge of 1 million which was the total amount of goodwill associated with that subsidiary furthermore the evaluation process determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 18 33 and 15 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100 bps then the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 12 28 and 5 respectively note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains additional information related to goodwill 

accounting for derivatives 

our interest rate risk management strategy involves the use of hedging to mitigate our exposure to potential adverse effects from changes in interest rates 

the derivative contracts used by the company are exchangetraded or otc exchangetraded derivatives consist of forward currency exchange contracts which are part of the company’s services provided to commercial customers otc derivatives consist of interest rate swaps options and futures contracts 

we record all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet when quoted market prices are not available the valuation of derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative these future net cash flows however are susceptible to change due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates most significantly and foreign exchange rates as a result the estimated values of these derivatives will change over time as cash is received and paid and as market conditions change as these changes take place they may have a positive or negative impact on our estimated valuations 

we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both the company’s own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its otc derivatives based on a total expected exposure credit model in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings current threshold amounts mutual puts and guarantees additionally we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for significant changes 

notes 1 7 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “interest rate and market risk management” on page 78 contain further information on our use of derivatives and the methodologies used to estimate fair value 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where the company conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

the company had net deferred tax assets “dtas” of 406 million at december 31 2012 compared to 509 million at december 31 2011 the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the allowance for loan losses and 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2012 related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve 

related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to 1 carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods 2 implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible 3 utilize the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences and 4 generate future taxable income 

after considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits the company has tax reserves at december 31 2012 of approximately 18 million net of federal andor state benefits for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted where applicable the other notes to consolidated financial statements and mda discuss new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2012 to the extent they materially affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity   

results of operations 

in 2012 the company reclassified credit card interchange fee income from interest and fees on loans to other service charges commissions and fees additionally income on factored receivables was reclassified from other service charges commissions and fees to interest and fees on loans there was no change in net earnings for any prior year presented and the reclassification did not significantly impact the company ’ s net interest margin see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2012 of 1786 million or 097 per diluted share compared to 1534 million or 083 per diluted share for 2011 the following changes had a favorable impact on net earnings 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 32 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2011 of 1534 million or 083 per diluted share compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of 4125 million or 248 per diluted share for 2010 the significant improvement in net earnings was mainly caused by the following favorable changes 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 during 2009 the company executed a subordinated debt modification and exchange transaction the original discount on the resulting convertible subordinated debt was 679 million and the remaining discount at december 31 2012 was 149 million it included the following components 

 the discount associated with the convertible subordinated debt is amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the remaining term of the subordinated debt referred to herein as “discount amortization” when holders of the convertible subordinated notes convert into preferred stock the rate of amortization is accelerated by immediately expensing any unamortized discount associated with the converted debt referred to herein as “accelerated discount amortization” 

excluding the impact of these noncash expenses income before income taxes and subordinated debt conversions for 2012 was 6164 million compared to 6828 million for 2011 as shown in schedule 2

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest incurred on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest portion of the company’s revenue for 2012 taxableequivalent net interest income was 17502 million compared to 17764 million and 17360 million for 2011and 2010 respectively the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all periods presented 

net interest margin in 2012 vs 2011 

the net interest margin was 357 and 377 for 2012 and 2011 respectively the 20 bps decrease was primarily caused by 

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following favorable developments 

 even though the company’s average loan portfolio excluding fdicsupported loans was 359 million higher in 2012 than in the previous year the average interest rate earned on those assets was 41 bps lower the decline in interest income was primarily caused by 1 adjustable rate loans originated in the past resetting to lower rates due to the current repricing index being lower than the rate when the loans were originated and 2 maturing loans many of which had rate floors being replaced with new loans at lower original coupons andor lower floors compared to the rates at which loans were originated when spreads were higher 

during 2012 most of the company’s excess liquidity was invested in money market assets primarily deposits with the federal reserve bank average money market investments increased to 162 of total interestearning assets in 2012 compared to 114 in the previous year the average rate earned by these investments was 027 in 2012 essentially unchanged from 2011 

noninterestbearing demand deposits provided the company with low cost funding and comprised 384 of average total deposits in 2012 compared to 352 in 2011 additionally the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits in 2012 decreased by 18 bps from the previous year 

net interest margin in 2011 vs 2010 

in 2011 the net interest margin increased by 7 bps to 377 compared to 370 in 2010 the increase was primarily caused by 

 the impact of these positive developments was partially offset by 

 the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits declined 21 bps to 048 in 2011 from 069 in 2010 the decline in interest rates paid during 2011 reflects a lower interest rate environment and management’s efforts to control excess liquidity while preserving key customer relationships average noninterestbearing demand deposits increased during 2011 and were 352 of average total deposits compared to 319 in 2010 

the average loan portfolio excluding fdicsupported loans decreased to 360 billion in 2011 from 371 billion in 2010 the average interest rate earned on these loans declined 20 bps to 534 in 2011 from 554 in 2010 

chart 4 illustrates recent trends in the net interest margin and the average federal funds rate 

see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 78   for further discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and associated risk 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 316 321 and 308 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2012 was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the net interest margin 

we believe the following factors may positively impact net interest income in the next several quarters decreased level of nonperforming assets decreased longterm debt service cost and moderate loan growth however net loan growth has proven to be difficult to forecast even though our pipelines and new commitment originations remain relatively strong we also believe the following factors may adversely affect net interest income competitive loan pricing conditions lower yields on resetting or maturing older loans and declines in the reference index rates for adjustable rate loans on balance we expect the trend in net interest income to be generally stable for the next several quarters 

the unamortized discount on the convertible subordinated debt was 149 million as of december 31 2012 or 326 of the 458 million of remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the debt using the interest method at december 31 2011 the unamortized discount on the convertible subordinated debt was 224 million or 41 of the 547 million of convertible subordinated notes which were outstanding at that time 

the company expects to remain “assetsensitive” with regard to interest rate risk the current period of historically low interest rates has lasted for several years during this time the company has maintained an interest rate risk position that is more asset sensitive than it was prior to the economic crisis and more than most peers and it expects to maintain this more asset sensitive position for what may be a prolonged period with interest rates at historically low levels there is a reduced need to protect against falling interest rates our estimates of the company’s actual interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes see ”interest rate risk” on page 79 for additional information

provisions for credit losses 

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level based 

upon the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various loan portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs credit trends and external factors see note 6   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 64 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the alll and the rulc 

the provision for loan losses for 2012 was 142 million compared to 745 million and 8527 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively the company continues to exercise caution with regard to the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses given the slow economic recovery however during the past 24 months the company has experienced a significant improvement in credit quality metrics including lower levels of criticized and classified loans and lower realized loss rates in most loan segments at december 31 2012 classified loans were 19 billion compared to 23 billion and 37 billion at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively additionally construction and land development loans declined to 51 of the loan portfolio at december 31 2012 compared to 61 a year earlier 

net loan and lease chargeoffs declined to 155 million in 2012 from 456 million in 2011 and 983 million in 2010 in the fourth quarter of 2012 the annualized ratio of net loan and lease chargeoffs to average loans declined to 020 and is approaching prerecessionary levels the ratio of net loan and lease chargeoffs to average loans was 017 in 2007 however net chargeoffs were favorably impacted by a relatively high level of recoveries in 2012 gross chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2012 were 547 million or 059 annualized of average loans see “nonperforming assets” on page 73 and “allowance and reserve for credit losses” on page 76 for further details 

during 2012 the company recorded a 44 million provision for unfunded lending commitments compared to reductions in the provision of 93 million in 2011 and 47 million in 2010 the increased provision for 2012 is primarily caused by a higher level of unfunded loan commitments which outpaced improvements in credit quality during 2011 and 2010 the credit quality of unfunded loans improved more rapidly than the increase in unfunded loan commitments allowing the company to release previously recorded reserves from period to period the expense related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizeable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations and funding as well as fluctuations in credit quality 

although classified and nonperforming loan volumes continue to be elevated when compared to longterm historical levels most measures of credit quality continued to show improvement in 2012 barring any significant economic downturn we expect the company’s credit costs to remain low for the next several quarters we also anticipate continued declines in balances of criticized and classified loans of most types and continued low levels of net chargeoffs for the next several quarters compared to the elevated levels experienced from 2008 through 2011 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues the company earns for products and services that have no interest rate or yield associated with them for 2012 noninterest income was 4199 million compared to 4982 million in 2011 and 4536 million in 2010

schedule 5 

noninterest income 



service charges and fees on deposit accounts remained stable in 2012 when compared to the prior year in 2011 this revenue decreased by 253 million or 127 from 2010 primarily due to a decline in nonsufficient funds fees and a decrease in fees earned from business accounts 

other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of atm fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit and credit card interchange fees cash management fees lending commitment fees syndication and servicing fees and other miscellaneous fees decreased by 115 million in 2012 from the prior year most of the decline can be attributed to decreased debit card interchange and atm fees partially offset by growth in credit card interchange fees and loan fees see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the reclassification of fees 

on june 29 2011 the federal reserve voted to adopt regulations implementing the durbin amendment of the doddfrank act which placed limits on debit card interchange fees charged by banks the durbin amendment became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011 and resulted in a significant decrease in other service charges commissions and fees during 2012 

other service charges commissions and fees increased 75 million in 2011 compared to 2010 most of the increase can be attributed to increased credit card fees loan fees and fees earned from other banks’ customers using the company’s atms partially offset by decreased debit card fees and remote deposit capture licensing fees the company sold substantially all of the assets of its netdeposit subsidiary in the third quarter of 2010 and therefore did not earn any licensing fees in 2011 

capital markets and foreign exchange includes trading income public finance fees foreign exchange income and other capital market related fees in 2012 these fees were 268 million compared to 314 million in the prior year the decrease was primarily caused by lower income from trading fixed income corporate bonds and decreased foreign exchange income partially offset by higher fees from municipal bond transactions in 2012 in anticipation of the adoption of the “volcker rule” of the doddfrank act the company discontinued the trading of corporate bonds 

capital markets and foreign exchange income was 314 million in 2011 compared to 376 million in 2010 the decrease was caused mainly by lower income from trading fixed income corporate bonds and a reduction in consulting fees related to municipal bond transactions 

dividends and other investment income consists of revenue from the company’s bankowned life insurance program and revenues from other investments revenues from other investments include dividends on fhlb and federal reserve bank stock and earnings from other equity investments including federal agricultural mortgage corporation and certain alternative venture investments for 2012 this income increased by 316 from the prior year mainly due to higher earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries 

dividends and other investment income increased by 281 in 2011 from 331 million in 2010 the increase was primarily caused by higher income from several unconsolidated affiliates partially offset by decreased income from bankowned life insurance contracts 

loan sales and servicing income increased by 119 million in 2012 or 423 from the prior year the increase is primarily due to larger gains from loan sales loan sales and servicing income remained fairly stable from 2010 to 2011 

fair value and nonhedge derivative loss consists of the following 

schedule 6 

fair value and nonhedge derivative loss 



fair value and nonhedge derivative losses were 218 million in 2012 50 million in 2011 and 158 million in 2010 the increased loss in 2012 is mainly due to higher fees related to the trs agreement and a decrease in income from eurodollar futures trs fees were lower in 2011 than in 2012 and 2010 due to the timing of expense recognition 

during 2012 the company recorded 113 million in equity securities gains compared to 65 million in 2011 and losses of 60 million in 2010 the gains recognized in 2012 were primarily attributable to sbic investments the gains realized in 2011 were principally due to the sale of bserv inc stock which the company acquired in september 2010 when it sold the assets of its netdeposit subsidiary the loss incurred in 2010 was primarily the result of valuation losses related to venture fund investments 

the company recorded 196 million of fixed income securities gains in 2012 compared to 119 million in 2011 and 111 million in 2010 gains in 2012 and 2011 were primarily the result of cash principal payments received on cdos that were originally purchased from lockhart funding and written down to fair value at the time of purchase the gains in 2010 are mainly the result of the sale of certain auction rate securities which were previously written down to fair value but sold at par 

  

the company recognized net impairment losses on cdo investment securities of 1041 million in 2012 337 million in 2011 and 854 million in 2010 see “investment securities portfolio” on page 49 for additional information 

during 2010 the company exchanged 556 million of nonconvertible subordinated debt for 2165391 shares of common stock resulting in a 145 million gain 

other noninterest income for 2012 was 131 million compared to 296 million in 2011 in 2011 the company received payments from the fdic related to certain acquired loans which had been determined to be covered by a loss sharing agreement in 2010 other noninterest income was 295 million which included a 137 million pretax gain recognized from the sale of substantially all of the assets of a whollyowned subsidiary netdeposit 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense decreased by 38 to 15960 million in 2012 compared to 2011 during the past year the company made significant progress in resolving problem loans and improving the credit quality of its loan portfolio which resulted in significantly lower other real estate and creditrelated expenses the improved credit quality contributed to lower fdic premiums schedule 7 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

  schedule 7 

noninterest expense 

salaries and employee benefits increased by 13 during 2012 compared to 59 in 2011 salary expense for 2012 included sharebased compensation expense of 315 million bonus and incentive expenses were lower in 2012 than in 2011 because certain longterm incentive compensation plans are no longer expected to pay out or to pay out at a reduced amount additionally the company’s workforce declined by 22 during 2012 

salary and bonus expense increased in 2011 by 34 from 2010 most of the increase during 2011 was due to higher base salary and bonus expenses which resulted from hiring additional staff necessary to meet new regulatory reporting requirements and from the company’s improved financial performance salary expense for 2011 included sharebased compensation expense of approximately 290 million retirement expense and the cost of employee health and other insurance benefits also increased mainly due to higher retirement related accruals 

salaries and employee benefits are shown in greater detail in schedule 8 

schedule 8 

salaries and employee benefits 



other real estate expense decreased in 2012 by 746 from the prior year the decrease is primarily due to a 359 reduction in oreo balances during the last 12 months which resulted in reduced holding expenses as well as lower writedowns of collateral carrying values 

other real estate expense decreased by 464 in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease is primarily driven by a 489 reduction in oreo balances between these two years lower writedowns of oreo values during workout as well as larger net gains from oreo property sales 

credit related expense includes costs incurred during the foreclosure process prior to the company obtaining title to collateral and recording an asset in oreo as well as other outofpocket costs related to the management of problem loans and other assets credit related expense was 505 million in 2012 compared to 616 million in 2011 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower property tax and legal costs incurred during workout in 2011 credit related expenses were 135 lower than in 2010 mainly due to a reduction in collection and foreclosure costs 

legal and professional services were 135 million higher in 2012 than in the previous year the increase is mostly due to regulatory legal and contractual matters legal and professional services remained practically unchanged from 2010 to 2011 

fdic premiums decreased by 321 during 2012 following a 374 decrease in the prior year these decreases resulted from the combination of a change in the premium assessment formulas prescribed by the fdic and improved risk factors employed in those formulas 

other noninterest expense decreased by 108 million in 2012 from the previous year the decline is primarily the result of lower writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset attributable to loans purchased from the fdic in 2009 fdicsupported loans continued to perform better than expected including payoffs and paydowns the balance of the fdic indemnification asset continues to decline although at a slower rate compared to prior years other noninterest expense in 2012 included a 10 million goodwill impairment 

other noninterest expense for 2011 increased by 39 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of an increased writedown of the fdic indemnification asset attributable to loans purchased from the fdic in 2009 fdicsupported loans continued to perform better than expected and the balance of the fdic indemnification asset declined 

impairment loss on goodwill 

the company performed a goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2012 and recorded a 10 million goodwill impairment loss at the commerce bank of oregon this goodwill originally arose from the company’s acquisition of a bank in order to operate a bank in oregon in 2012 oregon law was changed to no longer require

as discussed in previous filings the company has received federal income tax credits under the us government’s community development financial institutions fund that are recognized over a sevenyear period from the year of investment the effect of these tax credits provided an income tax benefit of 12 million in 2012 24 million in 2011 and 60 million in 2010 

the company had a net dta balance of approximately 406 million at december 31 2012 compared to 509 million at december 31 2011 the decrease in the net dta resulted primarily from items related to nonaccruing loans fair value adjustments on securities nol utilization and oreo the net decrease in dta was offset by a decrease in the deferred tax liability related to the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock the company did not record any additional valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2012 see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 27   for additional information

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities and loans and leases schedule 3  which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of the company’s interest earning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another goal is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interestearning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets such as money market investments and securities while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets the current period of slow economic growth accompanied by the moderate loan demand experienced in recent quarters has made it difficult to consistently achieve these goals 

average interestearning assets were 490 billion in 2012 compared to 472 billion in the previous year average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 920 in 2012 and 918 in 2011 

average loans including fdicsupported loans were 370 billion and 369 billion in 2012 and 2011 respectively average loans as a percentage of total average assets in 2012 was 695 compared to 718 in the previous year 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and security resell agreements increased by 481 to 79 billion in 2012 compared to 54 billion in 2011 average securities decreased by 194 from 2011 average total deposits increased by 52 while average total loans increased by 04 for 2012 when compared to the prior year increased deposits combined with moderate loan growth resulted in higher balances of excess cash available for money market investments

the amortized cost of investment securities on december 31 2012 decreased by 87 from the balances on december 31 2011 primarily due to reductions in agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities reductions and impairment of assetbacked securities partially offset by increased investments in us treasury securities and mutual funds and other securities       

the amortized cost of investment securities at december 31 2011 decreased by 148 from the previous year this was primarily due to the sale of us treasury securities and reductions in assetbacked securities partially offset by increased investments in sba loanbacked securities 

as of december 31 2012 104 of the 31 billion fair value of availableforsale “afs” securities portfolio was valued at level 1 571 was valued at level 2 and 325 was valued at level 3 under the gaap fair value accounting valuation hierarchy at december 31 2011 50 of the 32 billion fair value of afs securities portfolio was valued at level 1 616 was valued at level 2 and 334 was valued at level 3 see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value accounting 

the amortized cost of afs investment securities valued at level 3 was 1684 million at december 31 2012 and the fair value of these securities was 1004 million the securities valued at level 3 were comprised of abs cdos primarily bank and insurance company trust preferred cdos and municipal securities for these level 3 securities net pretax unrealized loss recognized in oci at december 31 2012 was 680 million as of december 31 2012 we believe that we will receive on settlement or maturity at least the amortized cost   amounts of the level 3 afs securities this expectation applies to both those securities for which otti has been recognized and those for which no otti has been recognized 

schedule 11 presents the company’s cdos according to performing tranches without credit impairment and nonperforming tranches these cdos are the majority of our assetbacked securities and consist of both htm and afs securities

as shown in schedule 12 the company had 36 of its cdo securities representing 424 of the cdo portfolio’s fair value at december 31 2012 that were upgraded by one or more nrsros during the previous 12 months these upgrades were attributed to improvements in overcollateralization ratios and deleveraging combined with less severe rating agency assumptions and methodology

significant assumption changes for 2012 

probability of default of deferring bank holding company trust preferred collateral 

historically our ratiobased valuation model assessed both performing and deferring issuers ratios predictive of bank failure were used in our model to identify the pd of bank holding company issuers of trust preferred securities the reduction of the weighted average assumed loss rate on deferring collateral from 2009 onward was due to a combination of factors these included the increased predictive ability of the model during that period in identifying which holding companies would have its sole bank or primary bank closed by regulators and which did not appear to be in danger of closure bank closures were largely the driver of bank holding company defaults on trust preferred securities during the 2009 to late 2012 period as the highest pd institutions defaulted and relatively stronger new deferrals were added the averages declined for more information about the ratiobased model please refer to note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effective in the fourth quarter of 2012 we developed and began using an additional probability of default overlay model for deferring bank trust preferred issuers we utilized the higher of the pds from the ratiobased model and the pd overlay model thus increasing the pd of deferring issuers the majority of these deferring issuers face a reperformanceordefault deadline within the next two and a half years increased regulatory and restructuring risk as evidenced by several fourth quarter 2012 events and developments led to our modeling change 

prior to the fourth quarter of 2012 we had observed only a few bankruptcies of holding company issuers of trust preferred securities these were generally confined to the weakest institutions thus we assumed no recovery 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2012 several regulatory and restructuring events were observed that negatively affected our assessment of current conditions for those issuers still in deferral and our forecast for these deferrals 

 

 52 

participation by cdo trustees under the direction of collateral managers or noteholders we cannot assume that high levels of participation will be achieved in every future case 

 

 

 

the issuers with the earliest deferrals to which we are exposed will face the end of the allowable deferral period starting in 2013 our fourth quarter 2012 experiences and observations led us to identify greater than previously assessed risk to the collectability of deferring bank holding company issuers even when the underlying bank is not at risk of regulatory closure events seen in the fourth quarter of 2012 indicated that our previous assumption that a well capitalized and profitable bank has a low probability of its bank holding company defaulting should be supplemented with additional analysis said differently the subsidiary of a deferring bank holding company may be in an apparently reasonable financial condition but because cash may be trapped at the subsidiary due to regulatory constraints the bank holding company may simply be unable to bring the trust preferred obligation current once its fiveyear deferral period is up alternatively debt restructurings approved by a cdo collateral manager and section 363 bankruptcies approved by relevant courts may result in losses greater than our previously modeled probabilities of default 

the addition of the “deferral pd overlay model” to our historic ratiobased pd model in the fourth quarter of 2012 addresses these risks by sorting remaining deferrals within our cdo pools into four “buckets” based on four factors indicative of bank holding company strength at the start of their deferral period we then assume that the historical failure rate we have observed within our cdo pool for collateral in each bucket will be the future default rate of current deferrals in each bucket where the overlay pd of a deferral is higher than the pd identified by our traditional ratiobased pd model we use the higher overlay pd we expect to recalibrate the expected default curve for each bucket periodically as the outcome for more deferring issuers becomes known over time 

adoption and utilization of the pd overlay model for deferrals effective december 31 2012 raised our weighted average loss assumption on deferring collateral from 20 under our base model to 49 under the overlay model the assumption change generated 504 million pretax of otti 

assumption changes regarding prepayment rate 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company increased the prepayment assumptions for small banks because of the extent of observed prepayments made by these types of banks the prepayment rate assumption for small banks was increased from 3 per year for each year to 10 per year for three years and 3 thereafter the company expects a few years of this higher prepayment rate as regulatory and economic driven capital restructuring and industry consolidation continues in the near term a period we estimate will continue through 2015 this produced 24 million of otti by itself and another 307 million of otti in combination with pd increases on deferring issuers described previously we changed this assumption because our cdo pools experienced significant and increasing prepayments of small bank trust preferred securities during the latter part of 2012 we define “small banks” as collateral that is not subject to the phasedin disallowance of bank trust preferred securities as tier 1 capital 

required by the doddfrank act the majority of which would be subject to a more lengthy phasedin disallowance under capital rules proposed by the federal reserve and other banking regulators these are primarily banks with assets below 15 billion 

since the third quarter of 2010 we have assumed that large banks with investment grade ratings will fully prepay by the end of 2015 the doddfrank act became effective during the third quarter of 2010 and it phases in the disallowance of the inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier 1 capital for banks with assets over 15 billion “large banks” for those institutions within each pool with investment grade ratings we assume that trust preferred securities will be called prior to the end of the disallowance period the pace of these large bank prepayments to date have been consistent with our assumption with just over 40 of large banks having prepaid within our pools by year end 2012 

given the 10 small bank prepayment rate assumption until the end of 2015 and 3 thereafter and the differing extent of large banks remaining in cdo pools the pool specific prepayment rate until the end of 2015 is calculated with reference to both a the percentage of each pool’s performing collateral consisting of small banks as well as b the percentage which consists of collateral from large banks with investment grade ratings after 2015 each pool is assumed to prepay at a 3 annual rate 

for the fourth quarter of 2012 the resulting average annual prepayment rate assumption for pools which includes both large and small banks is 14 for each year through 2015 followed by an annual prepayment rate assumption of 3 thereafter for pools without large banks we assume a 10 annual prepayment rate for each year through 2015 and 3 thereafter increased prepayment rates are generally favorable for the fair value of the most senior tranches and adverse to the fair value of the more junior tranches 

schedule 13 

effect of bank and insurance cdo assumption changes on otti and fair values 

valuation sensitivity of level 3 bank and insurance cdos 

schedule 14 sets forth the sensitivity of the current internally modeled cdos ’  fair values to changes in the most significant assumptions utilized in the model 

schedule 14 

sensitivity of internal model 



1 the company uses an incurred credit loss model which specifies cumulative losses at the 1year 5year and 30year points from the date of valuation these current and projected losses are reflected in the cdo’s fair value 

 3 the discount rate is a spread over the forward libor curve at the date of valuation 

4 percentage increase is applied to incremental projected loss percentages from currently performing collateral for example the 50 and 100 stress scenarios for afs securities would result in cumulative 30year losses of 408  35350031394 and 463  353100031394 respectively 

5 prepayment rate for small banks increased to 11 per year for the first three years and to 4 per year thereafter through maturity 

 the 2012 sensitivity analysis of valuation assumptions when compared to the same projection for 2011 identifies the impact of the faster prepayment rate assumption change combined with the increased pd assigned to collateral 

remaining in deferral at year end the effect was to increase assumed collateral credit losses in both the short and longterm beyond those projected at 2011 

the discount rates applicable to cdo tranches decreased during the year consistent with observed improved discount rates for riskier assets the result was an increase in the fair values of the cdos 

bank collateral deferral experience 

the company’s loss and recovery experience as of december 31 2012 and our level 3 modeling assumption is essentially a 100 loss on defaults of bank collateral in cdos although we have to date received several generally small recoveries on defaults our experience with deferring bank collateral has been that 50 has defaulted and approximately 30 remains within the allowable deferral period this 30 is comprised of 196 deferring bank holding companies late 2012 events led the company to increase its loss assumptions on these remaining deferrals most of which are more than halfway through their allowable deferral period we expect that future losses on these deferrals may result from actions other than bank failures  primarily bankruptcies and debt restructurings 

in contrast a significant number of previous deferrals have resumed interest payments 71 issuing banks with collateral aggregating to 20 of all deferrals and 40 of all surviving deferrals have either come current and resumed interest payments on their trust preferred securities or have announced that they intend to do so at the next payment date banks may come current on their trust preferred securities for one or more quarters and then redefer this pattern has occurred in seven of the 71 banks which had resumed payment after deferring further information on the company’s valuation process is detailed in note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedules 15 and 16 provide additional information on the belowinvestmentgrade rated bank and insurance trust preferred cdos’ portion of the afs and htm portfolios the schedules reflect data and assumptions that are included in the calculations of fair value and otti the schedules utilize the lowest rating assigned by any rating agency to identify those securities below investment grade the schedules segment the securities by whether or not they have been determined to have otti and by original ratings level to provide granularity on the seniority level of the securities and the distribution of unrealized losses the best and worst poollevel statistic for each original ratings subgroup is presented not the best and worst single security within the original ratings grouping the number of issuers and the number of currently performing issuers noted in schedule 16 are from the same security the remaining statistics may not be from the same security

at december 31 2012 



 

certain original arated securities described in the previous schedule currently have negative subordination and are therefore undercollateralized and yet are not identified as having otti this is because our cash flow projections for these securities show negative subordination being cured prior to the securities’ maturities the collateral that backs a tranche can increase if the more senior liabilities of the cdo decrease this occurs when collateral deterioration due to defaults and deferral triggers alternative waterfall provisions for the cash flow a structural credit protection feature reroutes cash interest collections from the more junior classes of debt and income notes to pay down the principal of the most senior liabilities as the most senior liabilities are paid down while the collateral remains unchanged and if there are no additional unexpected defaults the next level of tranches becomes better secured the rerouting continues to divert cash away from the most junior classes of debt or income notes and gives better security to our tranche our cash flow projections predict full payment of amortized cost and interest 

schedule 17 presents the maturities of the different types of investments that the company owned and the corresponding average yield as of december 31 2012 based on amortized cost it should be noted that most of the sba loanbacked securities and assetbacked securities are variable rate and their repricing periods are significantly less than their contractual maturities see “liquidity risk management” on page 83 and notes 1 5 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s investment securities and their management

nonrated securities 



otherthantemporary impairment – investments in debt securities 

we review investments in debt securities each quarter for the presence of otti for securities where an internal incomebased cash flow model or third party valuation service produces a lossadjusted expected cash flow for the security the presence of otti is identified and the amount of the credit component of otti is calculated by discounting this lossadjusted cash flow at the security specific effective interest rate and comparing that value to the company’s amortized cost of the security 

we review the relevant facts and circumstances each quarter in order to assess our intentions regarding any potential sales of securities as well as the likelihood that we would be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost to date for each security whose fair value is below amortized cost we have determined that we do not intend to sell the security and that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis   we then evaluate the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of each security and identify if any of the difference is due to credit the credit component of the difference is recognized by writing down the amortized cost of each security found to have otti 

for some cdo tranches for which we have previously recorded otti expected future cash flows have remained stable or have slightly improved subsequent to the quarter that otti was identified and recorded for other cdo tranches an adverse change in the expected future cash flow has resulted in the recording of additional otti in both situations while a large difference may remain between fair value and amortized cost the difference is not due to credit the expected future cash flow substantiates the return of the full amortized cost we utilize a present value technique to both identify the otti present in the cdo tranches and to estimate fair value the primary drivers of unrealized losses in these cdos are further discussed in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during 2012 the company recognized creditrelated net impairment losses on cdos of 1041 million compared to losses of 337 million in 2011 schedule 19   identifies the sources of otti

exposure to state and local governments 

the company provides multiple products and services to state and local governments referred together as “municipalities” including deposit services loans investment banking services and the company invests in securities issued by the municipalities 

  

schedule 20 summarizes the company’s exposure to state and local municipalities 

schedule 20 

municipalities 

  

company policy requires that extensions of credit to municipalities be subjected to specific underwriting standards at december 31 2012 one municipality had 9 million of loans that were on nonaccrual a significant amount of the municipal loan and lease portfolio is secured by real estate and equipment and approximately 94 of the outstanding credits were originated by zions bank cbt amegy and vectra see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans 

all municipal securities are reviewed quarterly for otti see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information htm securities consist of unrated bonds issued by small local governmental entities and are purchased through private placements often in situations in which one of the company’s subsidiaries has acted as a financial advisor to the municipality prior to purchase the issuers of municipal securities are evaluated by the company for their creditworthiness and some of the securities are guaranteed by third parties 

of the afs municipal securities 91 are rated by major credit rating agencies and were rated investment grade as of december 31 2012 municipal securities in the trading account are held for resale to customers the company also underwrites municipal bonds and sells most of them to third party investors 

european exposure 

the company is monitoring global economic conditions and is aware of concerns over the creditworthiness of the governments of portugal ireland italy greece and spain the company has not granted loans to and does not own securities issued by these governments and does not have any material exposure to companies or individuals in those countries 

in the normal course of business the company may enter into transactions with subsidiaries of companies and financial institutions headquartered in portugal ireland italy greece or spain such transactions may include deposits loans letters of credit and derivatives as well as foreign currency exchange agreements as of december 31 2012 these transactions did not present any material direct or indirect risk exposure to the company among the derivative transactions the company has a trs agreement with deutsche bank ag “db” with regard to certain bank and insurance trust preferred cdos see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the trs if db were unable to perform under the trs the agreement would terminate at little or no cost to zions there would be only an immaterial balance sheet impact from cancellation and the company would save approximately 54 million in fees quarterly however if the trs were canceled the company would lose the potential future risk mitigation benefits of the trs and regulatory risk weighted assets under the basel i framework would increase by approximately 32 billion which would reduce regulatory riskbased capital ratios by approximately 6 to 7 

loans held for sale 

loans held for sale consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market were 252 million at december 31 2012 compared to 202 million at december 31 2011 consumer loans are primarily fixed rate mortgages that are originated and sold to third parties 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2012 net loans and leases accounted for 679 of total assets compared to 701 at the end of 2011 schedule 21 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2012 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in certain cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 79 

schedule 21 

loan portfolio by type and maturity 

as of december 31 2012 net loans and leases were 377 billion reflecting a 11 increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations as well as a decrease in chargeoffs of existing loans 

most of the loan portfolio growth during 2012 occurred in   commercial and industrial 14 family residential and cre term loans the impact of these increases was partially offset by declines in owner occupied construction and land development loans and fdicsupported loans the loan portfolio increased primarily at amegy nba and vectra while balances declined at zions bank nsb and cbt 

commercial and industrial loans as well as 14 family residential consumer loans improved due to increased customer demand while the increase in commercial real estate term loans was driven in part by construction loans converting to term loans when projects are completed commercial owner occupied loans declined due to active management of the national real estate loan portfolio at zions bank c onstruction and land development loans declined primarily due to paydowns and the completion of construction projects the demand for these types of loans began to increase during 2012 following very weak demand experienced throughout 2011 we expect construction and land development loan balances to increase at a moderate rate in 2013 the balance of fdicsupported loans declined mainly due to paydowns and payoffs and the fact that the company has not purchased additional loans with fdic loss sharing coverage since 2009 and we expect fdicsupported loan balances to decline significantly over the next few years 

loans serviced for the benefit of others amounted to approximately 26   billion and 23 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

foreign loans consist primarily of commercial and industrial loans and totaled 99 million and 46 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

other noninterestbearing investments 

schedule 22 sets forth the company’s other noninterestbearing investments

other noninterestbearing investments 



deposits 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company average total deposits increased by 52 during 2012 with average interestbearing deposits increasing by 01 and average noninterestbearing deposits increasing 147 the increase in noninterestbearing deposits was largely driven by increased deposits from business customers the average interest rate paid for interest bearing deposits was 18 bps lower in 2012 than in 2011 

core deposits at december 31 2012 which exclude time deposits larger than 100000 and brokered deposits increased by 90 or 3688 million from december 31 2011 the increase was mainly due to increases in noninterestbearing and interestbearing demand deposits and savings and money market accounts partially offset by decreases in time deposits 

demand and savings and money market deposits comprised 897 of total deposits at december 31 2012 compared with 884 at december 31 2011 

during 2012 and 2011 the company maintained a low level of brokered deposits with the primary purpose of keeping that funding source available in case of a future need at december 31 2012 total deposits included 37 million of brokered deposits compared to 204 million at december 31 2011 

see notes 10 and 11   of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity risk management” on page 83 for additional information on funding and borrowed funds 

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies credit administration and credit examination 

functions at the parent we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio furthermore an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to management and to the risk oversight committee of the board of directors new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the corporate new product review committee 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each affiliate bank is able to be more conservative in its operations under the corporate credit policy however formal corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to invoke a more liberal policy historically there have been only a limited number of such approvals this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

credit risk associated with counterparties to offbalance sheet credit instruments is generally limited to the hedging of interest rate risk through the use of swaps and futures our subsidiary banks that engage in this activity have isda agreements in place under which derivative transactions are entered into with major derivative dealers each isda agreement details the collateral arrangements between our subsidiaries and their counterparties in every case the amount of the collateral required to secure the exposed party in the derivative transaction is determined by the fair value of the derivative and the credit rating of the party with the obligation some of the counterparties are domiciled in europe however the company’s maximum exposure that is not cash collateralized to any single counterparty was not material as of december 31 2012 

the company’s credit risk management strategy includes diversification of its loan portfolio the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty the company has adopted and adheres to concentration limits on various types of cre lending particularly construction and land development lending leveraged lending municipal lending and lending to the energy sector all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary these concentration limits particularly with regard to various categories of cre and real estate development are materially lower than they were in 2007 and 2008 just prior to the emergence of the recent economic downturn the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers located within the geographical footprint of its banking subsidiaries 

the credit quality of the company’s loan portfolio improved during 2012 nonperforming lendingrelated assets decreased by 299 from december 31 2011 gross chargeoffs for 2012 declined to 267 million from 560 million in the previous year net chargeoffs decreased to 155 million from 456 million for the same periods 

as displayed in schedule 23 commercial and industrial loans were the largest category and constituted 299 of the company’s loan portfolio at december 31 2012 construction and land development loans decreased to 51 of total loans at the end of 2012 compared to 61 at the end of 2011 construction and land development loans have declined significantly from a prerecession level of 201 of total loans at the end of 2007 

schedule 23 

loan portfolio diversification 



fdicsupported loans 

the company’s loan portfolio includes loans that were acquired from failed banks in 2009 alliance bank great basin bank and vineyard bank these loans include nonperforming loans and other loans with characteristics indicative of a high credit risk profile substantially all of these loans are covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic for which the fdic generally will assume 80 of the first 275 million of credit losses for the alliance bank assets 40 million of credit losses for the great basin bank assets 465 million of credit losses for the vineyard bank assets and 95 of the credit losses in excess of those amounts the company does not expect total losses to exceed this higher threshold because acquired loans have performed better than originally expected fdicsupported loans represented 14 and 20 of the company’s total loan portfolio at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively

government agency guaranteed loans 

the company participates in various guaranteed lending programs sponsored by us government agencies such as the small business administration federal housing authority veterans’ administration exportimport bank of the us and the us department of agriculture as of december 31 2012 the principal balance of these loans 

was 590 million and the guaranteed portion was approximately 440 million most of these loans were guaranteed by the small business administration

approximately 33 of the cre term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2012 for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to seven years the remaining 67 of cre loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 15 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include for example criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project loantovalue ratio and occupancy rates 

approximately 28 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2012 consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail apartment office or other projects underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected economics of the project are primary in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily projectswe look for substantial preleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 

although lending for residential construction and development involves a different product type many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity remargining requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan heavy consideration is given to market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered and validated independently of the credit officer and the borrower generally by each bank’s appraisal review function which is staffed by certified appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used appraisals are ordered from outside appraisers at the inception renewal or for cre loans upon the occurrence of any event causing a downgrade to a “criticized” or “classified” designation the frequency for obtaining updated appraisals for these adversely graded credits is increased when declining market conditions exist advance rates on an “as completed basis” will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but the companys guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and spec homes and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally loanbyloan reviews of pass grade loans for all commercial and residential construction and land development loans are performed semiannually at amegy cbt nba nsb vectra and zions bank cbo and cbw perform such reviews annually 

interest reserves are generally established as a loan disbursement budget item for real estate construction or development loans we generally require borrowers to put their equity into the project prior to loan disbursements on these loans this enables the bank to ensure the availability of equity to complete the project the company’s practice is to monitor the construction sales andor leasing progress to determine whether or not the project remains viable if at any time during the life of the credit the project is determined not to be viable including the adequacy of the remaining interest reserves the bank takes appropriate action to protect its collateral position via negotiation andor legal action as deemed necessary at december 31 2012 and 2011 zions’ affiliates had 451 and 356 loans with an outstanding balance of 477 million and 413 million where available interest reserves amounted to 73 million and 36 million respectively in instances where projects have been determined not to be viable the interest reserves and other disbursements have been frozen as appropriate 

we have not been involved to any meaningful extent with insurance arrangements credit derivatives or any other default agreements as a mitigation strategy for cre loans however we do make use of personal or other guarantees as risk mitigation strategies 

cre loans are sometimes modified to increase the likelihood of collecting the maximum possible amount of the company’s investment in the loan in general the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing a loan for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes into consideration this repayment source 

additionally when we modify or extend a loan we give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether a concession has been granted in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists however if additional collateral is obtained or if a strong guarantor exists who is believed to be able and willing to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted 

we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate all personal financial statements of customers entering into new relationships with the applicable bank must not be more than 60 days old on the date the transaction is approved personal financial statements that are required for existing customers must be no more than 15 months old evaluations of the financial strength of the guarantor are performed at least annually 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation performance of other related projects with which we are familiar and willingness to work with us we also utilize market information sources rating and scoring services in our assessment this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance the company estimates previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if at any point in time there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared to the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies 

consumer loans 

the company has mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality its practice historically has been to sell “conforming” fixed rate loans to third parties including fannie mae 

and freddie mac for which it makes representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards it has also been the company’s practice historically to hold variable rate loans in its portfolio the company estimates that it does not have any material financial risk as a result of either its foreclosure practices or loan “putbacks” by fannie mae or freddie mac and has not established any reserves related to these items 

the company has a portfolio of 348 million of stated income mortgage loans with generally high fico® scores at origination including “onetime close” loans to finance the construction of homes which convert into permanent jumbo mortgages as of december 31 2012 approximately 28 million of these loans had refreshed fico® scores of less than 620 these totals exclude heldforsale loans stated income loans account for approximately 38 million or 23 of our credit losses in 14 family residential first mortgage loans during 2012 and were primarily at zions bank and nba 

the company is engaged in home equity credit line “hecl” lending at december 31 2012 the company’s hecl portfolio totaled 22 billion including fdicsupported loans approximately 11 billion of the portfolio is secured by first deeds of trust while the remaining 11 billion is secured by junior liens the outstanding balances and commitments by origination year for the junior lien hecls are presented in schedule 29 

schedule 29 

jr lien hecls – outstanding balances and total commitments 

  

more than 98 of the company’s hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 52 is scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years however most of them are expected to be renewed for a second 10year period after a satisfactory review of the borrower’s credit history and ability to repay the loan of the total home equity credit line portfolio including fdicsupported loans 027 was 90 or more days past due at december 31 2012 as compared to 052 at december 31 2011 during 2012 the company modified 07 million of home equity credit lines the annualized credit losses for the hecl portfolio were 86 and 105 bps for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

as of december 31 2012 loans representing approximately 14 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue ratios “cltv” above 100 an estimated cltv ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateral value the estimated current collateral value is based on projecting values forward from the most recent valuation of the underlying collateral using home price indices at the metropolitan area level generally a valuation of collateral is performed at origination for junior lien hecls the estimated current balance of prior liens is added to the numerator in the calculation of cltv additional detail for the cltv as of december 31 2012 and 2011 is shown in schedule 30 

schedule 30 

hecl portfolio by combined loantovalue 



underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination credit bureau data credit scores and estimated cltv are refreshed on a quarterly basis and are used to monitor and manage accounts including amounts available under the lines of credit the allowance for loan losses is determined through the use of roll rate models and first lien hecls are modeled separately from junior lien hecls see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the allowance 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming lendingrelated assets as a percentage of loans and leases and oreo decreased to 196 at december 31 2012 compared with 283 at december 31 2011 

total nonaccrual loans excluding fdicsupported loans at december 31 2012 decreased by 255 million from the prior year the decrease is primarily due to a 112 million decrease in construction and land development a 36 million decrease in commercial and industrial and a 33 million decrease in commercial owner occupied loans the largest total decreases in nonaccrual loans occurred at amegy nba and vectra 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns chargeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual if a restructured loan performs under the new terms for a period of six months the loan can be considered for return to accrual status see “restructured loans” on page 75 for more information company policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to cre term loans see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

schedule 31 sets forth the company’s nonperforming lendingrelated assets

restructured loans 

tdrs are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties and for which the company has granted a concession that it would not otherwise consider commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such consumer loan tdrs may include firstlien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 

for certain tdrs we split the loan into two new notes – an “a” note and a “b” note the a note is structured to comply with our current lending standards at current market rates and is tailored to suit the customer’s ability to make timely interest and principal payments the b note includes the granting of the concession to the borrower and varies by situation we may defer principal and interest payments until the a note has been paid in full at the time of restructuring the a note is identified and classified as a tdr the b note is chargedoff but the obligation is not forgiven to the borrower and any payments collected on the b notes are accounted for as recoveries the outstanding carrying value of loans restructured using the ab note strategy was approximately 160 million and 171 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

if the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that the company is reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account in determining whether or not a loan should be returned to accrual status 

schedule 32 

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 



in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure company policy requires that the removal of tdr status be approved at the same management level that approves the upgrading of a loan’s classification see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tdrs 

schedule 33 

troubled debt restructured loans rollforward 

  

  

as of december 31 2012  tdr balances reflected recent changes in regulatory interpretative guidance from the occ for national banks whose consumer borrowers had not reaffirmed their debt discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy during the fourth quarter of 2012 we adopted this guidance for all of our subsidiary banks see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other nonperforming assets 

in addition to the lendingrelated nonperforming assets the company had 187 million in fair value and 471 million in amortized cost of investments in debt securities primarily bank and insurance company cdos that were on nonaccrual status at december 31 2012 compared to 124 million and 613 million at december 31 2011 respectively 

allowance and reserve for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

schedule 34 shows the changes in the allowance for loan losses and a summary of loan loss experience 

schedule 34 

summary of loan loss experience 



schedule 35 provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation among the portfolio segments 

schedule 35 

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 



the total alll declined during 2012 by 156 million due to the positive credit trends experienced in our major loan portfolio segments and to somewhat improving economic conditions in some of our markets see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding positive and negative credit trends experienced in each portfolio segment 

the company decreased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to reflect improving credit quality trends and stabilizing economic conditions in some of our markets otherwise there were no significant changes to our qualitative and environmental factors credit trends experienced in the fdicsupported portfolio are also described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the total alll at december 31 2011 decreased by 390 million from the level at yearend 2010 the decreases in the alll for commercial lending cre consumer and fdicsupported loans largely reflected improvements in credit quality and declines in loss rates in each of these major loan portfolio segments although credit quality improved in 2011 the company increased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to keep changes in the level of the alll consistent with continued elevated levels of problem loans and moderate economic growth the decrease in the alll for cre loans also reflected the decrease in loans outstanding for the construction and land development portfolio 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is separately shown in the company’s balance sheet and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are shown separately in the statement of income the reserve increased by 44 million compared to december 31 2011 the increase is primarily due to an increase in unfunded lending commitments see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses   

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company including interest rate and market risk management the boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews limit exceptions reported by management the board 

has established the assetliability committee “alco” consisting of members of management to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the company alco’s primary responsibilities include 

 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have the net interest margin increase slightly in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being slightly “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise the asset sensitivity of the company’s balance sheet changed minimally during 2012 due to the low level of rates and the natural lower bound of zero for market indices there is limited sensitivity to falling rates at the current time our models indicate that decreasing market index rates by 200 bps with a lower bound of 0 would decrease rate sensitive income by approximately 2 over a oneyear period in the income simulation when compared to a scenario of no change in interest rates however if interest rates remain at their current historically low levels given the company’s asset sensitivity it expects its net interest margin to be under continuing modest pressure assuming a stable balance sheet if interest rates remain stable this pressure may lead to a reduction in net interest income unless its impact is offset by sufficient loan growth 

we attempt to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income primarily through the use of interest rate floors on variable rate loans interest rate swaps interest rate futures and by avoiding large exposures to longterm fixed rate interestearning assets that have significant negative convexity our earning assets are largely tied to the shorter end of the interest rate curve the prime lending rate and the libor curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods market value of equity “mve” and income simulation in the mve method we measure the expected changes in the fair values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the income simulation method we analyze the expected changes in income in response to changes in interest rates 

mve is calculated as the fair value of all assets and derivative instruments minus the fair value of liabilities we report changes in the dollar amount of mve for parallel shifts in interest rates 

the company’s policy is generally to limit declines in mve to 3 per 100 bp movement in interest rates in either direction schedule 36 presents the formal limits adopted by the company ’ s board of directors 

schedule 36 

market value of equity decline limits 



these mve limits adopted in late 2012 are a change from the previous policy which imposed limits on duration of equity we had been calculating both measures in parallel for several quarters prior to the adoption of mve as a primary policy limit and no significant change in the company’s interest rate risk position resulted from this policy change further we still calculate and monitor both measures duration measures changes in mve for small changes in interest rates only the changes to the policy to limit declines in mve over a wider range of rate movements enhanced the interest rate risk management practice of the company changes to the mve limits are subject to notification and approval by the company’s board of directors due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk changes in mve can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes examples of such risks may include outofthemoney caps on loans which have little effect for small rate movements but may become important if larger rate shocks were to occur or substantial prepayment deceleration for low rate mortgages in a higher rate environment 

income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income and total rate sensitive income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income and total rate sensitive income are measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio for income simulation company policy requires that interest sensitive income from a static balance sheet be limited to a decline of no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps 

  

each of these measurement methods requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of mve and income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is actively managed to maintain an assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

the estimated mve and income simulation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking and savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these estimates we view both the mve and the income simulation results as falling within a wide range of possibilities 

as of the dates indicated schedule 37 shows the company’s percentage change in interest rate sensitive income based on a static balance sheet in the first year after the rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from 200 bps to 500 bps the company estimates interest rate risk with two sets of deposit repricing scenarios 

the first scenario assumes that administeredrate deposits money market interestearning checking and savings reprice at a faster speed in response to changes in interest rates additionally interest rates cannot decline below zero at december 31 2012 interest rates were at such a low level that repricing scenarios assuming 100 bps and 200 bps rate shocks produced similar results 

the second scenario assumes that those deposits reprice at a slower speed for larger rate shocks eg 500 bps models reflecting consumer behavior in regards to both loan prepayments and deposit runoff are inherently prone to increased model uncertainty 

schedule 37 

income simulationchange in interest rate sensitive income 





schedule 38 includes changes in the mve from 200 bps to 500 bps parallel rate moves for both “fast” and “slow” scenarios 

schedule 38 

changes in market value of equity 





during 2012 changes in interest rate sensitivity were primarily driven by a 146 yearoveryear increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits with the majority of that increase being invested in shortterm money market assets other factors which marginally affected the changes in interest rate sensitivity include the redemption of tarp preferred stock from cash reserves changes in the modeling assumptions for capturing balloon payments and changes to prepayment assumptions 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at the end of 2012 and 2011 approximately 77 and 76 respectively of the company’s commercial lending and cre portfolios were variable rate and primarily tied to either the prime rate or   

libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have variable interest rates see schedule 21 for further information on fixed and variable interest rates of the loan portfolio 

largely due to competitive pressures the company’s subsidiary banks have decreased the use of interest rate floors on new loans as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 approximately 375   and 458 of all of the company’s variable rate loan balances contain floors of the loans with floors approximately  744  and 779 of the balances at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively were priced at the floor rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 107    and 122 respectively 

at december 31 2012 the company held 150 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements all of which will mature in 2013 see notes 7 and 20   of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

market risk – fixed income 

the company engages in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities this trading activity exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2012 the company had 28 million of trading assets and 27 million of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 40 million and 44 million respectively at the end of the prior year 

during the third quarter of 2012 the company exited the business of trading corporate debt securities in preparation for the expected implementation of the volcker rule of the doddfrank act we do not expect this change to have a material impact on the company’s future earnings 

the company is exposed to market risk through changes in fair value the company is also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in aoci for each financial reporting period during 2012 the aftertax change in aoci attributable to afs and htm securities was an increase of 149 million compared to a 93 million decrease in 2011 the decrease attributable to cash flow interest rate swaps was 8 million in 2012 and 21 million in 2011 if any of the afs or htm securities becomes otherthantemporarily impaired the credit impairment is charged to operations see “investment securities portfolio” on page 49 for additional information on otti 

market risk – equity investments 

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded in addition the company owns equity securities in companies and governmental entities eg federal reserve bank and federal home loan banks that are not publicly traded and which are accounted for under cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs regardless of the accounting method the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since the fair value of these securities may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss equity investments in private and public companies are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

the company holds investments in prepublic companies through various venture capital funds the company’s equity exposure to these investments was approximately 56 million and 49 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

 additionally amegy has an alternative investments portfolio these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds were generally not a part of the strategy since the underlying companies were typically not creditworthy the carrying value of amegy ’ s equity investments was 60 million and 71 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company had a total remaining funding commitment of 32 million   and 44 

million respectively to sbic nonsbic funds and private equity investments of these commitments approximately 22 million and 29 million respectively were at amegy 

these private equity investments are subject to the provisions of the doddfrank act that prohibit bank holding company or bank investment in such funds with limited exceptions the company is allowed to honor unfunded commitments made prior to the adoption of the doddfrank act but is not allowed to make any new commitments to invest in private equity except for sbic funds therefore the company ’ s earnings from these investments and the potential volatility of these earnings are expected to decline over the next several years and will ultimately cease 

liquidity risk management 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt and capital service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary bank levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines for example the “time to required funding” and fixed charges coverage ratios that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and bank subsidiaries as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the parent and bank liquidity 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally by zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the policy guidelines these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco the subsidiary banks have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and the federal reserve and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank andor correspondent banks the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer 

contractual obligations 

schedule 39 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2012 

schedule 39 

contractual obligations 



 

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 39 the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of its business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative contracts 

liquidity management actions 

consolidated cash and interestbearing deposits held as investments at the parent and its subsidiaries decreased to 78 billion at december 31 2012  from 82 billion at december 31 2011  the decrease during 2012 resulted from 1 the redemption of the 14 billion series d fixedrate cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued to the us department of the treasury under its troubled asset relief program “tarp” capital purchase program “cpp” 2 the payment of common and preferred dividends 3 the purchase of additional security resell agreements and 4 the net funding of new loans these decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash due to an increase in deposits the issuance of longterm debt net of repayments and net cash provided by operating activities 

parent company liquidity    the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders 

including the tarp preferred stock until it was redeemed in september 2012 the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes equity contributed through the exercise of stock options and longterm debt and equity issuances 

during 2012 the parent redeemed its 14 billion tarp preferred stock and purchased 575 million of security resell agreements these uses of cash were partially offset by dividends received from its subsidiaries and the redemption of subsidiary preferred stock issued to the parent as a result of these capital actions cash and interestbearing deposits held as investments at the parent decreased to 78 million at december 31 2012  from 956 million at december 31 2011  

during 2012  the parent received common dividends totaling 1816 million and preferred dividends totaling 650 million from its subsidiary banks and common dividends totaling 554 million from nonbank subsidiaries also the parent received cash of 7691 million from its subsidiary banks as a result of the redemption of preferred stock issued to the parent during 2011 the parent received 1819 million from bank and nonbank subsidiaries for common and preferred dividends and the redemption of preferred stock issued to the parent the dividends that our subsidiary banks can pay to the parent are restricted by current and historical earning levels retained earnings and riskbased and other regulatory capital requirements and limitations during 2012  all of the company’s subsidiary banks except tcbo recorded a profit we expect that this profitability will be sustained thus permitting additional payments of dividends by the subsidiaries to the parent andor returns of capital to the parent during 2013 see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of dividend capacities and limitations 

during 2012 and 2011 the company has held the dividend on its common stock to 001 per share per quarter to conserve both capital and cash at the parent 

during 2012 the company adopted several new policy limits that govern liquidity risk most importantly it adopted a target for the parent ’ s timetorequired funding of 1824 months with a minimum policy limit of 12 months as of december 31 2012 and throughout 2012 the company exceeded these policy limits 

general financial market and economic conditions impact the company’s access to and cost of external financing and continued to improve during 2012  access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is also directly affected by the credit ratings they receive from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the debt ratings and outlooks issued by the various rating agencies for the company did not change during 2012  except for moody’s senior debt rating which improved to ba1 from ba3 moody’s subordinated debt rating which improved to ba2 from b1 and fitch’s outlook which improved to positive from stable while moody’s rates the company’s senior debt as ba1 or noninvestment grade standard  poor’s fitch dominion bond rating service “dbrs” and kroll all rate the company’s senior debt at a low investment grade level in addition all five rating agencies rate the company’s subordinated debt as noninvestment grade

during 2012  and 2011  the parent’s operating expenses included cash payments for interest of approximately 124 million and 127 million respectively additionally the parent paid approximately 134 million and 156 million of dividends on preferred stock and common stock respectively for the same periods preferred stock dividends decreased in 2012 as a result of the redemption of the 14 billion tarp preferred stock and the replacement of the 110 series e preferred stock with the 79 series f preferred stock 

the company’s cash receipts from subsidiaries and investments covered the parent’s interest and dividend payments during 2012 and are expected to cover them in 2013 note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and cash flows for 2012 2011 and 2010 as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2012 and 2011 

repayments of shortterm borrowings by the parent exceeded new issuances which resulted in net cash outflows of 111 million during 2012  

at december 31 2012  maturities of the company’s longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from february 2013 to november 2019 with interest rates from 20 to 775 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of the company’s longterm debt 

subsidiary bank liquidity  the subsidiary banks’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2012  these core deposits excluding brokered deposits in aggregate constituted 966 of consolidated deposits compared with 954 at december 31 2011  on a consolidated basis the company’s net loan to total deposit ratio is at a recent historical low of 816 as of december 31 2012  compared to 869 as of december 31 2011  

total deposits increased by 33 billion during 2012  mainly due to increases of 24 billion in noninterestbearing demand deposits and 11 billion in savings and money market deposits partly offset by a decrease of 451 million 

in time deposits also during 2012 the subsidiary banks’ investment in security resell agreements increased by 21 billion at least partially funded by this significant increase in deposits 

the fdic rule providing temporary unlimited insurance coverage for noninterestbearing transaction accounts at all fdicinsured depository institutions expired on december 31 2012 deposits held in noninterestbearing transaction accounts are now aggregated with any interestbearing deposits the owner may hold and the combined total is insured up to 250000 

the fhlb system and federal reserve banks have been and are a source of backup liquidity and from time to time a significant source of funding and backup liquidity for each of the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank tcbw and tcbo are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nba are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy bank is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity requirements the subsidiary banks are required to invest in fhlb stock to maintain their borrowing capacity at december 31 2012  the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 144 billion loans with a carrying value of approximately 211 billion at both december 31 2012  and 2011 have been pledged at the federal reserve and various fhlbs as collateral for current and potential borrowings at december 31 2012  the company had a de minimus amount of longterm borrowings outstanding with the fhlb – approximately 23 million which decreased slightly from 24 million at december 31 2011  at december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  the subsidiary banks’ total investment in fhlb stock was approximately 109 million and 116 million respectively 

the company’s investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture that is taken during 2012  investment securities’ activities resulted in a decrease in investment securities holdings and a net increase of cash in the amount of 322 million 

maturing balances in our subsidiary banks’ loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows lending activity for 2012  resulted in a net cash outflow of 08 billion compared to a net cash outflow of 12 billion for 2011  

during 2012 the company paid income taxes of 183 million compared to 4 million during 2011 

operational risk management 

operational risk is the potential for unexpected losses attributable to human error systems failures fraud or inadequate internal controls and procedures in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has a corporate risk management department whose responsibility is to help management identify and assess key risks and monitor the key internal controls and processes that the company has in place to mitigate operational risk we have documented controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

to manage and minimize its operating risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud penetrate the company’s systems or telecommunications access customer data andor deny normal access to those systems to the company’s legitimate customers regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments in addition reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we maintain contingency plans and systems for operations support in the event of natural or other disasters 

efforts are continually underway to improve the company’s oversight of operational risk including enhancement of riskcontrol self assessments and antifraud measures which are reported to the enterprise risk management committee and to the risk oversight committee of the board we also mitigate operational risk through the 

purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance however the number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate the company’s critical systems sometimes referred to as hacking cyberfraud cyberattacks cyberterrorism or other similar names also continues to grow on a daily basis the company its customers and other financial institutions are subject to such attempts the company has established systems and procedures to monitor thwart or mitigate damage from such attempts and usually these efforts have been successful however in some instances we or our customers have been victimized by cyberfraud related losses to the company have not been material or some of our customers have been temporarily unable to routinely access our online systems as a result of for example distributed denial of service attacks 

capital management 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary banks other major cmc responsibilities include 

 the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

 in addition the cmc oversees the company’s capital stress testing under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios the company has established processes to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the company under hypothetical economic scenarios these stress tests facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity including quantitative limits reflecting the board of directors’ risk appetite these processes are also used to conduct the stress testing required by the federal reserve as part of the company ’ s capital plan review process 

filing a capital plan with the federal reserve based on stresstesting and documented sound policies processes models and governance practices and the subsequent review by the federal reserve is an annual regulatory requirement this capital plan which is subject to objection by the federal reserve governs all of the company’s capital and significant unsecured debt financing actions for a period of five quarters among the actions governed by the capital plan are the repurchase of outstanding capital securities and the timing of new capital issuances and whether the company can pay or increase dividends any such action not included in a capital plan to which the federal reserve has not objected cannot be executed without submission of a revised stress test and capital plan 

for federal reserve review and nonobjection de minimus changes are allowed without a complete plan resubmission subject to receipt of a federal reserve nonobjection additionally the federal reserve has proposed regulations requiring future results of these stress tests to be disclosed which may influence bank regulatory supervisory requirements concerning the company and impact the amount or timing of dividends or distributions to the company’s shareholders the company submitted its 2013 capital plan to the federal reserve on january 7 2013 and does not expect to receive a nonobjectionobjection decision from the federal reserve until midmarch 

controlling interest shareholders’ equity decreased by 134 from 70 billion at december 31 2011 to 61 billion at december 31 2012 the decrease in controlling interest shareholders’ equity from december 31 2011 is primarily due to the redemption of the 14 billion of tarp preferred stock and 1336 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock partially offset by 3495 million of net income applicable to controlling interest 896 million of convertible subordinated debt converted to preferred stock and 1488 million improvement in net unrealized losses on investment securities recorded in aoci the company redeemed its tarp preferred stock in two installments of 700 million each on march 28 2012 and september 26 2012 the improvement in net unrealized losses on investment securities in 2012 was primarily a result of improvement in the discount rates on riskier assets and favorable changes in certain cdo tranche collateralization levels and the recognition of otti in the statement of income 

note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information on riskbased capital in addition “liquidity risk management” on page 83 and notes 12 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discuss the company’s debt and equity transactions during 2012   

the company paid 74 million in dividends on common stock in both 2012  and 2011 the dividends paid per share of 001 each quarter in 2012 were unchanged from the rate paid since the third quarter of 2009 

the company recorded preferred stock dividends of 1709 million and 1704 million during 2012  and 2011  respectively preferred dividends for 2012  and 2011  include 791 million and 916 million respectively related to the tarp preferred stock consisting of cash payments of 344 million and 700 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively and accretion of 447 million and 216 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively for the difference between the fair value and par amount of the tarp preferred stock when issued 

conversions of convertible subordinated debt into preferred stock have augmented the company’s capital position and reduced future debt refinancing needs from the original modification in june 2009 through december 31 2012  752 million of debt has been extinguished and 878 million of preferred capital has been added as a result of these conversions schedule 42 shows the effect the conversions have had on tier 1 capital and outstanding convertible subordinated debt 

schedule 42 

impact of convertible subordinated debt 



as of december 31 2012 and 2011 our preferred stock balance included 126 million and 111 million respectively related to the beneficial conversion feature as shown in schedule 42 a portion of the beneficial conversion feature is reclassified from common stock to preferred stock upon each conversion of convertible subordinated debt into preferred stock in the event that the series c preferred stock were to be redeemed the 126 million would be reclassified into common equity note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains further information related to the beneficial conversion feature 

on may 7 2012 the company issued 14375 million of a new series of tier 1 capital qualifying perpetual preferred stock at a dividend of 79 the proceeds were used to redeem all outstanding shares of its series e fixedrate resettable noncumulative perpetual preferred stock on june 15 2012 the series e securities had an aggregate par amount of 1425 million and current dividend of 110 the issuance of the new series f preferred stock and redemption of the series e preferred stock will reduce preferred stock dividends paid by the company by approximately 43 million per year 

banking organizations are required by capital regulations to maintain capital levels in excess of certain minimum standards as measured by several regulatory capital ratios the company’s capital ratios as of december 31 2012  are shown in schedule 43 the company is in compliance with all currently applicable capital requirements 

schedule 43 

capital and performance ratios 



  

at december 31 2012  regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital were 5884 million and 6617 million respectively compared to 6946 million and 7780 million at december 31 2011  

in june 2012 the frb occ and fdic collectively the agencies each issued notices of proposed rulemaking “nprs” that would revise and replace the agencies’ current regulatory capital rules to align with the june 2011 bank for international settlements regulatory framework commonly referred to as basel iii these capital standards meet certain requirements of the doddfrank act requirements included in the proposed nprs would establish more restrictive capital definitions higher riskweightings for certain asset classes capital buffers higher minimum capital ratios and new “prompt corrective action” triggers and restrictions the revisions include revised methodologies for determining riskweighted assets for residential mortgages unused loan commitments securitization exposures nonperforming assets and counterparty credit risk we are currently evaluating the impact of the proposed nprs on our regulatory capital ratios while uncertainty exist as to the final form of the us rules implementing the basel iii capital framework we expect to meet the final requirements adopted by us banking regulators within regulatory timelines 

subsequent to december 31 2012 the company expects to execute several capital actions that should significantly reduce the cost of its capital and financing structure on february 4 2013 the company filed a prospectus supplement for the issuance of 172 million of its fixedfloating rate 630 for the first ten years series g preferred stock redeemable on march 15 2023 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

1 common equity tier 1 capital 

traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulators have assessed a bank’s capital adequacy based on tier 1 capital the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations regulators have begun supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier 1 capital known as common equity tier 1 capital the common equity tier 1 capital ratio is the core capital component of the basel iii standards and we believe that it increasingly is becoming a key ratio considered by regulators investors and analysts there is a difference between this ratio calculated using basel i definitions of common equity tier 1 capital and those definitions using basel iii rules when fully phased in which have not yet been formalized in regulation the common equity tier 1 riskbased capital ratios in schedule 43 use the current basel i definitions for determining the numerator because common equity tier 1 capital is not formally defined by gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure and other entities may calculate them differently than the company’s disclosed calculations since banking regulators investors and analysts may assess the company’s capital adequacy using common equity tier 1 capital we believe it is useful to provide them the ability to assess the company’s capital adequacy on this same basis 

common equity tier 1 capital is often expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets under the current riskbased capital framework a bank’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of offbalance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad “basel i” risk categories for banks like our banking subsidiaries that have not adopted the basel ii “advanced measurement approach” the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the riskweighted assets total that as adjusted comprises the denominator of certain riskbased capital ratios tier 1 capital is then divided by this denominator riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 capital ratio adjustments are made to tier 1 capital to arrive at common equity tier 1 capital common equity tier 1 capital is also divided by the riskweighted assets to determine the common equity tier 1 capital ratio the amounts disclosed as riskweighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements

for items 2 3 and 4 the identified adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are included where applicable in financial results or in the balance sheet presented in accordance with gaap we consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and financial position 

we believe that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the nongaap financial measures provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which will assist regulators investors and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the company and in predicting future performance these nongaap financial measures are used by management and the board of directors to assess the performance of the company’s business or its financial position for evaluating bank reporting segment performance for presentations of the company’s performance to investors and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts we further believe that presenting these nongaap financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management and the board of directors 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap

competition 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks credit unions and thrifts including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies and a variety of other types of companies many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include pricing convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered and the level of service delivered the company must compete effectively along all of these parameters to remain successful 

  

supervision and regulation 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended among other things to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers including depositors these regulations are not however generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the company the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the company 

the parent is a bank holding company and a financial holding company as provided by the glb act the bhc act and other federal statutes as modified by the glb act and the doddfrank act provide the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the frb the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a bank holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator and the laws and regulations administered by those regulators the glb act allows our bank subsidiaries to engage in certain financial activities through financial subsidiaries to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company or to do business through a financial subsidiary the parent and its subsidiary banks must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required 

the parent’s subsidiary banks and wntc are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or other statutes governing national banks and the banking laws of their various states as well as the rules and regulations of the occ the frb and the fdic they are also under the supervision of and are continually subject to periodic examination and supervision by the occ or their respective state banking departments the frb and the fdic many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other federal and state agencies these bank regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination role our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the sec finra andor state securities regulators 

the doddfrank act 

the events of the past few years have led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” or “doddfrank” which was enacted in july 2010 is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the united states 

the doddfrank act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities requiring ongoing stress testing of our capital mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements increasing regulation of executive and incentivebased compensation requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector among other things affecting capital standards the doddfrank act provides that 

 

  

  

 these provisions will require us to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets and will limit the forms of capital that we will be able to rely upon for regulatory purposes for example provisions of the dodd 

  

frank act require us to deduct all trust preferred securities from our tier 1 capital over a threeyear phasein period beginning january 1 2013 in addition in their supervisory role with respect to our stress testing and capital planning the bank regulatory agencies may effectively regulate certain of our capitalrelated actions such as dividends and stock repurchases 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and pricing of certain products and services including the following 

 

  

  

 the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act adds prohibitions on unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the cfpb the cfpb was recently established and its impact on our subsidiary banks remains uncertain the doddfrank act subjected national banks to further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws which enabled national banks and their subsidiaries to comply with federal regulatory requirements without complying with various state laws in addition the act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

the doddfrank act contains numerous provisions that limit or place significant burdens and costs on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds for the affected activities these provisions may result in increased compliance and other costs increased legal risk and decreased scope of product offerings 

in october 2011 and january 2012 federal regulators published for comment proposed regulations to implement the socalled “volcker rule” of the doddfrank act which would significantly restrict certain activities by covered bank holding companies including restrictions on proprietary trading and private equity investing the public comment period on these proposed regulations has ended but a final rule has not yet been published 

the company and other companies subject to the doddfrank act is being subjected to a number of requirements regarding the time manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules these requirements generally implement the compensation restrictions imposed by the doddfrank act and include documentation and governance deferral and clawback requirements 

as discussed further throughout this section many aspects of doddfrank are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company or the industry more than half of the total regulations to implement the doddfrank act have not yet been published for comment or adopted in final form 

individually and collectively these proposed regulations resulting from the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

capital standards – basel framework 

the frb has established capital guidelines for financial holding companies the occ the fdic and the frb have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks these bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the bcbs the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply 

in 2004 the bcbs proposed a new capital accord “basel ii” to replace basel i basel ii provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk—an advanced internal ratingsbased approach tailored to individual institutions’ circumstances and a standardized approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in existing guidelines basel ii also sets capital requirements for operational risk and refines the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures 

in december 2007 us banking regulators published the final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approaches of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” the parent is not required to comply with basel ii in july 2008 the agencies issued a proposed rule that would give banking organizations that do not use the advanced approaches the option to implement a new riskbased capital framework which would adopt the standardized approach of basel ii for credit risk the basic indicator approach of basel ii for operational risk and related disclosure requirements a definitive rule has not been issued 

in december 2010 the bcbs released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation now officially identified by the bcbs as “basel iii” basel iii when implemented by the us banking agencies and fully phasedin will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common equity the basel iii final capital framework among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the implementation of the basel iii final framework is expected to commence january 1 2013 however the frb has not yet released proposed regulations to implement the basel iii capital framework in the united states such proposed regulations are expected in the first half of 2012 

stress testing prudential standards and early remediation 

in november 2011 the company was given instructions requiring its participation in the frb’s 2012 comprehensive capital analysis and review which implemented the doddfrank act requirement that all bank holding companies with assets greater than 50 billion be subject to an annual frb stress test the company timely submitted its capital plan pursuant to this process on january 9 2012 in this capital plan the company was required to forecast under a variety of economic scenarios for nine quarters ending the fourth quarter of 2013 its estimated regulatory capital ratios under basel i rules its tier 1 common ratio under basel i rules the same ratios under basel iii rules and its gaap tangible common equity ratio as noted implementing regulations that define how many of these ratios are to be calculated by us institutions have not been published for comment or adopted under the implementing regulations a bank holding company may generally pay dividends and repurchase stock only under a capital plan as to which the frb has not objected 

in december 2011 the frb published new proposed regulations entitled “enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements for covered companies” which if adopted also would apply to all bank holding companies with assets greater than 50 billion the comment period on these proposed regulations expires march 31 2012 these proposed regulations would implement many of the proposed aspects of the basel iii capital and liquidity regime and the doddfrank act stress test requirements including public disclosure of results and would specify conditions under which a bank holding company would be placed under enhanced nonpublic or public supervision and restrictions however the proposed regulations did not specify how basel iii capital ratio calculations will be defined in the united states the proposed regulations would also require each covered institution to establish a risk committee of its board of directors that would include a “risk expert” 

other regulation 

the company is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank act and other federal and state laws and regulations which address among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a comprehensive system of corporate governance practices this system includes corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct a related party transaction policy stock ownership and retention guidelines an excessive and luxury expenditure policy a compensation clawback policy and charters for the audit risk oversight executive compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit the tools available to the frb which may be used to implement monetary policy include 

 

  

  

  

  

 these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

  

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company’s board of directors has established a risk oversight committee and an enterprise risk management policy and has appointed an enterprise risk management committee to oversee and implement the policy in addition to credit and interest rate risk the committee also monitors the following risk areas market risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk information technology risk strategic risk compensationrelated risk and reputation risk 

the following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the company including but not limited to 

the company has been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

the united states and many other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected and are likely to continue for some time to adversely affect the company’s assets including its loans and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition in response to the economic crisis the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis these programs and policies appear to have stabilized in the united states the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of 2008 but adverse economic conditions continue to exist in the united states and globally concerns about the european union’s sovereign debt crisis have continued to cause uncertainty for financial markets globally it is possible economic conditions may again become more severe or that adverse economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time in addition economic uncertainty resulting from possible changes in the ratings of sovereign debt issued by the united states and other nations and fiscal imbalances in the united states at federal state and municipal levels in the european union and in other countries combined with political difficulties in resolving these imbalances may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic conditions faced by the company and its customers any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions including a doubledip recession or delay a full economic recovery would adversely affect the company 

our information systems may experience an interruption or security breach 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

the regulation of incentive compensation under the doddfrank act the eesa and the arra may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

the bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel in addition because we have not yet repurchased the 

  

us treasury’s cpp investment we remain subject to the strict restrictions on incentive compensation contained in the arra financial institutions which have repurchased the us treasury’s cpp investment are relieved of the restrictions imposed by the arra due to these restrictions we may not be able to successfully compete with financial institutions that have repurchased the us treasury’s investment to attract retain and appropriately incentivize high performing employees in addition bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

stress testing and capital management under doddfrank as well as the terms of the us treasury’s cpp investment limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the capital markets 

under emerging stress testing and capital management standards being developed by bank regulatory agencies under doddfrank as well as the terms of the us treasury’s cpp investment in us the bank regulatory agencies have additional authority and processes to require us to limit our dividends repurchases of common stock and access to capital markets for certain types of capital among other things any increase in quarterly dividends not contemplated in our annual capital plan will require frb approval these limitations may adversely impact the company’s ability to attract nongovernmental capital 

we have been unprofitable in two of the last three years and could potentially be unprofitable in the future and such lack of profitability could have particular adverse effects on us such as restricting our ability to pay dividends or requiring a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 

we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its banking and other subsidiaries as a result our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock will depend primarily upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries we and certain of our subsidiaries have been unprofitable during the two of the last three annual reporting periods during the last three years the noncash accelerated discount amortization expense caused by subordinated debt holders converting their debt to preferred stock has contributed to our lack of profitability future conversions of subordinated debt into preferred stock may continue to hurt our profitability the ability of the company and our subsidiary banks to pay dividends is restricted by regulatory requirements including profitability and the need to maintain required levels of capital lack of profitability exposes us to the risk that regulators could restrict the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends and our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock preferred stock or trust preferred securities it also increases the risk that the company may have to establish a “valuation allowance” against its net dta some of the company’s subsidiary banks have disallowed a portion of their dta for regulatory capital purposes 

the doddfrank act imposes significant new limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank act has material implications for the company and the entire financial services industry the act places significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions including the company with more than 50 billion of assets in addition among other things the act will or potentially could 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 because the responsible agencies are still in the process of proposing and finalizing regulations required under doddfrank the full impact of this legislation on the company its business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for some time individually and collectively these proposed regulations resulting from the doddfrank act may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

us regulatory agencies in response to the adoption of basel iii and title i of the doddfrank act will require us to raise our capital and liquidity to levels that may exceed those that the market considers to be optimal 

basel iii was adopted in december 2010 by the bcbs and provides an international framework for the establishment of bank capital standards title i of the doddfrank act requires that banking organizations of our size undergo regular stress testing of their capital assets and profitability and authorizes bank regulatory agencies to promulgate new capital and liquidity standards new capital and liquidity requirements are being developed by us regulatory agencies in response to basel iii and doddfrank which are higher than previous levels maintaining higher capital and liquidity levels may reduce our profitability and performance measures 

economic and other circumstances including pressure to repay cpp preferred stock may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

the company’s subsidiary banks must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by their banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions and their particular condition risk profile and growth plans compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require capital investment from the parent in 2008 we issued shares of preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of the company’s common stock to the us treasury for 14 billion under tarp there may be increasing market regulatory or political pressure on the company to raise capital to enable it to repay the preferred stock issued to the us treasury under tarp at a time or in amounts that may be unfavorable to the company’s shareholders these uncertainties and risks created by the legislative and regulatory uncertainties discussed above may themselves increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

negative perceptions associated with our continued participation in the us treasury’s cpp may adversely affect our ability to retain customers attract investors and compete for new business opportunities 

several financial institutions that also participated in the cpp have repurchased their tarp preferred stock there can be no assurance as to the timing or manner in which the company may repurchase its series d preferred stock from the us treasury our customers employees and counterparties in our current and future business relationships could draw negative implications regarding the strength of the company as a financial institution based on our continued participation in the cpp any such negative perceptions could impair our 

  

ability to effectively compete with other financial institutions for business or to retain high performing employees if this were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

credit quality has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks although most credit quality indicators continued to improve during 2011 the company’s credit quality may continue to show weakness in some loan types and markets in which the company operates in 2012 as the economic recovery progresses 

failure to effectively manage our credit concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect us 

increases in concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the company concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the company due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion the management of concentration risk is centralized and overseen by the corporate concentration risk committee which routinely analyzes aggregate exposure industries and correlations counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk but it is routinely monitored and analyzed 

weakness in the economy and in the real estate market including specific weakness within the markets where our subsidiary banks do business and within certain of our loan products has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

credit exposure is one of our most significant risks the company’s level of problem credits remained relatively high as of december 31 2011 the deterioration in credit quality that started in the latter half of 2007 has most significantly affected the construction and land development segment of our portfolio although virtually all of our markets and lending segments have been adversely affected by the economic recession the distress has been mostly concentrated in construction and land development loans in the southwest states generally arizona california and nevada which markets have been particularly adversely affected by job losses declines in residential and commercial sale volumes and real estate values and declines in new construction activity 

if the strength of the us economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we and our subsidiary banks conduct operations decline further this could result in among other things further deterioration in credit quality andor continued reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses if such developments occur we may be required to raise additional capital 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue the management of interest rate risk for the company and all bank subsidiaries is centralized and overseen by an asset liability management committee appointed by the company’s board of directors we have been successful in our interest rate risk management as evidenced by achieving a relatively stable net interest margin over the last several years when interest rates have been volatile and the rate environment challenging however a failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates subject to general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

the frb has stated its expectations that shortterm interest rates may remain low through late 2014 such a scenario may continue to create or exacerbate margin compression for us as a result of repricing of longerterm loans 

  

our ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity has been and may continue to be adversely affected by market conditions 

we are required to maintain certain capital levels in accordance with banking regulations and any capital requirements imposed by our regulators we must also maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support our operations and fund outstanding liabilities our ability to maintain capital levels sources of funding and liquidity has been and could continue to be impacted by changes in the capital markets in which we operate and deteriorating economic and market conditions 

each of our subsidiary banks must remain wellcapitalized and meet certain other requirements for us to retain our status as a financial holding company failure to comply with those requirements could result in a loss of our financial holding company status if such conditions are not corrected within 180 days or such longer period as may be permitted by the frb although we do not believe that the loss of such status would have an appreciable effect on our operations or financial results in addition failure by our bank subsidiaries to meet applicable capital guidelines or to satisfy certain other regulatory requirements can result in certain activity restrictions or a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities that include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic 

funding availability continued to improve during 2011 however because liquidity stresses are often a consequence of the occurrence of other risks they will continue to be a risk factor in 2012 and beyond for the company the parent and its affiliate banks 

the quality and liquidity of our assetbacked investment securities portfolio has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

the company’s assetbacked investment securities portfolio includes cdos collateralized by trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies insurance companies and reits that may have some exposure to construction loan commercial real estate and the subprime markets andor to other categories of distressed assets in addition assetbacked securities also include structured assetbacked cdos also known as diversified structured finance cdos which have exposure to subprime and home equity mortgage securitizations factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the fair value and impairment status of these securities these factors include but are not limited to defaults deferrals and restructurings by debt issuers rating agency downgrades of securities lack of market pricing of securities or the return of market pricing that varies from the company’s current model valuations and changes in prepayment rates and future interest rates see “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 for further details 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us certain of our affiliates and particular classes of securities that we and our affiliates issue the interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we our affiliates andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies in the past rating agencies have downgraded our credit ratings further downgrades to us our affiliates or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the level of regulatorycompliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions the administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the company to comply before their formal adoption 

  

the company provides to its customers and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements therefore pose an ongoing risk 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

the company is subject to risks associated with legal claims fines litigation and regulatory proceedings the company’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the current economic environment new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes and the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations 

we could be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions 

from time to time the company makes acquisitions including the acquisition of assets and liabilities of failed banks from the fdic acting as a receiver the fdicsupported transactions are subject to loan loss sharing agreements failure to comply with the terms of the agreements could result in the loss of indemnification from the fdic the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the projected cost savings from the acquisition and on the continued growth and profitability of the acquisition target we have been successful with most prior acquisitions but it is possible that the merger integration process with an acquired company could result in the loss of key employees disruptions in controls procedures and policies or other factors that could affect our ability to realize the projected savings and successfully retain and grow the target’s customer base

executive summary 

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 53 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is a “systemically important” financial institution under the doddfrank act 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 longterm strategy 

we strive to maintain a local community bank approach for customerfacing elements of our business we believe that our target customers consisting largely of small and midsized businesses appreciate local branding product customization and speedy decisionmaking by local management by retaining a significant degree of autonomy in product offerings and pricing we believe our banks have a sustainable competitive advantage over larger national banks where loan and deposit products are often homogeneous however we strive to centralize noncustomer facing operations such as risk and capital management technology and operations by centralizing many of these functions we believe we can generally achieve greater economies of scale and stronger risk management and that our portfolio of community banks has superior access to the capital markets investment portfolio treasury management liquidity resources and technological advances than do smaller independent community banks 

our growth strategy is driven by four key factors 

 

  

  

  

 focus on growth markets 

the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in growth markets the states in our geographic footprint have experienced higher rates of economic growth than other states our footprint is well diversified by industry strong business formation rates real estate development and general economic 

  

expansion while some states in our footprint have experienced a significant slowing in economic activity during the recent recession others have experienced aboveaverage growth and stronger resistance to the economic downturn we believe that the company can continue to experience aboveaverage revenue growth in the long term in part because the majority of our footprint is concentrated in states that have above average gdp population and job growth and where the economies are well diversified 

 

  

  

 keep decisions that affect customers local 

we believe that over the long term ensuring that local management teams retain the authority over decisions that affect their customers is a strategy that ultimately generates superior growth in our banking businesses as supported by stronger organic loan and deposit growth relative to other banks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 maintain a sustainable competitive advantage over community banks 

to create a sustainable competitive advantage over other smaller community banks we focus on achieving superior product selection productivity economies of scale availability of liquidity and a lower cost of capital compared to community banks 

 

  

  

  

   

centralize and standardize policies and management controlling key risks 

we seek to standardize policies and practices related to the management of key risks in order to assure a consistent risk profile in an otherwise decentralized management model among these key risks and functions are credit interest rate liquidity and market risks 

 

  

  

  

 management’s overview of 2011 performance 

the company worked aggressively in three key areas during 2011 to improve profitability 

 

  

  

 the company reported net income applicable to common shareholders for 2011 of 1534 million or 083 per diluted common share compared to a net loss of 4125 million or 248 per diluted common share for 2010 

while we are encouraged with a return to profitability in 2011 we believe we have much work to do to reach an attractive return on equity and return to an acceptable growth rate for net earnings available to common shareholders

 critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies further explanations of significant accounting policies are included where applicable in the remaining notes to consolidated financial statements discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the company’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of certain of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change 

  

in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value estimates 

the company measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measures asc 820 establishes a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the related life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm securities loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc 825 financial instruments  

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets additionally we monitor the fair values of oreo and htm securities and record impairment losses as necessary an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors certain cdos are valued using an internal model and the assumptions are analyzed for sensitivity “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 provides more information regarding this analysis 

investment securities are reviewed formally on a quarterly basis for the presence of otti the evaluation process takes into account current market conditions fair value of the security and many other factors the decision to deem these securities otti is based on a specific analysis of the structure of each security and an evaluation of the underlying collateral all reviews for otti consider the particular facts and circumstances during the reporting period in review 

notes 1 5 8 10 and 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates 

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio but which have not 

  

been specifically identified the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios this process includes a quantitative analysis as well as a qualitative review of its results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgement and is described in more detail in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the allowance for loan losses 

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses which includes a quantitative and a qualitative process although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses as an example if a total of 15 billion of pass grade loans were to be immediately classified as special mention substandard or doubtful as defined in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the same proportion as the existing criticized and classified loans to the whole portfolio the quantitatively determined amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2011 would increase by approximately 68 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in the level of the criticized and classified loans may have on the allowance estimation process 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the allowance for loan losses such factors include but are not limited to national and regional economic trends and indicators we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the allowance for loan losses for the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 67 contain further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the allowance for credit losses 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we perform this annual test as of october 1 of each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired 

to determine the fair value we calculate value using a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” where applicable comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash or income flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the company is managed which might cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical bank transactions within the company’s geographic footprint comparing market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium of 33 was appropriate 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in growth trends cost structures and technology changes in discount rates changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective october 1 2011 upon completion of the evaluation process we concluded that none of our subsidiary banks was impaired and determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 23 21 and 22 respectively additionally we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 150 basis points then the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would exceed their carrying values by 14 12 and 3 respectively 

over the prior four years we have recorded impairment losses of 990 million in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation during 2009 we recorded goodwill impairment of 636 million that related primarily to amegy

accounting for derivatives 

our interest rate risk management strategy involves the use of hedging to mitigate our exposure to potential adverse effects from changes in interest rates 

the derivative contracts used by the company are exchangetraded or otc exchangetraded derivatives consist of forward currency exchange contracts which are part of the company’s services provided to commercial customers otc derivatives consist of interest rate swaps options and futures contracts 

we record all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  when quoted market prices are not available the valuation of derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative these future net cash flows however are susceptible to change due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates most significantly and foreign exchange rates as a result the estimated values of these derivatives will change over time as cash is received and paid and as market conditions change as these changes take place they may have a positive or negative impact on our estimated valuations 

we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both the company’s own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its 

  

otc derivatives based on a total expected exposure credit model in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings current threshold amounts mutual puts and guarantees additionally we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for significant changes 

notes 1 8 and 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “interest rate and market risk management” on page 79 contain further information on our use of derivatives and the methodologies used to estimate fair value 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where the company conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

the company had net dtas of 509 million at december 31 2011 compared to 540 million at december 31 2010 the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the allowance for loan losses and 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2011 related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated despite the negative evidence of a cumulative threeyear loss the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to 1 carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods 2 implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible 3 utilize the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences and 4 generate future taxable income 

the company does not have any available carryback potential to prior tax years 

tax planning strategies represent a source of positive evidence that must be considered when assessing the need for a valuation allowance tax planning strategies must be prudent and feasible and within the control of a company something that a company might not ordinarily implement but would implement to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in the realization of dtas the company has evaluated a number of tax planning strategies that if implemented could result in the realization of a majority of the net dta balance that exists at december 31 2011 these strategies mainly involve the sale of highly appreciated assets eg certain fixed assets publiclytraded securities and insurance policies management would not expect that the execution of any of the actions would involve a significant amount of expense 

the company has taxable temporary differences or dtls that will reverse and offset dtas in the periods prior to the expiration of any benefits based on our analysis and experience the general reversal pattern of dtls against dtas would be somewhat similar in character and timing because of this generally consistent reversal pattern we believe it is appropriate to reduce our gross dtas by our dtls 

the company has a strong history of positive earnings and has generated significant levels of net income in the past while the recent economic downturn has been severe the company has consistently maintained strong levels of core net interest income the company is well positioned in the highest growth areas in the country and is fundamentally strong in its capital liquidity business practices and has experienced growth in loan production and strong deposit growth the company was profitable in 2011 and most indicators of future profitability such 

  

as asset quality ratios loan portfolio balances loan production volume and deposit growth strengthened as the company improved throughout the year the company is relying on future taxable income to realize some of its dtas and expects to generate such income in 2012 and to remain profitable in future periods 

after evaluating all of the factors previously summarized and considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits the company has tax reserves at december 31 2011 of approximately 41 million net of federal andor state benefits for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted where applicable the other notes to consolidated financial statements and mda discuss new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2011 to the extent they materially affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

results of operations 

the company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2011 of 1534 million or 083 per diluted share compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of 4125 million or 248 per diluted share for 2010 the significant improvement in net earnings was mainly caused by the following favorable changes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the company reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2010 of 4125 million or 248 per diluted share compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of 12344 million or 992 per diluted share for 2009 the significant reduction in net loss was mainly caused by the following favorable changes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 during 2009 the company executed a subordinated debt modification and exchange transaction the original discount on the convertible subordinated debt was 679 million and the remaining discount at december 31 2011 was 224 million it included the following components 

 

  

 the discount associated with the convertible subordinated debt is amortized to interest expense a noncash expense using the interest method over the remaining term of the subordinated debt referred to herein as “discount amortization” when holders of the convertible subordinated notes convert to preferred stock the rate of amortization is accelerated by immediately expensing any unamortized discount associated with the converted debt referred to herein as “accelerated discount amortization” 

excluding the impact of these noncash expenses income before income taxes and subordinated debt conversions for 2011 increased to 6828 million compared to a loss of 1727 million in 2010

impact of convertible subordinated debt 

 

 the impact of the conversion of subordinated debt into preferred stock is further detailed in “capital management” on page 88 

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest incurred on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest portion of zions’ revenue for the year 2011 taxableequivalent net interest income was 17927 million compared to 17491 million in 2010 and 19208 million in 2009 for the year 2011 it was 788 of our taxableequivalent revenues practically unchanged from the 799 in 2010 in 2009 taxableequivalent net interest income was 705 of our taxableequivalent revenues a larger portion of our taxableequivalent revenue in 2009 resulted from gains including a gain on subordinated debt modification of 5089 million and gains of 1692 million on acquisitions of failed banks from the fdic the tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all years presented 

by its nature net interest income is especially vulnerable to changes in the mix and amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in the interest rates and yields associated with these assets and liabilities can significantly impact net interest income during 2011 average loans decreased faster than average deposits and most of the resulting liquidity was invested in lower yielding money market investments the company has undertaken efforts to actively reduce excess liquidity while preserving key customer relationships despite these efforts however total liquidity has continued to increase lowyielding money market investments increased to 114 of interestearning assets for 2011 compared to 87 and 49 for 2010 and 2009 respectively which adversely affected the net interest margin see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 79 for further discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and associated risk 

the increased net interest margin for 2011 compared to 2010 resulted primarily from the impact of lower discount amortization and accelerated discount amortization of convertible subordinated debt discount expense the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits declined 21 basis points to 048 in 2011 from 069 in 2010 and the average interest rate earned on net loans and leases excluding fdicsupported loans which declined 19 basis points to 540 in 2011 from 559 in 2010 the average rate earned on money market investments decreased by 1 bp from the prior year average total loans and leases for 2011 were 15 billion or 38 lower than for 2010 due to net loan payoffs paydowns and chargeoffs average interestbearing deposits decreased 17 billion from 2010 the decrease was driven primarily by time and money market deposits average borrowed funds decreased 04 billion compared to 2010 primarily due to reduced amounts of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements along with conversions of subordinated debt into preferred stock additionally the mix of lowcost deposit funding improved for 2011 average noninterestbearing deposits accounted for 352 of total average deposits as compared to 319 in 2010 

  

the decreased net interest margin for 2010 compared to 2009 resulted from the impact of the discount amortization on the modified subordinated debt including the effect of the conversion of subordinated debt into preferred stock increased nonaccrual loans and securities and higher money market investment balances earning lower rates this was offset in part by a lower cost mix of deposit funding lower rates paid on interestbearing deposits and larger incremental spreads on new loan generation average loans and leases decreased 33 billion due to loan payoffs and chargeoffs and average money market investments increased 17 billion as the company chose not to invest excess liquidity in longerduration securities average interestbearing deposits decreased 34 billion from 2009 with the decrease being driven primarily by time and money market deposits average borrowed funds decreased 16 billion compared to 2009 primarily due to reduced amounts of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements along with conversions of subordinated debt into preferred stock average noninterestbearing deposits increased 23 billion compared to 2009 and were 319 of total average deposits for 2010 compared to 258 for 2009 

a gauge that we use to measure the company’s success in managing its net interest income is the level and stability of the net interest margin the net interest margin was 381 for 2011 compared to 373 in 2010 and 394 in 2009 however the company believes that its “core net interest margin” is more reflective of its operating performance than the reported net interest margin we calculate the core net interest margin by excluding the impact of discount amortization on convertible subordinated debt accelerated discount amortization on convertible subordinated debt and additional accretion of interest income on acquired loans from the net interest margin the core net interest margin was relatively stable and high at 399 412 and 407 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively see schedule 39 on page 92 for a reconciliation between the gaap net interest margin and the nongaap core net interest margin 

chart 4 illustrates recent trends of the net interest margin core net interest margin and the average federal funds rate 

 

the spread on average interestbearing funds was 326 for 2011 compared to 312 and 352 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2011 was also affected by most of the same factors that had an impact on the net interest margin 

the net interest margin will continue to be positively impacted in future quarters by the decreased level of nonperforming assets and adversely affected by competitive loan pricing conditions rate resets on 5year reset loans made prior to the economic downturn and the discount amortization related to the debt modification transactions including the accelerated discount amortization to the extent that holders of the modified debt elect 

  

to convert their holdings to preferred stock the unamortized discount on the convertible subordinated debt was 224 million as of december 31 2011 or 410 of the total 547 million of remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes and will be amortized as interest expense over the remaining life of the debt using the interest method 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 the net interest margin was impacted by two loan repricing factors first adjustable rate loans originated in the past are resetting to lower rates as the current repricing index is lower than when those loans were originated secondly maturing loans many of which have rate floors were replaced with new loans at lower original coupons or lower floors compared to the loans originated when spreads were higher we expect that these factors may again compress the net interest margin in 2012 this margin pressure may be offset by increased loan originations the net interest margin may also be adversely affected by the competitive market pricing for high quality loans repricing of variable rate loans and the potential reduction of noninterestbearing deposits when the unlimited deposit insurance ends on december 31 2012 

the company expects to continue its efforts over the long run to maintain a slightly “assetsensitive” position with regard to interest rate risk the current period of historically low interest rates has lasted for several years during this time the company has maintained an interest rate risk position that is more asset sensitive than it was prior to the economic crisis and it expects to maintain this more asset sensitive position for a prolonged period with interest rates at historically low levels there is a reduced need to protect against falling interest rates our estimates of the company’s actual rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate risk” on page 80 

schedule 3 summarizes the average balances the amount of interest earned or incurred and the applicable yields for interestearning assets and the costs of interestbearing liabilities that generate taxableequivalent net interest income note that the “amount of interest” and the “average rate” paid on longterm debt in 2009 2010 and 2011 reflect the impacts of the discount amortization and accelerated discount amortization on the modified subordinated debt

analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate 

 

  

  in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate changes due to the volumerate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate both increase the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate when the rate increases and volume decreases the variance is allocated to rate 

  

provisions for credit losses 

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs credit trends and environmental factors see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 67 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

the provision for loan losses for 2011 was 744 million compared to 8521 million and 20169 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease in the provision during both 2011 and 2010 reflects an improvement in credit quality metrics including lower levels of criticized and classified loans lower realized loss rates in most loan segments and lower balances in construction and land development loans which declined by 350 and 370 during 2011 and 2010 respectively 

net loan and lease chargeoffs fell to 4559 million in 2011 compared to 9830 million in 2010 and 11749 million in 2009 see “nonperforming assets” on page 75 and “allowance and reserve for credit losses” on page 78 for further details 

during 2011 the company experienced improved credit quality of unfunded lending commitments and released 93 million from the related reserve while it had released 47 million in 2010 and incurred 655 million of provision expense in 2009 from period to period the expense related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizeable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations and funding as well as fluctuations in credit quality and historical loss experience 

although classified and nonperforming loan volumes continue to be elevated most measures of credit quality continued to show significant improvement in 2011 the company also experienced a decrease in special mention classified nonaccrual and past due loans as well as improvements in other credit metrics barring any significant economic downturn we expect the company’s credit costs to remain low for the next several quarters we also anticipate continued reductions in criticized and classified loans of most types and continued reduction in net chargeoffs for the next several quarters compared to the elevated levels experienced from 2008 through 2011 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues the company earns for products and services that have no interest rate or yield associated with them for 2011 noninterest income was 4818 million compared to 4405 million in 2010 and 8041 million in 2009 

  

schedule 5 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

schedule 5 

noninterest income 

 

 service charges and fees on deposit accounts decreased by 253 million or 127 from 2010 primarily due to a decline in nonsufficientfunds fees and a decrease in fees earned from business accounts service charges and fees on deposit accounts decreased by 129 million or 61 between 2009 and 2010 

other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of atm fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit card interchange fees cash management fees lending commitment fees syndication and servicing fees and other miscellaneous fees increased by 42 million from the prior year most of the increase can be attributed to higher loan fees and fees earned from other banks’ customers using the company’s atms partially offset by decreased debit card fees and remote capture licensing fees the company sold substantially all of the assets of its netdeposit subsidiary in the third quarter of 2010 and therefore did not earn any licensing fees in 2011 

on june 29 2011 the federal reserve voted to adopt regulations implementing the durbin amendment of the doddfrank act which placed limits on debit card interchange fees charged by banks the durbin amendment became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011 and resulted in an 80 million decrease in other service charges commissions and fees during that quarter the company estimates its current annualized rate of interchange bankcard fees to be approximately 30 million a reduction from the 65 million earned before the enactment of the durbin amendment the company will reevaluate the pricing of other services in order to replace some of the lost revenue that resulted from the durbin amendment 

other service charges commissions and fees were 1653 million in 2010 and 1565 million in 2009 the increase was mainly due to increased loan atm debit card and bankcard fees partially offset by decreased licensing fees and mutual fund commissions the decrease in licensing fees was primarily attributable to the sale of netdeposit’s assets 

  

capital markets and foreign exchange includes trading income public finance fees foreign exchange income and other capital market related fees in 2011 this income was 314 million compared to 376 million earned in the prior year the decrease was caused mainly by lower income from trading fixed income corporate bonds and a reduction in consulting fees related to municipal bond transactions 

in 2010 capital markets and foreign exchange income decreased to 376 million from 503 million earned in 2009 most of this decline was caused by decreases in commissions and trading income 

dividends and other investment income consist of revenue from the company’s bankowned life insurance program and revenues from other investments revenues from other investments include dividends on fhlb stock federal reserve bank stock and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates including certain alternative venture investments for 2011 this income increased by 281 from the 331 million earned during 2010 for the most part the increase was caused by higher income from several unconsolidated affiliates partially offset by decreased income from bankowned life insurance contracts 

dividends and other investment income increased by 65 million in 2010 compared to 2009 most of this gain was caused by increased income from investments in several unconsolidated affiliates and an increase in dividends on federal reserve stock partially offset by decreased income from bankowned life insurance contracts income from bankowned life insurance decreased due to the company surrendering certain life insurance contracts during 2010 

fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss consists of the following 

schedule 6 

fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss 

 

 losses from fair value and nonhedge derivatives decreased to 50 million in 2011 compared to a 158 million loss in the prior year the decreased loss is primarily the result of smaller expenses related to the trs agreement partially offset by a decrease in income from eurodollar futures 

during 2010 the company terminated fewer cash flow hedges than in 2009 nonhedge derivative income included 90 million in 2010 and 1047 million in 2009 due to the acceleration of income from oci to earnings for certain terminated cash flow hedges the amount accelerated in 2009 was due to declining loan balances which caused the reclassification to earnings of 100 of the oci balances for many of the terminated hedges there were fewer reclassifications in 2010 the company also recorded 228 million of negative fair value on the trs agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2010 for information regarding the trs agreement refer to note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during 2011 the company recorded 65 million in equity securities gains compared to losses of 60 million and 18 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the gains recognized in 2011 were principally due to 

  

the sale of bserv inc stock which the company had acquired in september 2010 when it sold the assets of its netdeposit subsidiary the loss incurred in 2010 was primarily caused by valuation losses related to venture fund investments 

the company recognized net credit related impairment losses on cdo investment securities of 337 million 854 million and 2805 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively see “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 for additional information 

valuation losses on securities purchased in 2009 consisted of 1879 million from purchases of securities from lockhart prior to fully consolidating lockhart in june 2009 and 242 million for valuation adjustments to auction rate securities which were purchased from customers during the first quarter of 2009 

in 2009 the company recorded a gain on subordinated debt modification of 5089 million the company exchanged approximately 200 million of subordinated notes for new notes with the same terms the remaining 12 billion of subordinated notes were modified to permit conversion on a par for par basis into either the company’s series a or series c preferred stock 

during 2010 the company exchanged 556 million of nonconvertible subordinated debt for 2165391 shares of common stock resulting in a 145 million gain 

acquisition related gains of 1692 million in 2009 resulted from the company’s acquisition of failed banks from the fdic with loss sharing agreements the company recognized 1465 million of gains resulting from the acquisition of vineyard bank acquired from the fdic on july 17 2009 the remaining 227 million of acquisition related gains were from the acquisitions of the failed alliance bank on february 6 2009 by cbt and great basin bank on april 17 2009 by nsb the gains resulted from the acquisition of assets that had fair values in excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed 

other noninterest income was 296 million 295 million and 121 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively most of the 2011 income is attributable to amounts received from the fdic on certain acquired loans which were determined to be covered by the loss sharing agreement in september 2010 the company sold substantially all of the assets of a whollyowned subsidiary netdeposit resulting in a 137 million pretax gain 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense decreased by 35 from 2010 this expense was 28 higher in 2010 than in 2009 during 2011 the company made significant progress in resolving problem loans and improving the credit quality of its loan portfolio which caused significantly lower other real estate expense and credit related expense the improved credit quality also resulted in a reduction of fdic premiums schedule 7 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years 

  

schedule 7 

noninterest expense 

 

 salary and bonus expense increased by 34 from the prior year most of the increase during 2011 is due to higher base salary and bonus expenses which resulted from the hiring of additional staff necessary to meet new regulatory reporting requirements and the company’s improved financial performance salary expense for 2011 included sharebased compensation expense of approximately 290 million retirement expenses and the cost of employee health and other insurance benefits also increased mostly due to higher retirement related accruals 

during 2010 salary costs increased by 25 compared to 2009 base salaries remained constant but the company’s employees earned higher bonuses and incentives the salary costs for 2010 and 2009 included sharebased compensation expense of approximately 268 million and 298 million respectively employee health and insurance benefits declined by 171 in 2010 compared to 2009 mostly due to a reduction in the accrual for incurredbutnotreported health care claims 

salaries and employee benefits are shown in greater detail in schedule 8 

schedule 8 

salaries and employee benefits 

 

 furniture and equipment expense increased in 2011 by 45 from the prior year this increase was mostly due to higher software and computer equipment maintenance costs during 2010 furniture and equipment costs grew by only 12 from 2009 

  

other real estate expense decreased by 464 in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease is primarily driven by a 489 reduction in oreo balances between these two years lower writedowns of oreo values during workout as well as larger net gains from oreo property sales oreo expenses decreased at zions bank nsb nba amegy and cbt but increased slightly at vectra 

other real estate expense increased to 1448 million in 2010 compared to 1108 million in 2009 the increase is primarily due to higher volumes of foreclosed properties added to oreo and continued declines in real estate values which resulted in increased writedowns of oreo during workout partially offset by an increase in net gains from some property sales 

credit related expense includes costs incurred during the foreclosure process prior to the company obtaining title to collateral and recording an asset in oreo as well as other outofpocket costs related to the management of problem loans and other assets these costs were 135 lower in 2011 than in 2010 mainly due to a reduction in collection and foreclosure costs credit related expenses were 712 million in 2010 compared to 450 million in 2009 this increase was a reflection of the company’s higher levels of problem loans and its efforts to resolve them 

fdic premiums for 2011 decreased by 374 compared to 2010 the decrease is mostly caused by the change in the premium assessment formulas prescribed by the fdic fdic premiums were essentially unchanged between 2009 and 2010 

other noninterest expense for 2011 increased by 37 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of a writedown of the fdic indemnification asset attributable to loans purchased from the fdic in 2009 fdicsupported loans continued to perform better than expected and therefore the indemnification asset declined in value 

in 2010 other noninterest expense was 2758 million compared to 2269 million in 2009 the increase was mostly caused by a onetime structuring fee related to the trs transaction and writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset also during 2010 the company accrued 80 million for an expected nontax deductible civil money penalty related to alleged violations of the bank secrecy act expected to be assessed by the occ and the us treasury department’s fincen bureau a penalty of this amount was announced by the occ and fincen on february 11 2011 

impairment loss on goodwill 

the company performed a goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2011 and concluded that it had not experienced any impairment loss no impairment loss was incurred in 2010 in 2009 the company recorded 6362 million of impairment losses almost entirely at amegy 

the primary causes of the impairment losses on goodwill in 2009 at the company’s banking reporting units were declines in market values of comparable companies and reduced earnings at the reporting units which resulted primarily from deterioration in credit quality of the loan portfolios see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “accounting for goodwill” on page 30 for additional information 

foreign operations 

zions bank and amegy operate foreign branches in grand cayman grand cayman islands bwi the branches only accept deposits from qualified domestic customers while deposits in these branches are not subject to frb reserve requirements there are no federal or state income tax benefits to the company or any customers as a result of these operations 

foreign deposits at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 totaled 16 billion 17 billion 17 billion respectively and averaged 15 billion for 2011 16 billion for 2010 and 20 billion for 2009 all of these foreign deposits were related to domestic customers of our subsidiary banks

the company’s income tax expense for 2011 was 1986 million compared to an income tax benefit of 1068 million and 4013 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively the company’s effective income tax rates including the effects of noncontrolling interests were 380 in 2011 267 in 2010 and 248 in 2009 the tax expense rate for 2011 was reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bankowned life insurance this rate reduction was mostly offset by the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock during the year the tax benefit rate for 2010 was reduced by the taxable surrender of certain bankowned life insurance policies and the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock the lower tax benefit rate for 2009 was mainly due to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges incurred during the year 

as discussed in previous filings the company has received federal income tax credits under the us government’s community development financial institutions fund that are recognized over a sevenyear period from the year of investment the effect of these tax credits provided an income tax benefit of 24 million in 2011 60 million in 2010 and 59 million in 2009 

the company had a net dta balance of approximately 509 million at december 31 2011 compared to 540 million at december 31 2010 the decrease in the net dta resulted primarily from items related to nonaccruing loans and oreo this decrease was offset by an increase in dtas from fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities and an increase in unfunded pension obligations the net decrease in dta was also offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to fdicsupported transactions and the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock the company did not record any additional valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2011 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 28 for more information

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases schedule 3 which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of the company’s interest earning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another of our goals is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interest earning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets such as money market investments and securities while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets the current period of slow economic growth accompanied by the low loan demand experienced in recent quarters has made it difficult to consistently achieve these goals due to higher levels of deposit funding that cannot be deployed in other than lowyielding liquid assets 

average interestearning assets were 471 billion for 2011 compared to 469 billion for 2010 average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets was 916 for 2011 compared to 908 for 2010 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and security resell agreements grew by 311 to 54 billion in 2011 compared to 41 billion in 2010 average securities increased by 98 during 2011 average total deposits decreased by 11 while average net loans and leases decreased by 38 for 2011 compared to 2010 the increases in average money market investments and average securities are a reflection of the fact that loan balances have decreased at a faster pace than the net decrease in customer deposits and other funding sources

investment securities portfolio 

we invest in securities to generate revenues for the company portions of the portfolio are also available as a source of liquidity the following schedules present a profile of the company’s investment securities portfolio with assetbacked securities classified by credit ratings the amortized cost amounts represent the company’s original cost for the investments adjusted for accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments related to the security and credit impairment losses the estimated fair value measurement levels and methodology are discussed in detail in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedules 10 and 11 present the company’s assetbacked securities classified by the highest of the ratings and the lowest of the ratings respectively from any of moody’s investors service fitch ratings or standard  poors 

in the discussion of our investment portfolio that follows we have included certain credit rating information because that information is one indication of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed and significant declines in ratings for our investment portfolio could indicate an increased level of risk for the company the doddfrank act requires that the use of rating agency ratings cannot be mandated by any federal agency for any purpose after july 21 2011 however regulations implementing this requirement have not yet been finalized and therefore the company cannot assess the impact if any this new requirement will have on the regulatory treatment of the company’s investment securities or when this might occur

investment securities portfolio 

 

 the amortized cost of investment securities on december 31 2011 decreased by 148 from the balances on december 31 2010 primarily due to the sale of investments in us treasury securities and reductions in assetbacked securities partially offset by increased investments in sba loanbacked securities 

the amortized cost of investment securities at december 31 2010 increased by 97 from the previous year this was primarily due to increased investments in shortterm us treasury securities agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities and small business administration loanbacked securities partially offset by decreased investments in auction rate securities mutual funds and other as well as municipal securities 

as of december 31 2011 50 of the 32 billion fair value of availableforsale securities portfolio was valued at level 1 616 was valued at level 2 and 334 was valued at level 3 under the gaap fair value accounting valuation hierarchy as of december 31 2010 the fair value of availableforsale securities totaled 42 billion of which 222 was valued at level 1 430 at level 2 and 348 at level 3 see note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value accounting 

the amortized cost of availableforsale investment securities valued at level 3 was 1983 million at december 31 2011 and the fair value of these securities was 1079 million the securities valued at level 3 were comprised of abs cdos and auction rate securities for these level 3 securities net pretax unrealized loss recognized in oci at the end of 2011 was 904 million as of december 31 2011 we believe that we will receive on settlement or maturity at least the amortized cost amounts of the level 3 availableforsale securities this expectation applies to both those securities for which otti has been recognized and those for which no otti has been recognized 

  

valuation sensitivity of level 3 bank and insurance cdos 

the following schedule sets forth the sensitivity of the current cdo fair values using an internal model to changes in the most significant assumptions utilized in the model 

schedule 13 

sensitivity of internal model 

 

  

        

the 2011 sensitivity analysis of valuation assumptions when compared to the same projection for 2010 identifies that actual collateral credit losses in 2011 were slightly lower than those projected however lifetime collateral loss projections increased yearoveryear because in 2011 the company increased the assumed mediumterm and longterm pds for the best performing collateral these more severe assumptions muted the effect of increased financial ratio improvement in some collateral 

the discount rates applicable to cdo tranches increased during the year especially for lower priority tranches due to an increase in distressed debt spreads over the riskfreerate the higher discount rates caused the portfolio fair value to be less sensitive than it was at the start of 2011 to the specific additional adverse assumption changes set out in the preceding schedule the weighted average discount rate increased by 300 bps during 2011 the valuation of the afs and htm portfolios including the use of trading prices is further discussed in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during the course of the year we made the following significant assumption changes as evidence developed 

significant assumption changes for 2011 

prepayment rate 

in the third quarter of 2011 the company increased the prepayment assumptions for small banks because of the extent of observed prepayments made by these types of banks the prepayment rate assumption for small banks was increased from 0 for five years and 2 thereafter to 3 per year for each year this produced 11 million of otti and the company maintained that assumption through the end of the year we changed this assumption because our cdo pools experienced significant and increasing prepayments of small bank trust preferred securities during 2011 we define “small banks” as collateral that is not subject to the phasedin disallowance of bank trust preferred securities as tier 1 capital required by the doddfrank act these are primarily banks with assets below 15 billion and to a lesser extent insurance companies in mixed bank and insurance company cdos 

since the third quarter of 2010 we have assumed that large banks with investment grade ratings will fully prepay by the end of 2015 we also assume that prepayment behaviors will be skewed toward the end of the disallowance period the doddfrank act became effective during the third quarter of 2010 and it phases in the disallowance of the inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier 1 capital for banks with assets over 15 billion “large banks” for those institutions within each pool with investment grade ratings we assume that trust preferred securities will be called prior to the end of the disallowance period 

given the 3 small bank prepayment rate assumption and the differing extent of big banks in cdo pools the pool specific prepayment rate until the end of 2015 is calculated with reference to both a the percentage of each pool’s performing collateral consisting of small banks as well as b the percentage which consists of collateral from large banks with investment grade ratings after 2015 each pool is assumed to prepay at a 3 annual rate 

for the fourth quarter of 2011 the resulting average annual prepayment rate assumption for pools which include both large and small banks is 667 for each year through 2015 followed by an annual prepayment rate assumption of 3 thereafter for pools without large banks we assume a 3 annual prepayment rate increased prepayment rates are generally favorable for the fair value of the most senior tranches and adverse to the fair value of the more junior tranches increasing the prepayment rate for small bank collateral from the assumed 3 cpr to a 4 or 5 cpr increases the fair value of the portfolio while decreasing the rate to 1 would slightly reduce the fair value 

shortterm probabilities of default 

for the third quarter of 2011 the company set a floor pd of 30 bps for years one through five for collateral where the higher of the oneyear pds from our ratio based approach and those from our third party licensed 

  

model would have been lower the company set the floor at 30 bps in order to be consistent with the shortterm pd that we would apply if we had direct lending exposures to cdo pool collateral this change had no material impact on fair value or the recording of otti 

mediumterm probabilities of default 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company changed its mediumterm pds for the best performing banks in the mediumterm given the systemic risk remaining in the banking sector previously the company had assumed a floor on pds of 30 bps for years one through five and then stepped the pd up to 65 bps in year six and beyond beginning in the fourth quarter we changed this stepup assumption to an assumed floor on pds of 48 bps for years two to five followed by a second stepup to the assumed 65 bps default rate in year six these increases in the mediumterm pds of the best performing banks created additional mediumterm collateral credit losses because financial ratio improvement in certain bank collateral only partially offset the assumption change while the changes had no material impact on fair value it did require the company to record 46 million of creditrelated otti in the fourth quarter of 2011 

longterm probabilities of default 

in the second quarter of 2011 the company raised its longterm floor pd for bank collateral for years six to maturity from 30 bps to 50 bps to be more consistent with historical bank failure rates over long periods of time this change resulted in 25 million of otti in the second quarter of 2011 in the third quarter of 2011 this assumption was increased to 65 bps and the 65 bps longterm floor pd assumption was further maintained for the fourth quarter of 2011 the company’s increase to an assumed 65 bps minimum floor pd for bank collateral starting in year 6 was more consistent with greater weighting for more recent bank failures the assumption increase was also driven by the observed pattern that banks which issued trust preferred have and may continue to fail at rates in excess of the failure rate of the general universe of banks while this change had no material impact on the fair value it did require the company to record 25 million of otti 

bank collateral deferrals 

the company’s loss and recovery experience as of december 31 2011 and our level 3 modeling assumption is essentially a 100 loss on defaults although we have to date received several generally small recoveries on defaults our experience with deferring bank collateral has been that of all collateral that has elected to defer beginning in 2007 or thereafter 49 has defaulted and approximately 42 remains within the allowable deferral period additionally thirtythree issuing banks with collateral aggregating to 9 of all deferrals and 18 of all surviving deferrals have either come current and resumed interest payments on their trust preferred securities or will do so at the next payment date older deferrals are more likely to have defaulted approximately 91 of the bank collateral which first deferred prior to january 1 2009 had defaulted by december 31 2011 for bank collateral which first deferred on or after january 1 2009 34 had defaulted by december 31 2011 new deferrals peaked in 2009 in 2008 9 of collateral performing at the start of the year elected to defer by year end this contrasts with 19 in 2009 and 10 in 2010 a total of 5099 million of bank collateral elected to defer in 2011 which comprises 46 of the collateral performing at the start of 2011 in 2010 12373 million of bank collateral elected to defer further information on the company’s valuation process is detailed in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedules 14 and 15 provide additional information on the belowinvestmentgrade rated bank and insurance trust preferred cdos’ portion of the afs and htm portfolios the schedules reflect data and assumptions that are included in the calculations of fair value and otti the schedules utilize the lowest rating to identify those securities below investment grade the schedules segment the securities by whether or not they have been determined to have otti and by original ratings level to provide granularity on the seniority level of the securities and the distribution of unrealized losses the best and worst poollevel statistic for each original 

  

ratings subgroup is presented not the best and worst single security within the original ratings grouping the number of issuers and number of currently performing issuers noted in schedule 15 are from the same security the remaining statistics may not be from the same security

certain original arated and original brated securities described in the previous schedule currently have negative subordination and are therefore undercollateralized and yet are not identified as having otti this is because our cash flow projections for these securities show negative subordination being cured prior to the securities’ maturities the collateral that backs a tranche can increase if the more senior liabilities of the cdo decrease this occurs when collateral deterioration due to defaults and deferral triggers alternative waterfall provisions for the cash flow a structural credit protection feature reroutes cash interest collections from the more junior classes of debt and income notes to pay down the principal of the most senior liabilities as the most senior liabilities are paid down while the collateral remains unchanged and if there are no additional unexpected defaults the next level of tranches become better secured the rerouting continues to divert cash away from the most junior classes of debt or income notes and gives better security to our tranche our cash flow projections predict full payment of amortized cost and interest 

schedule 16 presents the maturities of the different types of investments that the company owned and the corresponding average yield as of december 31 2011 it should be noted that most of the sba loanbacked securities and assetbacked securities are variable rate and their repricing periods are significantly less than their contractual maturities also see “liquidity risk” on page 83 and notes 1 5 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s investment securities and their management

as shown in schedule 17 the investment securities portfolio at december 31 2011 includes 607 million of nonrated fixedincome securities compared to 612 million at december 31 2010 nonrated municipal securities held in the portfolio were underwritten by zions bank’s municipal credit department in accordance with its established municipal credit standards

 otherthantemporary impairment – investments in debt securities 

we review investments in debt securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of otti taking into consideration current market conditions estimated credit impairment if any fair value in relationship to cost the extent and nature of change in fair value issuer rating changes and trends volatility of earnings current analysts’ evaluations our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of amortized cost which may be maturity and other factors for securities where an internal incomebased cash flow model or third party valuation service produces a lossadjusted expected cash flow for the security the presence of otti is identified and the amount of the credit component of otti is calculated by discounting this lossadjusted cash flow at the security’s coupon rate and comparing that value to the company’s amortized cost of the security 

under asc 320 the full extent of the difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized through earnings if fair value is below amortized cost and the investor either intends to sell the security or has found that it is more likely than not that the investor will be forced to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis asc 320 distinguishes the difference between amortized cost and fair value that is due to credit from the difference that is due to illiquidity and all other factors for holders who neither intend to sell nor judge it more likely than not that they will be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost which might be maturity only the amount of impairment representing credit loss is recognized in earnings 

we review the relevant facts and circumstances each quarter in order to assess our intentions regarding any potential sales of securities as well as the likelihood that we would be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost to date for each security whose fair value is below amortized cost we have determined that we do not intend to sell the security and that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis we then evaluate the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of each security and identify if any of the difference is due to credit the credit component of the difference is recognized in earnings and the amortized cost is written down for each security found to have otti 

for some cdo tranches for which we previously recorded otti expected future cash flows have remained stable or have slightly improved subsequent to the quarter that otti was identified and recorded for other cdo tranches an adverse change in the expected future cash flow has resulted in the recording of additional otti in both situations while a large difference may remain between fair value and amortized cost the difference is not due to credit the expected future cash flow substantiates the return of the full amortized cost as described below the primary drivers of unrealized losses in these cdos are further discussed in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we utilize a present value technique to both identify the otti present in the cdo tranches and to estimate fair value for purposes of determining the portion of the difference between fair value and amortized cost that is 

  

due to credit we follow asc 310 which includes paragraphs 1216 of the former sfas no 114 the standard specifies that a cash flow projection can be present valued at the security specific effective interest rate and the resulting present value compared to the amortized cost in order to quantify the credit component of impairment since our early adoption of the new guidance under asc 320 on january 1 2009 we have followed this methodology to identify the credit component of impairment to be recognized in earnings each quarter 

during 2011 the company recognized creditrelated net impairment losses on cdos of 337 million compared to losses of 854 million in 2010 schedule 18 identifies the breakdown of otti in 2011

otti breakdown 

 

  

  exposure to state and local governments 

the company provides multiple services to state and local governments referred to together as “municipalities” including deposit services loans investment banking services and by investing in securities issued by them 

schedule 19 summarizes the company’s exposure to state and local municipalities 

schedule 19 

municipalities 

 

 company policy requires that extensions of credit to municipalities be subjected to specific underwriting standards at december 31 2011 all of the outstanding municipal loans were performing and none were on nonaccrual a significant amount of the municipal loan and lease portfolio is secured by real estate and 

  

equipment and approximately 78 of the outstanding credits were originated by zions bank vectra and cbt see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans 

all municipal securities are reviewed quarterly for otti htm securities consist of unrated bonds issued by small local governmental entities and are purchased through private placements often in situations in which one of the company’s subsidiaries has acted as a financial advisor to the municipality prior to purchase the issuers of htm and afs municipal securities are evaluated by the company for their credit worthiness and some of the securities are guaranteed by third parties of the afs municipal securities 97 are rated by major credit rating agencies and were rated investment grade as of december 31 2011 municipal securities in the trading account are held for resale to customers the company underwrites municipal bonds which are sold to third party investors 

european exposure 

the company is monitoring global economic conditions and is aware of concerns over the creditworthiness of the governments of portugal ireland italy greece and spain the company has not granted loans to and does not own securities issued by these governments and has little or no direct exposure to companies or individuals in those countries 

in the normal course of business the company may enter into transactions with subsidiaries of companies and financial institutions headquartered in portugal ireland italy greece or spain such transactions may include deposits loans letters of credit and derivatives as well as foreign currency exchange agreements as of december 31 2011 these transactions did not present any material direct or indirect risk exposure to the company among the derivative transactions the company has entered into a trs agreement with deutsche bank ag with regard to certain bank and insurance trust preferred cdos see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements if deutsche bank were unable to perform under the trs the agreement would terminate at no cost to zions there would be no balance sheet impact from cancellation and the company would save approximately 53 million in fees quarterly however if the trs were cancelled the company would lose the potential future risk mitigation benefits of the trs and regulatory risk weighted assets under the basel i framework would increase by approximately 34 billion which would reduce regulatory riskbased capital ratios by approximately 7 

loans held for sale 

loans held for sale consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market were 202 million at december 31 2011 compared with 206 million at december 31 2010 the consumer loans are primarily fixed rate mortgages that are originated and sold to third parties 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2011 net loans and leases accounted for 699 of total assets compared to 720 at the end of 2010 schedule 20 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2011 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in certain cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 80 

  

schedule 20 

loan portfolio by type and maturity 

 

 as of december 31 2011 net loans and leases were 371 billion reflecting a 11 increase from the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in new loan originations as well as a decrease in chargeoffs of existing loans 

most of the growth in the loan portfolio during 2011 occurred in commercial and industrial commercial real estate term and 14 family residential consumer loans but was partially offset by declines in commercial real estate construction and land development and fdicsupported loans the total loan portfolio grew primarily at amegy vectra and nba while balances at zions bank and nsb declined 

  

commercial and industrial loans as well as 14 family residential consumer loans grew due to increased customer demand while the increase in commercial real estate term loans was driven in part by construction loans converting to term loans when projects are completed commercial construction and land development loans declined due to paydowns chargeoffs and the completion of construction projects additionally the demand for these types of loans has remained weak throughout 2011 the balance of fdicsupported loans declined mostly due to paydowns and payoffs and the fact that the company has not purchased additional loans with fdic loss sharing coverage since 2009 we expect construction and development loan balances to continue to decline at a moderating rate through much of 2012 and we expect fdicsupported loan balances to decline to zero over the next few years 

loans serviced for the benefit of others amounted to approximately 23 billion 27 billion and 27 billion at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

foreign loans consist primarily of commercial and industrial loans and totaled 46 million 110 million and 65 million at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively

 deposits 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company average total deposits decreased by 11 during 2011 with average interestbearing deposits decreasing by 59 and average noninterestbearing increasing by 91 the decline in deposits resulted from actions taken by the company to reduce highercost deposits including money market and time deposits the increase in average noninterestbearing deposits was largely driven by increased deposits of business customers the average interest rate paid for interestbearing deposits was 21 bps lower in 2011 than in 2010 

core deposits at december 31 2011 which exclude time deposits larger than 100000 and brokered deposits grew by 68 or 26 billion from december 31 2010 the increase was due to growth in noninterestbearing deposits as well as savings and now deposits partially offset by decreased time and money market deposits 

demand savings and money market deposits comprised 884 of total deposits at the end of 2011 compared with 858 at december 31 2010 

during 2011 and 2010 the company reduced brokered deposits due to excess liquidity and weak loan demand at december 31 2011 total deposits included 204 million of brokered deposits compared to 435 million at december 31 2010

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from unfunded lending commitments 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through a uniform credit policy credit administration and credit examination functions at the parent we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio further an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to management and to the credit review committee of the board of directors new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by the new product review committee at the bank level or parent level depending on the inherent risk of the new activity 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each affiliate bank is able to modify corporate credit policy to be more conservative however corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to create a more liberal policy historically only a limited number of such modifications have been approved this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

credit risk associated with counterparties to offbalance sheet credit instruments is generally limited to the hedging of interest rate risk through the use of swaps and futures our subsidiary banks that engage in this activity have isda agreements in place under which derivative transactions are entered into with major derivative dealers each isda agreement details the collateral arrangements between our subsidiaries and their counterparties in every case the amount of the collateral required to secure the exposed party in the derivative transaction is determined by the fair value of the derivative and the credit rating of the party with the obligation some of these counterparties are domiciled in europe however the company’s maximum exposure that is not cash collateralized to any single counterparty did not exceed 11 million at december 31 2011 

the company’s credit risk management strategy includes diversification of its loan portfolio the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty during 2009 the company adopted new concentration limits on various types of commercial real estate lending particularly construction and land development lending which have contributed to further reducing the company’s exposure to this type of lending subsequently the company has further tightened concentration limits in various types of commercial real estate lending and has adopted concentration 

  

limits related to other types of lending including leveraged lending and lending to municipalities and to the energy sector all of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers located within the geographical footprint of its banking subsidiaries 

as displayed in schedule 22 at the end of 2011 no single loan type exceeded 279 of the company’s total loan portfolio during 2011 construction and land development decreased to 61 of total loans compared to 95 at the end of 2010 

schedule 22 

loan portfolio diversification 

 

 the company’s loan portfolio includes loans that were acquired from failed banks in 2009 alliance bank great basin bank and vineyard bank these loans include nonperforming loans and other loans with characteristics indicative of a high credit risk profile substantially all of these loans are covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic for which the fdic generally will assume 80 of the first 275 million of credit losses for the alliance bank assets 40 million of credit losses for the great basin bank assets 465 million of credit losses for the vineyard bank assets and 95 of the credit losses in excess of those amounts therefore the company’s financial exposure to losses from these assets is substantially limited in addition the acquired loans have performed better than expected fdicsupported loans represented approximately 20 and 26 of the company’s total loan portfolio at the end of 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the company participates in various lending programs in which guarantees are supplied by us government agencies such as the small business administration federal housing authority veterans’ administration exportimport bank of the us and the us department of agriculture as of december 31 

  

2011 the principal balance of such loans was 603 million and the guaranteed portion amounted to 446 million most of these loans were guaranteed by the small business administration schedule 23 presents government agency guaranteed loans excluding fdicsupported loans as of december 31 2011

 the credit quality of the company’s loan portfolio continued to improve throughout 2011 nonperforming lending related assets decreased by 419 from december 31 2010 gross chargeoffs declined to 560 million compared to 1074 million in 2010 net chargeoffs decreased to 456 million in 2011 from 983 million in 2010

commercial real estate portfolio by loan type and collateral location 

at december 31 2011 

 

  

    

approximately 34 of the commercial real estate term loans consist of miniperm loans as of december 31 2011 for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of three to seven years the remaining 66 of commercial real estate loans are term loans with initial maturities of generally 15 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and includes for example criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project and occupancy rates 

approximately 35 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at december 31 2011 consisted of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development properties are tied to specific retail apartment office or other projects underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected economics of the project are primary in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily projects we look for substantial preleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 

although lending for residential construction and development involves a different product type many of the requirements previously mentioned such as credit worthiness of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity remargining requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan heavy consideration is given to market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made 

real estate appraisals are ordered and validated independently of the credit officer and the borrower generally by each bank’s appraisal review function which is staffed by certified appraisers appraisals are ordered from outside appraisers at the inception renewal or for cre loans upon the occurrence of any event causing a downgrade to a “criticized” or “classified” designation the frequency for obtaining updated appraisals for these adversely graded credits is increased when declining market conditions exist advance rates on an “as completed basis” will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but corporate guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and spec homes and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of these schedules is closely monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally loanbyloan reviews of pass grade loans for all commercial and residential construction and land development loans are performed quarterly at zions bank nba and vectra amegy nsb and cbt perform such reviews semiannually 

interest reserves are generally established as an expense item in the budget for real estate construction or development loans we generally require borrowers to put their equity into the project at the inception of the construction this enables the bank to ensure the availability of equity in the project the company’s practice is to monitor the construction sales andor leasing progress to determine whether or not the project remains viable if at any time during the life of the credit the project is determined to not be viable the bank then takes appropriate action to protect its collateral position via negotiation andor legal action as deemed necessary the bank then evaluates the appropriate use of interest reserves at december 31 2011 and 2010 zions’ affiliates had 356 and 341 loans with an outstanding balance of 413 million and 423 million for which available interest reserves amounted to 36 million and 42 million respectively in instances where projects have been determined to not be viable the interest reserves and other appropriate disbursements have been frozen 

  

we have not been involved to any meaningful extent with insurance arrangements credit derivatives or any other default agreements as a mitigation strategy for commercial real estate loans however we do make use of personal or other guarantees as risk mitigation strategies 

commercial real estate loans are sometimes modified to increase the likelihood of collecting the maximum possible amount of the company’s investment in the loan in general the existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing a loan for impairment if the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment and our impairment methodology takes into consideration this repayment source 

additionally when we modify or extend a loan we give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty and whether a concession has been granted in determining if an interest rate concession has been granted we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates including a premium for risk for new debt with similar risk characteristics if the rate in the modification is less than current market rates it may indicate that a concession was granted however if additional collateral is obtained or if a strong guarantor exists who is believed to be able and willing to support the loan on an extended basis we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan the quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting the size of the transaction and the strength of the guarantor 

complete underwriting of the guarantor includes but is not limited to an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements leverage liquidity global cash flow global debt service coverage contingent liabilities etc the assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations additional analysis may include personal financial statements tax returns liquidity brokerage confirmations and other reports as appropriate all personal financial statements of customers entering into new relationships with the applicable bank must not be more than 60 days old on the date the transaction is approved personal financial statements that are required for existing customers must be no more than 13 months old evaluations of the financial strength of the guarantor are performed at least annually 

a qualitative assessment is performed on a casebycase basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience performance track record reputation performance of other related projects with which we are familiar and willingness to work with us and consideration of market information sources rating and scoring services this qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higherquality internal loan grade which may reduce the level of allowance the company estimates previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if at any point in time there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan 

in the event of default we pursue any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment which may come from multiple sources including the guarantee a number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor including but not limited to the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment collateral the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor possible statutory limitations eg single action rule on real estate and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared to the ultimate amount we may be able to recover in other instances the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit 

consumer loans 

the company has mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality its practice historically has been to sell “conforming” fixed rate loans to third parties including fannie mae and freddie mac for which it makes representations and warranties as to meeting certain 

  

underwriting and collateral documentation standards it has also been the company’s practice historically to hold variable rate loans in its portfolio the company does not estimate that it has any material financial risk as a result of its foreclosure practices or loan “putbacks” by fannie mae or freddie mac and has not established any reserves related to these items 

the company has a portfolio of 352 million of stated income mortgage loans with generally high fico scores at origination including “onetime close” loans to finance the construction of homes which convert into permanent jumbo mortgages as of december 31 2011 approximately 32 million of these loans had fico scores of less than 620 these totals exclude heldforsale loans stated income loans account for approximately 11 million or 40 of our credit losses in 14 family residential first mortgage loans during 2011 and were primarily in utah and arizona 

the company is engaged in home equity credit line lending at december 31 2011 the company’s hecl portfolio totaled 22 billion including fdicsupported loans approximately 10 billion of the portfolio is secured by first deeds of trust while the remaining 12 billion is secured by junior liens the outstanding balances and commitments by origination year for the junior lien hecls are presented in schedule 27 

schedule 27 

jr lien hecls – outstanding balances and total commitments 

 

 more than 99 of the company’s hecl portfolio is still in the draw period and approximately 54 is scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years of the total home equity credit line portfolio 052 was 90 or more days past due at december 31 2011 as compared to 041 as of december 31 2010 during 2011 the company modified 02 million of home equity credit lines the annualized credit losses for the hecl portfolio were 105 and 129 basis points for 2011 and 2010 respectively 

as of december 31 2011 loans representing approximately 17 of the outstanding balance in the hecl portfolio were estimated to have combined loantovalue cltv ratios above 100 estimated cltv ratios are based on projecting values forward from the most recent valuation of the underlying collateral using home price indices at the metropolitan area level generally a valuation of collateral is performed at origination for junior lien hecls the estimated current balance of prior liens is added to the numerator in the calculation of cltv the additional breakouts for the cltv as of december 31 2011 are shown in schedule 28

hecl portfolio by combined loantovalue 

 

 underwriting standards for the hecl portfolio generally include a maximum 80 cltv with high credit scores at origination credit bureau data credit scores and estimated cltv are refreshed on a quarterly basis 

  

and are used to monitor and manage accounts including amounts available under the lines of credit the allowance for loan losses is determined through the use of roll rate models and first lien hecls are modeled separate from junior lien hecls refer to note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the allowance 

nonperforming assets 

total nonperforming lending related assets were 1063 million at december 31 2011 compared to 1828 million at december 31 2010 and 2769 million at december 31 2009 

the company’s nonperforming lendingrelated assets as a percentage of net loans and leases and oreo decreased significantly during 2011 to 283 at december 31 2011 compared to 491 and 679 at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

total nonaccrual loans excluding fdicsupported loans at december 31 2011 decreased by 607 million from december 31 2010 and included decreases of 274 million in construction and land development loans 108 million in commercial real estate term loans and 103 million in commercial owner occupied loans the largest decreases in nonaccrual loans occurred primarily at zions bank amegy and nsb 

the balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns writeoffs and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions if a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual company policy does not allow the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to commercial real estate term loans refer to note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

schedule 29 sets forth the company’s nonperforming lendingrelated assets

restructured loans 

tdrs are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties and for which the company has granted a concession that it would not otherwise consider commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such tdrs may include firstlien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 

for certain tdrs we split the loan into two new notes – a note and b note the a note is structured to comply with our current lending standards at current market rates and is tailored to suit the customer’s ability to make timely interest and principal payments the b note includes the granting of the concession to the borrower and varies by situation we may defer principal and interest payments until the a note has been paid in full at the time of restructuring the a note is identified and classified as a tdr the b note is chargedoff but the obligation is not forgiven to the borrower and any payments collected are accounted for as recoveries the outstanding balance of loans restructured using the ab note strategy was approximately 256 million at december 31 2011 

if the loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that the company is reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest the loan may be returned to accrual status the borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account in determining whether or not a loan should be returned to accrual status 

in the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured a loan may no longer be reported as a tdr if it is on accrual is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure during 2011 tdrs that were removed from tdr status amounted to approximately 174 million company policy requires that the removal of tdr status be approved at the same management level that approves the upgrading of a loan’s classification see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 other nonperforming assets 

in addition to the lendingrelated nonperforming assets the company had 124 million in carrying value of investments in debt securities that were on nonaccrual status at december 31 2011 compared to 195 million at december 31 2010 

  

allowance and reserve for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

schedule 31 shows the changes in the allowance for loan losses and a summary of loan loss experience 

schedule 31 

summary of loan loss experience 

 

   

schedule 32 provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation among the portfolio segments 

schedule 32 

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 

 

 the total allowance for loan losses at december 31 2011 decreased by 390 million from the level at yearend 2010 the decreases in the alll for commercial lending cre consumer and fdicsupported loans largely reflect improvements in credit quality and declines in loss rates in each of these segments although credit quality continues to improve the company increased the portion of the alll related to qualitative and environmental factors to keep changes in the level of the alll consistent with changes in these factors the decrease in the alll for commercial real estate loans also reflects the decrease in loans outstanding for the construction and land development portfolio 

for 2010 the 148 million increase in the allowance for loan losses for commercial lending reflects deterioration of borrower credit quality due to difficult economic conditions reductions in collateral values and increases in realized loss rates that increased our quantitative loss factors for commercial real estate and consumer portfolios as well the 266 million decrease in the allowance for commercial real estate loans in 2010 largely reflects the decrease in loans outstanding for the construction and land development portfolio and improving credit quality measures across the company 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is separately shown in the company’s consolidated balance sheet and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are included in noninterest expense in the statement of income the reserve balance decreased by 9 million from december 31 2010 and is primarily due to improvements in the credit quality of lending commitments see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses 

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company including interest rate and market risk management the 

  

boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews limit exceptions reported by management the board has established the management alco to which it has delegated the functional management of interest rate and market risk for the company alco’s primary responsibilities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have the net interest margin increase slightly in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being slightly “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise the company’s balance sheet is more asset sensitive on december 31 2011 than it was at the end of the previous year due to the low level of rates and the natural lower bound of zero for market indices there is minimal sensitivity to falling rates at the current time decreasing market index rates by 200bp with a lower bound of 0 decreases interest income by 2 in the income simulation however if the federal reserve continues to implement its announced intent to keep interest rates at historically low levels though 2014 given the company’s asset sensitivity it expects its net interest margin to be under modest pressure 

we attempt to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income primarily through the use of interest rate floors on variable rate loans interest rate swaps interest rate futures and by avoiding large exposures to longterm fixed rate interestearning assets that have significant negative convexity our earning assets are largely tied to the shorter end of the interest rate curve the prime lending rate and the libor curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods duration of equity and income simulation in the duration of equity method we measure the expected changes in the fair values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the income simulation method we analyze the expected changes in income in response to changes in interest rates 

  

duration of equity is derived by first calculating the dollar duration of all assets liabilities and derivative instruments dollar duration is determined by calculating the fair value of each instrument assuming interest rates sustain immediate and parallel movements up 1 and down 1 the average of these two changes in fair value is the dollar duration subtracting the dollar duration of liabilities from the dollar duration of assets and adding the net dollar duration of derivative instruments results in the dollar duration of equity duration of equity is computed by dividing the dollar duration of equity by the fair value of equity a positive value implies that an increase in interest rates decreases the dollar value of equity whereas a negative value implies that an increase in interest rates increases the dollar value of equity the company’s policy is generally to maintain a duration of equity between 3 to 7 however exceptions to the policy are approved by the company’s board of directors in the current low interest rate environment the company is operating with a duration of equity of slightly less than 3 in some planning scenarios 

income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income and total rate sensitive income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income and total rate sensitive income are measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio for income simulation company policy requires that interest sensitive income from a static balance sheet be limited to a decline of no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 basis points 

both of these measurement methods require that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of duration and income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is actively managed to maintain a slightly assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

the estimated duration of equity and the income simulation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these estimates we view both the duration of equity and the income simulation results as falling within a wide range of possibilities 

as of the dates indicated schedule 33 shows the company’s estimated duration of equity and percentage change in interest sensitive income based on a static balance sheet in the first year after the rate change if interest rates were to sustain an immediate parallel change of 200 basis points the company estimates interest rate risk with two sets of deposit repricing scenarios the first scenario assumes that administeredrate deposits money market interestearning checking and savings reprice at a faster speed in response to changes in interest rates the second scenario assumes that those deposits reprice at a slower speed 

  

schedule 33 

duration of equity and interest sensitive income 

 

  

  termination of long positions in eurodollar futures during 2011 and a reduction of outstanding receivefixedrate interest rate swaps due to maturities also contributed to the decrease in the duration of equity the changes in the income simulation sensitivity can be attributed to the same factors see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the interest rate derivatives portfolio 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at the end of 2011 and 2010 approximately 76 and 77 respectively of the company’s commercial lending and commercial real estate portfolios were variable rate and primarily tied to either the prime rate or libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have variable interest rates 

we have traditionally engaged in an ongoing program of swapping primebased and liborbased loans for “receivefixed” contracts however during 2010 we terminated and did not replace a number of such swaps both due to the difficulty in finding stable pools of floating rate loans with identical repricing characteristics and with the objective of positioning the company’s balance sheet to be more asset sensitive at the end of 2011 and 2010 the company held approximately 335 million and 520 million notional amount respectively of such cash flow hedge contracts these swaps also expose the company to counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk the company’s approach to managing this risk is discussed in “credit risk management” on page 67 the company retains basis risk due to changes between the prime rate and libor on nonhedge derivative basis swaps see “accounting for derivatives” on page 31 for further details about our derivative instruments also due largely to competitive pressures the company’s subsidiary banks decreased the use of interest rate floors on new loans as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 approximately 458 and 484 of all of the company’s variable rate loan balances contain floors of the loans with floors approximately 779 of the december 31 2011 and 755 of the december 31 2010 balances were priced at the floor rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 122 and 122 respectively 

during 2011 the long eurodollar futures positions which were used to extend the duration of cash deposits were terminated although this led to an increase in asset sensitivity the flattening of the yield curve resulted in minimal upside to holding long eurodollar futures positions 

at december 31 2011 the company held 335 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements of which 185 million and 150 million will mature in 2012 and 2013 respectively for additional information regarding derivative instruments refer to notes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

market risk – fixed income 

the company engages in the underwriting and trading of us agency municipal and corporate securities this trading activity exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2011 the company had 40 million of trading assets and 44 million of securities sold not yet purchased compared to 49 million and 43 million respectively at the end of the prior year 

the company is exposed to market risk through changes in fair value the company is also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in the fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in oci for each financial reporting period during 2011 the aftertax decrease in oci attributable to afs and htm securities was 93 million compared to an increase of 4 million in 2010 the decrease attributable to interest rate swaps for 2011 and 2010 was 21 million and 37 million respectively if any of the afs or htm securities become other than temporarily impaired the credit impairment is charged to operations see “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 for additional information on otti

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded in addition the company owns equity securities in companies that are not publicly traded that are accounted for under cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs in either case the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since the fair value of these securities may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss these equity investments are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

the company holds investments in prepublic companies through various venture capital funds the company’s equity exposure to these investments at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 was approximately 49 million and 48 million respectively 

additionally amegy has in place an alternative investments program these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds generally are not part of the strategy since the underlying companies are typically not creditworthy the carrying value of the investments was 71 million at december 31 2011 and 68 million at december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 and 2010 the company had a total remaining funding commitment of 44 million and 56 million respectively to sbic nonsbic funds and private equity investments of these commitments approximately 29 million and 41 million respectively were at amegy 

under provisions of the doddfrank act the company is allowed to fund remaining unfunded portions of existing private equity fund commitments such as those described above but is not allowed to make any new commitments to invest in private equity funds except for sbic funds 

liquidity risk 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the 

  

monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary bank levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines for example the ‘time to required funding’ and fixed charges coverage ratios that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and bank subsidiaries as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the parent and bank liquidity 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally by zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the policy guidelines these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and potentially to the company’s board of directors the subsidiary banks have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and the federal reserve and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank andor correspondent banks the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer but are not involved in any other funding decisionmaking processes 

contractual obligations 

schedule 34 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2011 

schedule 34 

contractual obligations 

 

  

     

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in schedule 34 the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of its business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive cash or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change for further information on derivative contracts see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity management actions 

consolidated cash and interestbearing deposits at the parent and its subsidiaries increased to 82 billion at december 31 2011 from 55 billion at december 31 2010 during 2011 we had a significant increase in cash mainly due to an increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits and a decrease in investment securities partially offset by a net funding of new loan originations 

parent company liquidity the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders including the cpp preferred equity issued to the us department of the treasury the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes equity contributed through the exercise of stock options and longterm debt and equity issuances 

during 2011 the parent received common dividends totaling 526 million and preferred dividends totaling 188 million from two of its bank subsidiaries also the parent received cash of 100 million from another bank subsidiary as a result of the redemption of preferred stock issued to the parent during 2010 the parent did not receive dividends on common or preferred stock from its banking subsidiaries the dividends that our bank subsidiaries can pay to the parent are restricted by current and historical earning levels retained earnings and riskbased and other regulatory capital requirements during 2011 all of the company’ subsidiary banks except vectra recorded a profit excluding intercompany securities sales vectra also recorded a profit we expect that this profitability will be sustained and may permit additional payments of dividends by the banks to the parent andor returns of capital to the parent in 2012 

earnings on the parent’s investment securities portfolio have been reduced therefore cash receipts from subsidiaries and investments currently do not cover the parent’s interest and dividend payments in 2011 the parent did not increase its investment in its banking subsidiaries due to their improved earnings credit metrics and capital levels the company has held the dividend on its common stock to 001 per share per quarter in order to conserve both capital and cash at the parent see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of dividend capacities and limitations 

general financial market and economic conditions have adversely impacted the company’s access to and cost of external financing however these adverse impacts further moderated in 2011 access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is directly affected by the credit ratings they receive from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings in december 2011 dbrs changed its outlook for the company to stable from negative and moody’s changed its ratings for the company’s longterm debt to ba3 from b2 and subordinated debt to b1 from b3 and changed its outlook for the company to stable from positive while moody’s rates the 

  

company’s senior debt as ba3 or noninvestment grade standard  poor’s fitch and dbrs all rate the company’s senior debt at a low investment grade level in addition all four rating agencies rate the company’s subordinated debt as noninvestment grade 

schedule 35 presents the parent’s ratings as of december 31 2011 

schedule 35 

credit ratings 

 

 during 2011 the primary sources of additional cash to the parent in the capital markets were 1 169 million from the issuance of one to fiveyear unsecured senior notes and 2 25 million from the issuance of new shares of common stock the parent had a cash balance of 956 million at december 31 2011 compared to a cash balance of 550 million at december 31 2010 the parent had 700 million of us treasury securities at december 31 2010 which were sold during 2011 

during 2011 and 2010 the parent’s operating expenses included cash payments for interest of approximately 127 million and 147 million respectively additionally the parent paid approximately 156 million and 109 million of dividends on preferred stock and common stock respectively for the same applicable periods note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2011 and 2010 

repayments of shortterm borrowings by the parent exceeded new issuances which resulted in net cash outflows of 166 million during 2011 

at december 31 2011 maturities of the company’s longterm senior and subordinated debt ranged from june 2012 to november 2016 with interest rates from 078 to 775 

see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of the company’s longterm debt 

subsidiary bank liquidity the subsidiaries’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2011 these core deposits excluding brokered deposits in aggregate constituted 954 of consolidated deposits compared with 935 of consolidated deposits at december 31 2010 on a consolidated basis the company’s gross loan to total deposit ratio is at a historical low of 869 another measure of strong bank liquidity 

historically the company’s subsidiary banks have also obtained brokered deposits to serve as an additional source of liquidity which is currently not needed given the strong levels of affiliate liquidity the company has aggressively lowered its brokered deposit usage during 2011 total brokered deposits declined 231 million to 204 million at yearend down from 435 million at december 31 2010 brokered deposits are currently 05 of total deposits 

  

total deposits increased by 1941 million during 2011 mainly due to an increase of 2457 million in noninterestbearing demand deposits savings and now deposits also increased during 2011 but were offset by a larger combined decrease in money market and time deposits due to efforts to reduce excess liquidity money market investments also increased during 2011 mainly due to the deposit increase and resulted in a net decrease in cash of 2417 million 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank act made permanent the maximum deposit insurance amount of 250000 on november 9 2010 the fdic issued a final rule providing temporary unlimited insurance coverage for noninterestbearing transaction accounts at all fdicinsured depository institutions effective december 31 2010 through december 31 2012 the company and the banking industry may experience a reduction in noninterestbearing deposits beginning in late 2012 or in 2013 as a result of a decrease in demand for these deposits after the expiration of the temporary unlimited insurance coverage 

the fhlb system has from time to time been a significant source of funding and backup liquidity for each of the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank and tcbw are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nba are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy bank is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity requirements the subsidiary banks are required to invest in fhlb stock to maintain their borrowing capacity at december 31 2011 the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 133 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 the company had de minimus amounts of longterm borrowings outstanding with the fhlb – approximately 24 million and 20 million respectively at december 31 2011 and 2010 the subsidiary banks’ total investment in fhlb stock was approximately 116 million and 125 million respectively 

the company’s investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture that is taken for 2011 investment securities’ activities resulted in a decrease in investment securities holdings and a net increase of cash in the amount of 816 million 

maturing balances in our subsidiary banks’ loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows lending activity for 2011 resulted in a net cash outflow of 1214 million compared to a net cash inflow of 1754 million for 2010 

during 2011 the company paid income taxes of 4 million while it received net cash income tax refunds of 325 million during 2010 the majority of the income tax refunds were for the benefit of our subsidiary banks and the remainder for the benefit of the parent 

operational risk management 

operational risk is the potential for unexpected losses attributable to human error systems failures fraud or inadequate internal controls and procedures in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has a corporate risk management department whose responsibility is to help management identify and assess key risks and monitor the key internal controls and processes that the company has in place to mitigate operational risk we have documented controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

to manage and minimize its operating risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments in addition reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we maintain contingency plans and systems for operations support in the event of natural or other disasters efforts are continually underway to improve the company’s oversight of operational risk 

  

including enhancement of riskcontrol self assessment and antifraud measures reporting to the enterprise risk management committee and the board we also mitigate operational risk through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

capital management 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the cmc whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary banks other major cmc responsibilities include 

 

  

  

 the cmc in managing the capital of the company may set capital standards that are higher than those approved by the board but may not set lower limits 

the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the cmc oversees the company’s capital “stress testing” under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios the company has established processes to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the company under hypothetical economic scenarios these stress tests facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity including quantitative limits reflecting the board of directors’ risk appetite these processes are also used to conduct the stress testing required by the federal reserve in the 2012 capital plan review that was submitted to the federal reserve on january 9 2012 the company considers the filing and subsequent federal reserve review to be a part of an ongoing regulatory process the regulators have indicated that these stress test results will also be an important factor in determining all capital and debt actions including the repurchase of outstanding securities and the timing of new issuances and whether an institution can pay or increase dividends and ultimately repay amounts received under the tarp capital purchase program 

additionally the federal reserve has proposed regulation requiring future results of these stress tests to be disclosed which may influence bank regulatory supervisory requirements concerning the company and impact the amount or timing of dividends or distributions to the company’s shareholders on an annual basis 

  

total controlling interest shareholders’ equity at december 31 2011 was 6985 million compared to 6648 million at december 31 2010 an increase of 51 the increase in total controlling interest shareholders’ equity from december 31 2010 is primarily due to 3238 million of net income applicable to controlling interest 256 million of subordinated debt converting into preferred stock and 25 million from the issuance of common stock partially offset by 93 million of unrealized losses on investment securities recorded in other comprehensive income and 1561 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock the net increase in unrealized losses on securities and derivatives recognized in other comprehensive income during 2011 resulted from the effects of higher levels of volatility and increased credit spreads in fixed income securities markets due in part to the uncertainty of the resolution of the european debt situation the increase in unrealized losses on cdo securities is consistent with general buyer withdrawal from risk assets in the second half of the year 

note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information on riskbased capital in addition “liquidity risk” on page 83 and notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discuss the company’s debt and equity transactions during 2011 

conversions of convertible subordinated debt into preferred stock have augmented the company’s capital position and reduced future refinancing needs from the original modification in june 2009 through december 2011 663 million of debt has been extinguished and 773 million of preferred capital has been added schedule 36 shows the effect the conversions had on tier 1 capital and outstanding convertible subordinated debt 

schedule 36 

impact of convertible subordinated debt 

 

 the company’s net income applicable to controlling interest of 3238 million during 2011 more than offset the 137 million decrease in common equity resulting from subordinated debt conversions during 2010 the company’s various issuances of new common stock and warrants to purchase common stock totaling 838 million more than offset the 205 million decrease in common equity resulting from subordinated debt conversions 

on february 16 2012 the company filed a form 8k disclosing that as of february 15 2012 holders of subordinated notes elected to convert a combined 298 million principal amount of these notes into the company’s preferred stock the company expects an additional 29404 shares of series c and 370 shares of 

  

series a preferred stock will be issued on march 15 2012 unless the elections are revoked prior to that date also 51 million of the original beneficial conversion feature will be reclassified into preferred stock from common stock as a result of this conversion the expected pretax accelerated discount amortization attributable to the conversions will be approximately 122 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 58 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 

the company paid 74 million in dividends on common stock during 2011 the dividends paid per share of 001 each quarter in 2011 were unchanged from the rate paid since the third quarter of 2009 under the terms of the cpp the company may not increase the dividend on its common stock above 032 per share per quarter during the period the senior preferred shares are outstanding without adversely impacting the company’s interest in the program or without permission from the us department of the treasury the company does not expect to increase its common dividend until sometime after all of its tarp cpp preferred stock has been repaid 

the company recorded preferred stock dividends of 1704 million and 1229 million during 2011 and 2010 respectively preferred dividends for 2011 and 2010 include 916 million and 902 million respectively related to the tarp preferred stock issued to the us department of the treasury consisting of cash payments of 700 million in both 2011 and 2010 and accretion of 216 million and 202 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively for the difference between the fair value and par amount of the tarp preferred stock when issued 

banking organizations are required under published regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios the company’s capital ratios are shown in schedule 37 

schedule 37 

capital ratios 

 

 the company expects that it and the banking industry as a whole will be required by market forces andor regulation including new standards “basel iii” promulgated in december 2010 and revised in june 2011 by the basel committee on banking supervision to operate with higher capital ratios than in the past therefore during 2011 we continued our efforts to preserve and augment capital in response to these anticipated regulatory changes and in preparation for the eventual repayment of tarp cpp preferred stock rather than return more capital to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases 

at december 31 2011 regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital were 6946 million and 7780 million respectively compared to 6350 million and 7364 million at december 31 2010 

gaap to nongaap reconciliation 

1 tier 1 common equity 

traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulators have assessed a bank’s capital adequacy based on tier 1 capital the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations regulators have 

  

begun supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier 1 capital known as tier 1 common equity the tier 1 common equity ratio is the core capital component of the basel iii standards and we believe that it increasingly is becoming a key ratio considered by regulators investors and analysts there is a difference between this ratio calculated using basel i definitions of tier 1 common equity capital and those definitions using basel iii rules when fully phased in which have not yet been formalized in regulation the tier 1 common riskbased capital ratios in the capital ratios schedule presented previously use the current basel i definitions for determining the numerator because tier 1 common equity is not formally defined by gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure and other entities may calculate them differently than the company’s disclosed calculations since banking regulators investors and analysts may assess the company’s capital adequacy using tier 1 common equity we believe that it is useful to provide them the ability to assess the company’s capital adequacy on this same basis 

tier 1 common equity is often expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets under the current riskbased capital framework a bank’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of offbalance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad “basel i” risk categories for banks like our banking subsidiaries that have not adopted the basel ii “advanced measurement approach” the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the riskweighted assets total that as adjusted comprises the denominator of certain riskbased capital ratios tier 1 capital is then divided by this denominator riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 capital ratio adjustments are made to tier 1 capital to arrive at tier 1 common equity tier 1 common equity is also divided by the riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 common equity ratio the amounts disclosed as riskweighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements

tangible common equity nongaap 

 

 for items 2 3 and 4 the identified adjustments to reconcile from the applicable gaap financial measures to the nongaap financial measures are included where applicable in financial results or in the balance sheet presented in accordance with gaap we consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and financial position 

we believe that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the nongaap financial measures provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which will assist regulators investors and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the company and in predicting future performance these nongaap financial measures are used by management and the board of directors to assess the performance of the company’s business or its financial position for evaluating bank reporting segment performance for presentations of company performance to investors and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts we further believe that presenting these nongaap financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management and the board of directors 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

competition 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks thrifts and credit unions including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies and a variety of other types of companies many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include pricing convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered and the level of service delivered the company must compete effectively along all of these parameters to remain successful 

  

supervision and regulation 

the banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated such regulation is intended among other things to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers including depositors these regulations are not however generally charged with protecting the interests of our shareholders or creditors described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the company the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulations and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the company 

the parent is a bank holding company and a financial holding company as provided by the glb the bhc act and other federal statutes as modified by the glb act and the doddfrank act provide the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the federal reserve board the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a bank holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company the parent and its subsidiary banks must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required

the doddfrank act 

the events of the past few years have led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” or “doddfrank” which was enacted in july 2010 is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the united states among other major things it creates a new systemic risk oversight body the fsoc the fsoc will oversee and coordinate the efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies including the frb the sec the commodity futures trading commission and the fdic in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns the doddfrank act directs the fsoc to make recommendations to the frb as to supervisory requirements and heightened prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies such as zions including capital leverage liquidity and riskmanagement requirements 

in addition the doddfrank act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating a resolution authority mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements and requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and through numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector among other things affecting capital standards the doddfrank act provides that 

 

  

  

 these provisions will require us to maintain greater levels of capital and will limit the forms of capital that we will be able to rely upon for regulatory purposes for example provisions of the doddfrank act require us 

  

to deduct over three years beginning july 21 2011 all trust preferred securities from our tier 1 capital some of the act’s provisions affecting the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and pricing of our products and services include 

 

  

  

 the doddfrank act also creates a new cfpb which will be responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining financial institutions for compliance with and enforcing those regulations the doddfrank act will subject national banks to further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws which currently enables national banks and their subsidiaries to comply with federal regulatory requirements without complying with various state laws in addition the act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law 

as discussed further throughout this section many aspects of doddfrank are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company or across the industry 

capital standards – basel framework 

the frb has established capital guidelines for financial holding companies the occ the fdic and the frb have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks these bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply 

in 2004 the bcbs proposed a new capital accord “basel ii” to replace basel i basel ii provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk – an advanced internal ratingsbased approach tailored to individual institutions’ circumstances and a standardized approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in existing guidelines basel ii also sets capital requirements for operational risk and refines the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures 

in december 2007 us banking regulators published the final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approaches of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” the parent is not required to comply with the basel ii in july 2008 the agencies issued a proposed rule that would give banking organizations that do not use the advanced approaches the option to implement a new riskbased capital framework which would adopt the standardized approach of basel ii for credit risk the basic indicator approach of basel ii for operational risk and related disclosure requirements a definitive rule has not been issued 

in december 2010 the bcbs released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation now officially identified by the bcbs as “basel iii” basel iii when implemented by the 

  

us banking agencies and fully phasedin will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common equity the basel iii final capital framework among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer when the latter is applied will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the short fall 

the implementation of the basel iii final framework is expected to commence january 1 2013 on that date banking institutions will be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios 

 

  

  

 the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 will begin on january 1 2014 and will be phasedin over a fiveyear period 20 per year the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january 1 2016 at 0625 and will be phased in over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

  

the us banking agencies have indicated informally that they expect to propose regulations implementing basel iii in mid2011 with final adoption of implementing regulations in mid2012 given that the basel iii rules are subject to change and the scope and content of capital regulations that the us banking agencies may adopt under doddfrank is uncertain we cannot be certain of the impact new capital regulations will have on our capital ratios 

historically regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter both in the us and internationally without required formulaic measures the basel iii framework proposes that banks and bank holding companies measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes going forward will be required by regulation one proposed test referred to as the lcr would be designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon or if greater 25 of its expected total cash outflow under an acute liquidity stress scenario the other measure referred to as the nsfr would be designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon these requirements will incent banking entities to increase their holdings of us treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of longterm debt as a funding source the lcr would be implemented subject to an observation period beginning in 2011 but would not be introduced as a requirement until january 1 2015 and the nsfr would not be introduced as a requirement until january 1 2018 these new standards are subject to further rulemaking and their terms may well change before implementation 

other regulation 

the company is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which addresses among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a comprehensive system of corporate governance practices this system includes corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct and charters for the audit credit review compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit the tools available to the frb which may be used to implement monetary policy include 

 

  

  

  

  

 these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the company including but not limited to 

the company has been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

the united states and many other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected and are likely to continue for some time to adversely affect the company’s assets including its loans and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition in response to the economic crisis the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis these programs and policies appear to have stabilized the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of 2008 but the extent to which these programs and policies will assist in an economic recovery or may lead to adverse consequences whether anticipated or unanticipated is still unclear if these programs and policies are ineffective in bringing about an economic recovery or result in substantial adverse developments the economic conditions may again become more severe or adverse economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions including a double dip recession or delay in the recovery would adversely affect the company 

the limitations on incentive compensation contained in the arra the implementing of its regulations and other bank regulations may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees 

because we have not yet repurchased the us treasury’s cpp investment we remain subject to the restrictions on incentive compensation contained in the arra on june 10 2009 the us treasury released its interim final rules implementing the provisions of the arra and limiting the compensation practices at institutions in which the us treasury is invested the us treasury has since revised such rules and released written guidance interpreting and expanding on arra and the interim final rules financial institutions which have repurchased the us treasury’s cpp investment are relieved of the restrictions imposed by the arra and its implementing regulations and related guidance due to these restrictions we may not be able to successfully compete with financial institutions that have repurchased the us treasury’s investment to attract retain and appropriately incentivize high performing employees in addition bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees these regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel if we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

our participation in the cpp and other government programs imposes restrictions and obligations on us that limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the equity capital markets 

the company has chosen to participate in a number of new programs sponsored by the us government during the current financial and economic crisis these programs including without limitation the tarp and its associated cpp as well as the arra and eesa and regulations thereunder contain important limitations on the company’s conduct of its business including limitations on dividends repurchases of common stock acquisitions and executive compensation these limitations may adversely impact the company’s ability to attract nongovernmental capital and to recruit and retain executive management and other personnel and its ability to compete with other american and foreign financial institutions one of these programs the cpp contains provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally modify any term or provision of contracts executed under the program 

  

recently adopted financial reform legislation will impose significant new limitations on our business activities and subject us to increased regulation and additional costs 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 will have material implications for the company and the entire financial services industry the act results in the company being defined as “systemically important” which brings significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements in addition among other things the act will or potentially could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as the act requires that many studies be conducted and that hundreds of regulations be written in order to fully implement it the full impact of this legislation on the company its business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years in addition the current political environment may lead in the near future to the adoption of new laws and regulations affecting financial institutions 

us regulatory agencies in response to the adoption of basel iii may require us to raise our capital and liquidity to levels that may exceed those that the market may otherwise consider to be optimal 

basel iii was adopted in december 2010 by the bcbs new capital and liquidity requirements are expected to be established by us regulatory agencies in response to basel iii which are higher than previous levels maintaining higher capital and liquidity levels may reduce our profitability and performance measures 

economic and other circumstances including pressure to repay cpp preferred stock may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

the company’s subsidiary banks must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by their banking regulators which can change depending upon general economic conditions and their particular condition risk profile and growth plans compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require capital investment from the parent in 2008 we issued shares of preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of the company’s common stock to the us treasury for 14 billion under tarp there may be increasing market regulatory or political pressure on the 

  

company to raise capital to enable it to repay the preferred stock issued to the us treasury under tarp at a time or in amounts that may be unfavorable to the company’s shareholders these uncertainties and risks created by the legislative and regulatory uncertainties discussed above may themselves increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

negative perceptions associated with our continued participation in the us treasury’s cpp may adversely affect our ability to retain customers attract investors and compete for new business opportunities 

several financial institutions which also participated in the cpp have repurchased their tarp preferred stock there can be no assurance as to the timing or manner in which the company may repurchase its series d preferred stock from the us treasury our customers employees and counterparties in our current and future business relationships could draw negative implications regarding the strength of the company as a financial institution based on our continued participation in the cpp following the exit of one or more of our competitors or other financial institutions any such negative perceptions could impair our ability to effectively compete with other financial institutions for business or to retain high performing employees if this were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

credit quality has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks the company’s credit quality continued at a weakened level during 2010 in most loan types and markets in which the company operates although most credit quality indicators improved during latter half of 2010 we expect continued credit quality weakness over the next few quarters 

weakness in the economy and in the real estate market including specific weakness within the markets where our subsidiary banks do business and within certain of our loan products has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

our credit exposure is one of our most significant risks the company’s level of problem credits remained high as of december 31 2010 the deterioration in credit quality that started in the latter half of 2007 has most significantly affected the construction and land development segment of our portfolio although virtually all of our markets and lending segments have been adversely affected by the economic recession the distress has been mostly concentrated in construction and land development loans in the southwest states generally arizona california and nevada which markets have been particularly adversely affected by job losses declines in residential and commercial sale volumes and real estate values and declines in new construction activity 

subsequent to the initial deterioration in construction and land development loans credit quality deterioration occurred in most loan types and geographies in which the company operated through the first half of 2010 as general economic conditions weakened throughout the country 

if the strength of the us economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we and our subsidiary banks conduct operations decline further this could result in among other things further deterioration in credit quality andor continued reduced demand for credit including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio an increase in chargeoffs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses if such developments occur we may be required to raise additional capital 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue the management of interest rate risk for the company and all bank subsidiaries is centralized and overseen by an asset liability management committee appointed by the company’s board of directors we have been successful in our interest rate risk 

  

management as evidenced by achieving a relatively stable net interest margin over the last several years when interest rates have been volatile and the rate environment challenging however a failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates subject to general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

our ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity has been and may continue to be adversely affected by market conditions 

we are required to maintain certain capital levels in accordance with banking regulations and any capital requirements imposed by our regulators we must also maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support our operations and fund outstanding liabilities our ability to maintain capital levels sources of funding and liquidity has been and could continue to be impacted by changes in the capital markets in which we operate and deteriorating economic and market conditions 

each of our subsidiary banks must remain wellcapitalized and meet certain other requirements for us to retain our status as a financial holding company failure to comply with those requirements could result in a loss of our financial holding company status if such conditions are not corrected within 180 days or such longer period as may be permitted by the federal reserve although we do not believe that the loss of such status would have an appreciable effect on our operations or financial results in addition failure by our bank subsidiaries to meet applicable capital guidelines or to satisfy certain other regulatory requirements can result in certain activity restrictions or a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities that include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic 

funding availability improved during 2010 as compared to 2009 as the company took a number of actions during the year to augment its capital and liquidity more emphasis was placed upon lowcost funding during 2010 than merely funding availability see “capital management” on page 84 in mda and notes 12 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on funding availability however because liquidity stresses are often a consequence of the materialization of other risks they will continue to be a risk factor in 2011 and beyond for the company the parent and its affiliate banks 

the quality and liquidity of our assetbacked investment securities portfolio has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

the company’s assetbacked investment securities portfolio includes cdos collateralized by trust preferred securities issued by banks insurance companies and reits that may have some exposure to construction loan commercial real estate and the subprime markets andor to other categories of distressed assets in addition assetbacked securities also include structured assetbacked cdos also known as diversified structured finance cdos which have exposure to subprime and home equity mortgage securitizations factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the fair value and impairment status of these securities these factors include but are not limited to defaults deferrals and restructurings by debt issuers rating agency downgrades of securities lack of market pricing of securities or the return of market pricing that varies from the company’s current model valuations and changes in prepayment rates and future interest rates see “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 for further details 

we have been unprofitable and may continue to be unprofitable and such lack of profitability could have particular adverse effects on us such as restricting our ability to pay dividends or requiring a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 

we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its banking and other subsidiaries as a result our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock will depend primarily 

  

upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries we and certain of our subsidiaries have been unprofitable during the last three annual reporting periods during 2009 and 2010 the noncash accelerated amortization expense caused by subordinated debt holders converting their debt to preferred stock has contributed to our unprofitability future conversions of subordinated debt into preferred stock may continue to contribute to unprofitability the ability of the company and our subsidiary banks to pay dividends is restricted by regulatory requirements including profitability and the need to maintain required levels of capital continuing lack of profitability exposes us to the risk that regulators could restrict the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends and our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock preferred stock or trust preferred securities it also increases the risk that the company may have to establish a “valuation allowance” against its net dta the parent and some of its subsidiary banks already have some disallowed dta for regulatory capital purposes 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us certain of our affiliates and particular classes of securities that we and our affiliates issue the interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we our affiliates andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies in the past rating agencies have downgraded our credit ratings further downgrades to us our affiliates or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities 

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the company provides to its customers and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements therefore pose an ongoing risk 

we could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings 

the company is subject to risks associated with legal claims fines litigation and regulatory proceedings the company’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the current economic environment new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes and the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations 

we could be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions 

from time to time the company makes acquisitions including the acquisition of assets and liabilities of failed banks from the fdic acting as a receiver the fdicsupported transactions are subject to loan loss sharing agreements failure to comply with the terms of the agreements could result in the loss of indemnification from the fdic the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the projected cost 

  

savings from the acquisition and on the continued growth and profitability of the acquisition target we have been successful with most prior acquisitions but it is possible that the merger integration process with an acquired company could result in the loss of key employees disruptions in controls procedures and policies or other factors that could affect our ability to realize the projected savings and successfully retain and grow the target’s customer base 

the company’s board of directors has established an enterprise risk management policy and has appointed an enterprise risk management committee to oversee and implement the policy in addition to credit and interest rate risk the committee also monitors the following risk areas market risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk information technology risk strategic risk compensationrelated risk and reputation risk

executive summary 

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 51 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is a “systemically important” financial institution under the doddfrank act 

 

  

  

  

  

 core longterm strategy 

we strive to maintain a local community bank approach for customerfacing elements of our business we believe that our target customers consisting largely of small and midsized businesses appreciate local branding product customization and speedy decisionmaking by local management by retaining a significant degree of autonomy in product offerings and pricing we believe our banks have a sustainable competitive advantage over larger national banks where loan and deposit products are often homogeneous however we strive to centralize noncustomer facing operations such as risk and capital management technology and operations by centralizing many of these functions we believe we can generally achieve greater economies of scale and stronger risk management and that our portfolio of community banks has superior access to the capital markets investment portfolio treasury management and liquidity resources and technological advances than do smaller independent community banks 

our growth strategy is driven by four key factors 

 

  

  

  

 focus on growth markets 

the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in growth markets the states in our geographic footprint have experienced higher rates of economic growth than other states our footprint is well diversified by industry strong business formation rates real estate development and general economic expansion while some states in our footprint have experienced a significant slowing in economic activity during the recent recession others have experienced aboveaverage growth and stronger resistance to the economic 

  

downturn we believe that the company can continue to experience aboveaverage revenue growth in the long term in part because the majority of our footprint is concentrated in states that have above average gdp population and job growth and where the economies are well diversified 

 

  

  

 keep decisions that affect customers local 

we believe that over the long term ensuring that local management teams retain the authority over decisions that affect their customers is a strategy that ultimately generates superior growth in our banking businesses as supported by stronger organic loan and deposit growth relative to other banks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 maintain a sustainable competitive advantage over community banks 

to create a sustainable competitive advantage over other smaller community banks we focus on achieving superior product selection productivity economies of scale availability of liquidity and a lower cost of capital compared to community banks 

 

  

  

  

   

centralize and standardize policies and management controlling key risks 

we seek to standardize policies and practices related to the management of key risks in order to assure a consistent risk profile in an otherwise decentralized management model among these key risks and functions are credit interest rate liquidity and market risks 

 

  

  

  

 management’s overview of 2010 performance

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies further explanations of significant accounting policies are included where applicable in the remaining notes to consolidated financial statements discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the company’s financial statements these critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements any changes to these amounts including changes in estimates may also be significant to the financial statements we believe that an understanding of certain of these policies along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included where applicable in this document sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities

the company measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measures asc 820 establishes a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and 3 unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

when observable market prices are not available fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset the related life of the asset and applicable growth rate the risk of nonperformance and other related assumptions 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc 825 financial instruments  

impairment analysis generally relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed 

investment securities are valued using several methodologies which depend on the nature of the security availability of current market information and other factors certain cdos are valued using an internal model and the assumptions are analyzed for sensitivity “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 provides more information regarding this analysis 

investment securities are reviewed formally on a quarterly basis for the presence of otti the evaluation process takes into account current market conditions fair value of the security and many other factors the decision to deem these securities otti is based on a specific analysis of the structure of each security and an evaluation of the underlying collateral future reviews for otti consider the particular facts and circumstances during the reporting period in review

allowance for credit losses 

the allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio but which have not been specifically identified the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios along with other relevant factors this process includes a quantitative analysis as well as a qualitative review of its results the qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgement and is described in more detail in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments provides for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the allowance for loan losses 

  

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses which includes a quantitative and a qualitative process although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses as an example if a total of 15 billion of pass grade loans were to be immediately classified as special mention substandard or doubtful as defined in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the same proportion as the existing criticized and classified loans to the whole portfolio the quantitatively determined amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2010 would increase by approximately 78 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in the level of the criticized and classified loans may have on the allowance estimation process 

although the qualitative process is subjective it represents the company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the allowance for loan losses such factors include but are not limited to national and regional economic trends and indicators we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the allowance for loan losses for the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 62 contain further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the allowance for credit losses 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other  we perform this annual test as of october 1 of each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit compares its fair value with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired 

to determine the fair value we generally calculate value using a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash or income flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we apply a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to benefit from synergies and other intangible assets that arise from control that might cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical recent bank transactions within the company’s geographic footprint comparing market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value we have determined that a control premium of 25 was appropriate 

  

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in revenue growth trends cost structures and technology changes in discount rates changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions as an example if the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100 basis points then the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank would only exceed their carrying values by 4 8 and 5 respectively this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact of a discount rate assumption change 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization effective october 1 2010 upon completion of the evaluation process we concluded that none of our subsidiary banks was impaired additionally we determined that the fair values of amegy cbt and zions bank exceeded their carrying values by 12 14 and 17 respectively 

notes 1 2 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contain additional information including recently issued accounting guidance that affects the calculation process 

accounting for derivatives 

our interest rate risk management strategy involves the use of hedging to mitigate our exposure to potential adverse effects from changes in interest rates 

the derivative contracts used by the company are exchangetraded or overthecounter “otc” exchangetraded derivatives consist of forward currency exchange contracts which are part of the company’s services provided to commercial customers otc derivatives consist of interest rate swaps options and futures contracts and through the third quarter of 2010 commodity derivatives for customers 

we record all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet in accordance with asc 815 derivative and hedging  when quoted market prices are not available the valuation of derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative these future net cash flows however are susceptible to change due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates most significantly foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as a result the estimated values of these derivatives will change over time as cash is received and paid and as market conditions change as these changes take place they may have a positive or negative impact on our estimated valuations 

we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both the company’s own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its otc derivatives in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings current threshold amounts mutual puts and guarantees additionally we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for significant changes 

notes 1 8 and 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “interest rate and market risk management” on page 74 contain further information on our use of derivatives and the methodologies used to estimate fair value 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where the company conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

  

the company had net deferred tax assets “dtas” of 540 million at december 31 2010 compared to 498 million at december 31 2009 the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the allowance for loan losses and 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2010 related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated despite the negative evidence of the past three years of losses the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to 1 carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods 2 implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible 3 utilize the reversal of deductible temporary differences that can be offset by taxable temporary differences and 4 generate future taxable income 

the company has available carryback potential to offset federal tax of approximately 100 million in the 2008 tax year during 2010 the company does anticipate a net operating loss for tax purposes that will largely offset the taxable income for the 2008 tax year 

tax planning strategies represent a source of positive evidence that must be considered when assessing the need for a valuation allowance tax planning strategies must be prudent and feasible and within the control of a company something that a company might not ordinarily implement but would implement to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in the realization of dtas the company has evaluated a number of tax planning strategies that if implemented could result in the realization of a majority of the net dta balance that exists at december 31 2010 these strategies mainly involve the sale of highly appreciated assets eg certain fixed assets publiclytraded securities and insurance policies management would not expect that the execution of any of the actions would involve a significant amount of expense 

the company has taxable temporary differences or deferred tax liabilities “dtls” that will reverse and offset dtas in the periods prior to the expiration of any benefits based on our analysis and experience the general reversal pattern of dtls against dtas would be somewhat similar in character and timing because of this generally consistent reversal pattern we believe it is appropriate to reduce our gross dtas by our dtls 

the company has a strong history of positive earnings and has generated significant levels of net income in 42 out of the previous 46 years while the recent economic downturn has been severe the company has consistently maintained strong levels of “core net interest income” the company is well positioned in the highest growth areas in the country and is fundamentally strong in its capital liquidity business practices and has actually grown its customer base during the current economic downturn the company has a long history of profitability and is expected to be profitable again in the near future the company is relying on future taxable income to realize some of its dta and expects to generate this income beginning in 2011 

after evaluating all of the factors previously summarized and considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits the company has tax reserves at december 31 2010 of approximately 53 million net of federal andor state benefits for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted where applicable the other notes to consolidated financial statements and mda discuss new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2010 to the extent they materially affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

results of operations 

the company reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2010 of 4125 million or 248 per diluted share compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of 12344 million or 992 per diluted share for 2009 the significant reduction in net loss was mainly caused by the following favorable changes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the impact of these items was partially offset by the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the company reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2009 of 12344 million or 992 per diluted share compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of 2907 million or 268 per diluted share for 2008 the significant increase in net loss was mainly caused by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the impact of these unfavorable changes was partially offset by the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2009 the company executed a subordinated debt modification and exchange transaction the original discount on the convertible subordinated debt was 679 million and the remaining discount at december 31 2010 was 386 million it included the following components 

 

  

 the discount associated with the convertible subordinated debt is amortized to interest expense a noncash expense using the interest method over the remaining terms of the subordinated debt when holders of the convertible subordinated notes convert to preferred stock the rate of amortization is accelerated by immediately expensing any unamortized discount associated with the converted debt 

excluding the impact of these noncash expenses and the 2009 gain on subordinated debt modification the loss before income taxes decreased to 1728 million in 2010 from 20693 million in 2009 and has improved each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2009

 the impact of the conversion of subordinated debt into preferred stock is further detailed in “capital management” on page 84 

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestbearing assets and interest incurred on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest component of zions’ revenue for the year 2010 it was 799 of our taxableequivalent revenues compared to 705 in 2009 and 913 in 2008 the change in the percentage from the prior year for 2010 and 2009 was primarily due to the 2009 gain on subordinated debt modification of 5089 million and acquisition related gains of 1692 million which increased total taxableequivalent revenues in 2009 for the year 2010 taxableequivalent net interest income was 17491 million compared to 19208 million in 2009 and 19954 million in 2008 the fluctuation between 2010 and 2009 reflects the effect of many factors including a decrease in loans and leases lower balances of and lower rates earned on securities and higher noncash periodic and accelerated discount amortization totaling 2304 million in 2010 on convertible subordinated debt partially offset by lower balances of and lower interest rates paid on interest bearing deposits increased money market investments as well as betterthanexpected performance of loans acquired from the fdic even though nonaccrual loans decreased by 358  between 2009 and 2010 their positive impact only partially offset the adverse impact of continued paydowns and chargeoffs on earning assets the decrease between 2008 and 2009 was largely the result of increased nonaccrual loans securities on nonaccrual status and higher average money market balances that were earning lower interest rates the incremental tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all years discussed and presented 

by its nature net interest income is especially vulnerable to changes in the mix and amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in the interest rates and yields associated with these assets and liabilities can significantly impact net interest income during 2010 customer deposits declined by a smaller amount than did loan balances the company has undertaken efforts to actively reduce the excess liquidity while preserving key customer relationships see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 74 for further discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and associated risk 

a gauge that we use to measure the company’s success in managing its net interest income is the level and stability of the net interest margin the company also considers the “core net interest margin” to be relevant to ongoing operating results the net interest margin was 373 for 2010 compared to 394 in 2009 and 418 in 2008 during 2010 the net interest margin was negatively impacted by 37 basis points by the accelerated discount amortization resulting from the conversion of convertible subordinated debt to preferred stock and by 12 basis points for the discount amortization related to the convertible subordinated debt this unfavorable 

  

impact was partially mitigated by increased interest income resulting from the accretion on acquired loans based on increased projected cash flows and by the low cost of noninterestbearing deposit funding 

the decreased net interest margin for 2010 compared to 2009 resulted from the impact of the discount amortization on the modified subordinated debt including the effect of the conversion of subordinated debt into preferred stock increased nonaccrual loans and securities and higher money market investment balances earning lower rates this was offset in part by a lower cost mix of deposit funding lower rates paid on interestbearing deposits and larger incremental spreads on new loan generation average loans and leases decreased 33 billion due to loan payoffs and chargeoffs and average money market investments increased 17 billion as the company chose not to invest excess liquidity in longerduration securities average interestbearing deposits decreased 34 billion from 2009 with the decrease being driven primarily by time and money market deposits average borrowed funds decreased 16 billion compared to 2009 primarily due to reduced amounts of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements along with conversions of subordinated debt into preferred stock average noninterestbearing deposits increased 23 billion compared to 2009 and were 319 of total average deposits for 2010 compared to 258 for 2009 

the decreased net interest margin for 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from increased nonaccrual loans and securities the impact of the discount amortization on the modified subordinated debt including the effect of the conversion of subordinated debt into series c preferred stock and higher money market investment balances earning lower rates this was offset in part by a lower cost mix of deposit funding lower rates paid on interestbearing deposits and larger incremental spreads on new loan generation average loans and leases increased 07 billion due to the acquisition of fdicsupported loans and average money market investments increased 05 billion due to strong growth in certain deposit categories which the company chose not to invest in longerduration securities average interestbearing deposits increased 34 billion from 2008 with the increase being driven primarily by money market and savings deposits average borrowed funds decreased 53 billion compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased borrowing from the fhlb and the federal reserve average noninterestbearing deposits increased 19 billion compared to 2008 and were 258 of total average deposits for 2009 compared to 243 for 2008 the net interest margin for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by 6 basis points for the discount amortization on the modified subordinated debt and an additional 7 basis points from the impact of accelerated debt discount amortization resulting from the conversion of subordinated debt into series c preferred stock 

the company believes that its “core net interest margin” is more reflective of its operating performance than the reported net interest margin the “core net interest margin” is calculated by excluding the impact of discount amortization on convertible subordinated debt accelerated discount amortization on convertible subordinated debt and additional accretion of interest income on loans acquired in fdicassisted transactions from the net interest margin the “core net interest margin” was 412 407 and 418 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see “gaap to nongaap reconciliation” on page 88 for a reconciliation between the gaap net interest margin and the nongaap “core net interest margin” 

  

chart 4 illustrates recent trends of the net interest margin “core net interest margin” and the average federal funds rate 

the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2010 was 312 compared to 352 for 2009 and 368 for 2008 the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2010 was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the net interest margin 

the net interest margin may continue to be adversely affected in future quarters due to the level of nonperforming assets and the periodic amortization of debt discount related to the debt modification transactions the discount on the convertible subordinated debt was 386 million as of december 31 2010 or 481 of the total 803 million of remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes and will be amortized as interest expense over the remaining life of the debt using the interest method the net interest margin may also be negatively impacted in future periods if debt holders exercise their option to convert debt securities into preferred stock the company will be required to amortize the remaining discount related to the converted debt at the time of conversion 

the company expects to continue its efforts over the long run to maintain a slightly “assetsensitive” position with regard to interest rate risk however because of the current low interest rate environment the company has allowed its balance sheet to become more assetsensitive than has historically been the case with interest rates at historically low levels there is also a reduced need to protect against falling interest rates our estimates of the company’s actual rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates balance sheet composition and other modeling assumptions as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “interest rate risk” on page 75 

schedule 3 summarizes the average balances the amount of interest earned or incurred and the applicable yields for interestearning assets and the costs of interestbearing liabilities that generate taxableequivalent net interest income note that the “amount of interest” and the “average rate” paid on longterm debt in 2009 and 2010 reflect the impacts of the amortization and accelerated amortization of the discount on the modified subordinated debt

analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate 

 

  

  in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate changes due to the volumerate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate both increase the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate when the rate increases and volume decreases the variance is allocated to the rate 

  

provisions for credit losses 

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that in our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based upon our estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks associated with such commitments in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs and statistical trends and other economic factors see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and “credit risk management” on page 62 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

the provision for loan losses for the year ended december 31 2010 was 8521 million compared to 20169 million in 2009 and 6483 million in 2008 the decrease in the provision for 2010 reflected an improvement in the credit quality metrics of the loan portfolio including lower levels of criticized and classified loans lower realized loss content in the loan segments and lower balances in construction and land development loans which declined by 358 from 2009 the increased provision for 2009 was attributable to a higher level of criticized and classified loans higher realized loss content in these loan segments and continued deterioration in collateral values primarily in construction and land development loans 

net loan and lease chargeoffs fell to 9689 million in 2010 compared to 11726 million in 2009 and 3937 million in 2008 see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “nonperforming assets” on page 69 and “allowance and reserve for credit losses” on page 73 for further details 

the provision for unfunded lending commitments was 47 million for 2010 as a result of improving credit quality of such commitments the provision was 655 million in 2009 and 14 million in 2008 from period to period the amounts of unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizeable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments originations and funding as well as historical loss experience 

although the quality of the loan portfolio continues to be a concern most measures of credit quality showed significant improvement in the second half of 2010 but with variations among geographies and loan types in 2010 the company also experienced a decrease in special mention classified nonaccrual and past due loans as well as improvements in other credit metrics the company’s expectation is that credit costs will improve in 2011 due to significant reductions in loan balances in loan categories that have exhibited higher loss rates such as construction and land development loans we also anticipate reductions in criticized and classified loans of most types and expect stabilization of economic conditions as a result we expect continued reduction in the levels of provisioning and net chargeoffs for at least the next several quarters compared to the recent elevated levels 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues the company earns for products and services that have no interest rate or yield associated with them noninterest income for 2010 was 4405 million compared to 8041 million and 1907 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively schedule 5 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

  

schedule 5 

noninterest income 

 

 service charges and fees on deposit accounts decreased by 129 million or 61 from 2009 this decline is a reflection of the decrease in deposits as well as a decrease in nonsufficientfunds and overdraft fees due to changes in regulation e service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by 56 million between 2008 and 2009 largely due to the additional accounts obtained through the acquisition of three failed banks from the fdic as well as reduced business deposit account earnings credits caused by lower interest rates 

other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of atm fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit card interchange fees cash management fees lending commitment fees syndication and servicing fees and other miscellaneous fees increased by 88 million or 56 from 2009 the increase was mostly due to increased loan atm debit card and bankcard fees partially offset by decreased licensing fees and mutual fund commissions the decrease in licensing fees is primarily attributable to the sale of netdeposit’s assets 

other service charges commissions and fees decreased 112 million or 67 during 2009 compared to 2008 this was mostly due to lower lending related fees official check fees mutual fund commission fees and cash management related fees offset by increased accounts receivable factoring fees 

capital markets and foreign exchange includes trading income public finance fees foreign exchange income and other capital market related fees in 2010 this income decreased to 376 million from 503 million and 499 million earned in 2009 and 2008 respectively most of the decline from 2009 to 2010 was caused by decreases in commissions and trading income the fluctuation from 2008 to 2009 was primarily driven by increased trading income partially offset by lower public finance fees 

dividends and other investment income consist of revenue from the company’s bankowned life insurance program and revenues from other investments revenues from other investments include dividends on fhlb 

  

stock federal reserve bank stock and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates including certain alternative venture investments dividends and other investment income increased by 65 million in 2010 compared to 2009 for the most part the increase was caused by increased income from investments in several unconsolidated affiliates and an increase in dividends on federal reserve stock partially offset by decreased income from bankowned life insurance contracts income from bankowned life insurance decreased due to the company surrendering certain life insurance contracts during 2010 

dividends and other investment income was 266 million in 2009 and 464 million in 2008 the decline in 2009 was primarily due to a 147 million decrease in earnings from amegy’s alternative investments program a 144 million decrease in earnings from two investment funds and a 57 million decrease in dividends on fhlb stock additionally revenue from bankowned life insurance programs decreased to 251 million during 2009 from 307 million in 2008 these decreases were somewhat offset by a 136 million increase in equity in earnings of farmer mac and a 71 million increase in dividends and equity in earnings on other investments 

fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss consists of the following 

schedule 6 

fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss 

 

 during 2010 the company terminated fewer cash flow hedges than in 2009 nonhedge derivative income included 90 million in 2010 and 1047 million in 2009 due to the acceleration of income from oci to earnings for certain terminated cash flow hedges the amount accelerated in 2009 was due to declining loan balances which caused the reclassification to earnings of 100 of the oci balances for many of the terminated hedges there were fewer reclassifications in 2010 in 2010 the company also recorded 228 million of negative fair value on the trs agreement entered into during the third quarter 

net gains from fixed income securities were 111 million in 2010 compared to a net loss of 38 million in 2009 most of the gains realized in 2010 are attributable to the sale of certain auction rate securities which were redeemed from customers in 2009 these securities were previously written down but sold at par 

the company recognized net impairment losses on investment securities of 854 million during 2010 compared to 2805 million and 3040 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the total impairment loss for 2010 was 1565 million and included 711 million of noncreditrelated otti which was charged against oci these otti losses were primarily from certain cdos including bank and insurance cdos see “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 for additional information including certain changes in modeling assumptions 

valuation losses on securities purchased in 2009 consisted of 1879 million from purchases of securities from lockhart prior to fully consolidating lockhart in june 2009 and 242 million for valuation adjustments to auction rate securities which were purchased from customers during the first quarter of 2009 

in 2009 the company recorded a gain on subordinated debt modification of 5089 million the company exchanged approximately 200 million of subordinated notes for new notes with the same terms the remaining 12 billion of subordinated notes were modified to permit conversion on a par for par basis into either the company’s series a or series c preferred stock 

  

acquisition related gains of 1692 million in 2009 resulted from the company’s acquisition of failed banks from the fdic with loss sharing agreements the company recognized 1465 million of gains resulting from the acquisition of vineyard bank acquired from the fdic on july 17 2009 the remaining 227 million of acquisition related gains were from the acquisitions of the failed alliance bank on february 6 2009 by cbt and great basin bank on april 17 2009 by nsb the gains resulted from the acquisition of assets that had fair values in excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed 

during 2010 the company exchanged 556 million of nonconvertible subordinated debt for 2165391 shares of common stock resulting in a 145 million gain 

other noninterest income in 2010 reached 295 million compared to 121 million in 2009 and 211 million in 2008 the increase in 2010 included a 137 million pretax gain from the sale of substantially all of the assets of a whollyowned subsidiary netdeposit llc to bserv inc 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense grew by only 28 from 2009 which was 133 higher than in 2008 the company was successful in controlling many operational expense categories which helped in offsetting the impact of increased costs incurred in credit management and resolution of problem loans schedule 7 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years

 during 2010 salary costs increased by only 25 from 2009 base salaries remained constant but the company’s employees earned higher bonuses and incentives in 2009 salary costs were 20 lower than in 2008 mainly from reduced variable pay and staff reductions the salary costs for 2009 also included sharebased compensation expense of approximately 298 million down from 318 million for 2008 employee health and insurance benefits declined by 171 during 2010 mostly caused by a reduction in the accrual for incurredbutnotyetreported health care claims the 2009 expense increased by 379 from 2008 mainly due to higher health care costs from catastrophic claims 

salaries and employee benefits are shown in greater detail in schedule 8

salaries and employee benefits 

 

 other real estate expense increased to 1448 million in 2010 compared to 1108 million in 2009 and 504 million in 2008 the increase is primarily due to higher volumes of foreclosed properties added to oreo and continued declines in real estate values which resulted in increased writedowns of oreo during workout partially offset by an increase in net gains from some property sales oreo expenses increased at zions bank amegy nba and vectra and decreased at nsb and cbt 

credit related expense includes costs incurred during the foreclosure process prior to the company obtaining title to collateral and recording an asset in oreo as well as other outofpocket costs related to the management of problem loans and other assets these costs were 712 million in 2010 compared to 450 million and 241 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the increased costs during these three years are a reflection of the company’s higher levels of problem loans and its efforts to resolve them 

fdic premiums were essentially unchanged between 2009 and 2010 during 2009 these premiums increased 806 million or 4050 compared to 2008 due to increased premium rates and a “onetime” special assessment charged by the fdic 

other noninterest expense for 2010 amounted to 2758 million compared to 2269 million and 2450 million during 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase was mostly caused by a onetime structuring fee related to the trs transaction and writedowns of the fdic indemnification asset attributable to loans purchased from the fdic during 2009 fdicsupported loans have performed better than expected and therefore the indemnification asset has declined in value also during 2010 we accrued 80 million for an expected nontax deductible civil money penalty related to alleged violations of the bank secrecy act expected to be assessed by the occ and the us treasury department’s fincen bureau a penalty of this amount was consented to by the company and announced by the occ and fincen on february 11 2011 

impairment losses on goodwill 

the company performed a goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2010 and concluded that no impairment losses existed in 2009 the company recorded 6362 million of impairment losses almost entirely at amegy during 2008 impairment losses totaled 3538 million and occurred at nba vectra nsb and other reporting units 

the primary causes of the impairment losses on goodwill in 2009 and 2008 at the company’s banking reporting units were declines in market values of comparable companies and reduced earnings at the reporting units which resulted primarily from deterioration in credit quality of the loan portfolios see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “accounting for goodwill” on page 30 for additional information 

  

foreign operations 

zions bank cbt amegy vectra and cbw operate foreign branches in grand cayman grand cayman islands bwi the branches only accept deposits from qualified domestic customers while deposits in these branches are not subject to frb reserve requirements or fdic insurance premiums there are no federal or state income tax benefits to the company or any customers as a result of these operations 

foreign deposits at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 totaled 17 billion 17 billion and 26 billion respectively and averaged 16 billion for 2010 20 billion for 2009 and 32 billion for 2008 all of these foreign deposits were related to domestic customers of the banks in addition the company had foreign loan balances totaling 110 million 65 million and 43 million at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

income taxes 

the company’s income tax benefit for 2010 was 1068 million compared to an income tax benefit of 4013 million and 434 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively the company’s effective income tax rates including the effects of noncontrolling interests were 267 in 2010 248 in 2009 and 140 in 2008 the tax benefit rate for 2010 was reduced by the taxable surrender of certain bankowned life insurance policies and the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock during the year the lower tax rates for both 2009 and 2008 are mainly due to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges incurred during the year the 2009 effective tax rate was higher than in 2008 primarily due to the smaller impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in proportion to overall loss before income taxes during 2008 the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 96 million net of any federal andor state tax benefits of this reduction 52 million decreased the company’s tax expense for 2008 and 44 million reduced taxrelated balance sheet accounts 

as discussed in previous filings the company has received federal income tax credits under the us government’s community development financial institutions fund that are recognized over a sevenyear period from the year of investment the effect of these tax credits was to increase income tax benefit by 60 million in 2010 59 million in 2009 and 58 million in 2008 

the company had a dta balance of approximately 540 million at december 31 2010 compared to 498 million at december 31 2009 the increase in the net dta resulted primarily from items related to nonaccruing loans oreo and the decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to fdicsupported transaction items and the nondeductibility of a portion of the accelerated discount amortization from the conversion of subordinated debt to preferred stock the company did not record a valuation allowance for gaap purposes as of december 31 2010 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 28 for more information

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities loans and leases schedule 3 which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of the company’s interest earning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields another one of our goals is to maintain a higheryielding mix of interest earning assets such as loans relative to loweryielding assets such as money market investments and securities the current period of slow economic growth accompanied by low demand throughout 2009 and much of 2010 has made it difficult to consistently achieve these goals 

average interestearning assets declined by 39 to 469 billion in 2010 compared to 488 billion in 2009 mainly driven by decreases in the average loan and securities portfolios however average interestearning assets as a percentage of total average assets increased slightly during 2010 to 908 compared to 902 in 2009 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold and security resell agreements increased by 716 to 41 billion in 2010 compared to 24 billion in 2009 the increase in average money market investments reflects the increase in the company’s liquidity during 2010 average securities decreased by 66 and average net loans and leases decreased by 79 for 2010 when compared to 2009 these changes are primarily the result of weak customer demand for new and refinanced loans

investment securities portfolio 

we invest in securities both to generate revenues for the company and to manage liquidity the following schedules present a profile of the company’s investment portfolios with assetbacked securities classified by credit ratings the amortized cost amounts represent the company’s original cost for the investments adjusted for accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments related to the security and credit impairment losses the estimated fair value measurement levels and methodology are discussed in detail in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

schedules 10 and 11 present the company’s assetbacked securities classified by the highest of the ratings and the lowest of the ratings from any of moody’s investors service fitch ratings or standard  poors 

in the discussion of our investment portfolio below we have included certain credit rating information because the information is one indication of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed and significant changes in ratings classifications for our investment portfolio could indicate an increased level of risk for the company

schedule 12 

investment securities portfolio 

 

 the amortized cost of investment securities at december 31 2010 increased by 97 from the previous year this was primarily due to increased investments in short term us treasury securities agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities and small business administration loanbacked securities partially offset by decreased investments in auction rate securities mutual funds and stocks as well as municipal securities 

the amortized cost of investment securities increased by 87 during 2009 this change was largely due to zions bank purchasing securities from lockhart 678 million the company purchasing auction rate securities from customers 237 million securities acquired in the fdicassisted acquisitions of the failed alliance great basin and vineyard banks 182 million and the impact of the 2009 provisions of acs 320 230 million offset by otti credit impairment valuation losses on security purchases and security maturity paydowns 

at december 31 2010 222 of the 42 billion of fair value of availableforsale securities portfolio was valued at level 1 430 was valued at level 2 and 348 was valued at level 3 under the gaap fair value accounting valuation hierarchy a year earlier the fair value of availableforsale securities totaled 37 billion of which 104 was valued at level 1 439 at level 2 and 457 at level 3 see note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value accounting 

  

the amortized cost of availableforsale investment securities valued at level 3 was 2217 million at december 31 2010 and the fair value of these securities was 1462 million the securities valued at level 3 were comprised of abs cdos and auction rate securities for these level 3 securities net pretax unrealized loss recognized in oci at the end of 2010 was 755 million as of december 31 2010 we believe that we will receive on settlement or maturity the amortized cost amounts of the level 3 availableforsale securities for which no otti was recognized 

at the end of 2009 the securities valued at level 3 also included abs cdos and auction rate securities the amortized cost of these investments was 2413 million their fair value was 1670 million and the related net pretax unrealized loss which was recognized in oci at december 31 2009 amounted to 743 million 

valuation and sensitivity analysis of level 3 bank and insurance cdos 

the following schedule sets forth the sensitivity of the current cdo fair values using an internal model to changes in the most significant assumptions utilized in the model 

schedule 13 

sensitivity of internal model 

 

  

      

the 2010 sensitivity analysis of valuation assumptions when compared to the same projection for 2009 was consistent with changes the company experienced in the loss percentage from currently defaulted or deferring collateral the changes were driven by loss experience due to default as well as generally lower future loss projections from deferring institutions this was offset by an assumption change which raised annual default rates to a minimum of 030 per year for years 6 to maturity to be consistent with the long term historical bank failure rate 

during 2010 the company recognized creditrelated net impairment losses on cdos of 854 million compared to losses of 2805 million and 3040 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively the doddfrank act became effective during the third quarter of 2010 and it disallows the inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier 1 capital we believe that this may prompt certain issuing banks to redeem their trust preferred securities early and have therefore changed some of our assumptions used in estimating the fair values of cdo securities of the 854 million net impairment losses recognized in 2010 116 million were the result of this change in modeling assumptions 

schedules 14 and 15 provide additional information on the belowinvestmentgrade rated bank and insurance trust preferred cdos’ portion of the afs and htm portfolios the schedules include aggregate data on those securities which have been determined to not have otti at december 31 2010 and those which have been determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired at or prior to december 31 2010 the schedules utilize the lowest rating to identify those securities below investment grade the schedules segment the securities by original ratings level to provide granularity on the seniority level of the securities and the distribution of unrealized losses and on poollevel performance and projections the best and worst poollevel statistic for each original ratings subgroup is presented not the best and worst single security within the original ratings grouping the number of issuers and number of currently performing issuers noted in schedule 15 are from the same security the remaining statistics may not be from the same security

the company’s loss and recovery experience as of december 31 2010 and our level 3 modeling assumption is essentially a 100 loss on defaults although we have to date received several generally small recoveries on defaults our experience with deferring bank collateral has been that of all collateral that has elected to defer beginning in 2007 or thereafter 453 has defaulted and approximately 521 remains within the allowable deferrable period older deferrals are more likely to have defaulted approximately 86 of the bank collateral which first deferred prior to january 1 2009 had defaulted by december 31 2010 for bank collateral which first deferred on or after january 1 2009 29 had defaulted by december 31 2010 seven issuing banks with collateral aggregating to 26 of all deferrals have come current and resumed interest payments on their trust preferred securities after previously deferring some payments new deferrals peaked in 2009 in 2008 92 of collateral performing at the start of the year elected to defer by year end this contrasts with 191 in 2009 and 100 in 2010 

schedule 16 also presents information regarding the investment securities portfolio this schedule presents the maturities of the different types of investments that the company owned as of december 31 2010 and the corresponding average interest rates that the investments will yield if they are held to maturity it should be noted that most of the sba loanbacked securities and assetbacked securities are variable rate and their repricing periods are significantly less than their contractual maturities also see “liquidity risk” on page 79 and notes 1 5 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s investment securities and their management

as shown in schedule 17 below the investment securities portfolio at december 31 2010 includes 612 million of nonrated fixedincome securities compared to 654 million at december 31 2009 nonrated municipal securities held in the portfolio were underwritten by zions bank’s municipal credit department in accordance with its established municipal credit standards

 loans held for sale 

loans held for sale consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market were 206 million at december 31 2010 compared with 209 million at december 31 2009 the consumer loans are primarily fixed rate mortgages that are originated and sold to third parties 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2010 net loans and leases accounted for 720 of total assets compared to 786 at the end of 2009 schedule 18 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2010 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in certain cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 75 

  

schedule 18 

loan portfolio by type and maturity 

 

  

during 2008 the company completed a loan classification project information to reclassify loans for periods prior to 2007 is not available 

as of december 31 2010 net loans and leases were 367 billion reflecting an 86 decline from 2009 the decrease is primarily due to paydowns and chargeoffs which continue to more than offset new loan originations 

most of the loan portfolio contraction during 2010 occurred in commercial real estate construction and land development loans owner occupied and fdicsupported loans the company focused its efforts to reduce exposure to high risk construction and land development loans and the demand for such loans has decreased due to the current economic conditions the largest reductions occurred principally at amegy zions bank nba and cbt the company also experienced significant decreases in commercial lending balances principally at zions bank vectra and cbt 

we expect that construction and land development loans will continue to decline as the company has intentionally reduced lending for these types of projects and demand remains weak 

other noninterestbearing investments 

as of december 31 2010 the company had 858 million of other noninterestbearing investments compared with 1100 million in 2009 the decrease resulted mainly from decreased investments in bankowned life insurance contracts and in sbic investments the life insurance contracts were surrendered as a part of the company’s strategy to become more asset sensitive and to reduce its investment in very longterm illiquid assets at affiliate banks 

  

schedule 19 

other noninterestbearing investments 

 

  

  deposits 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company average total deposits decreased by 26 during 2010 with average interestbearing deposits decreasing by 106 and average noninterestbearing deposits increasing by 205 the decline in deposits resulted from actions by the company to reduce higher cost deposits including time deposits and brokered deposits as well as to reduce excess noninterestbearing deposits held by some large customers through the use of offbalance sheet sweep products core deposits at december 31 2010 which exclude time deposits larger than 100000 and brokered deposits increased by 25 or 915 million from december 31 2009 the fluctuation was due to increases in noninterestbearing deposits and savings and now deposits partially offset by decreases in money market and time deposits under 100000 

demand savings and money market deposits comprised 858 of total deposits at the end of 2010 compared with 826 at december 31 2009 

during 2010 the company reduced brokered deposits due to excess liquidity and weak loan demand at december 31 2010 total deposits included 435 million of brokered deposits compared to 1608 million at december 31 2009 

see notes 11 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity risk” on page 79 for additional information on funding and borrowed funds 

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower guarantor or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

  

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through a uniform credit policy credit administration and credit exam functions at the parent effective management of credit risk is essential in maintaining a safe sound and profitable financial institution we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and the independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio further an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to management and to the credit review committee of the board of directors new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by a new product review committee at the bank level or parent level depending on the inherent risk of the new activity 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each affiliate bank is able to modify corporate credit policy to be more conservative however corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to create a more liberal policy historically only a limited number of such modifications have been approved this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

with regard to credit risk associated with counterparties to offbalance sheet credit instruments zions bank and amegy have isda agreements in place under which derivative transactions are entered into with major derivative dealers each isda agreement details the cash collateral arrangements between zions bank and amegy and their counterparties in every case the amount of the cash collateral required to secure the exposed party in the derivative transaction is determined by the fair value of the derivative and the credit rating of the party with the obligation the credit rating used in these situations is provided by either moody’s or standard  poor’s this means that in like transactions a counterparty with a “aaa” rating would be obligated to provide less collateral to secure a major credit exposure than one with an “a” rating all derivative gains and losses between zions bank or amegy and a single counterparty are netted to determine the net credit exposure and therefore the collateral required any derivative transactions for affiliate banks other than zions bank or amegy as well as certain derivatives transactions entered into by amegy after its acquisition by the company are handled through intercompany isda agreements such that the relevant affiliate faces zions bank and in turn zions bank faces the derivatives dealer 

the company’s credit risk management strategy includes diversification of its loan portfolio the company maintains a diversified loan portfolio which includes commercial real estate loans the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty during 2009 the company adopted new concentration limits on various types of commercial real estate lending particularly construction and land development lending which have contributed to further reducing the company’s exposure to this type of lending the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers located within the geographical footprint of its banking subsidiaries 

as displayed in schedule 20 at the end of 2010 no single loan type exceeded 249 of the company’s total loan portfolio during 2010 construction and land development decreased to 97 of total loans compared to 138 at the end of 2009 

  

schedule 20 

loan portfolio diversification 

 

 the company’s loan portfolio includes loans that were acquired from failed banks alliance bank great basin bank and vineyard bank these loans include nonperforming loans and other loans with characteristics indicative of a high credit risk profile including substantial concentrations in california and nevada loans with homebuilders and other construction finance loans most of these loans are covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic for which the fdic generally will assume 80 of the first 275 million of credit losses for the alliance bank assets 40 million of credit losses for the great basin bank assets and 465 million of credit losses for the vineyard bank assets and 95 of any credit losses in excess of those amounts therefore the company’s financial exposure to losses from these assets is substantially limited and during 2010 the acquired loans performed better than expected fdicsupported loans represented approximately 26 and 36 of the company’s total loan portfolio at the end of 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the credit quality of the company’s loan portfolio began to show signs of stabilization and improvement during the latter half of 2010 nonperforming lending related assets decreased by 340 from december 31 2009 gross chargeoffs dropped to 1074 million compared to 1256 million in 2009 net chargeoffs in turn decreased to 969 million in 2010 from 1173 million in 2009 

lending to finance residential land acquisition development and construction has historically been an important business for the company however during 2010 the company intentionally reduced its portfolio of these types of loans stricter mortgage qualification standards high unemployment declining home values and general uncertainty in the residential real estate market continues to have an adverse impact on the operations of many of the company’s developer and builder customers

approximately 33 of the commercial real estate term loans consist of miniperm loans for such loans construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a miniperm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards miniperm loans generally have initial maturities of 3 to 7 years the remaining 67 of commercial real estate loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 15 to 20 years the stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and includes for example criteria related to the cash flow created by the project and occupancy rates 

approximately 297 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio’s balance consists of acquisition and development loans most of these acquisition and development properties are tied to specific retail apartment office or other projects underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness of the sponsor we generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected economics of the project are primary in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily projects we look for substantial preleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 120 

although lending for residential construction and development deals with a different product type many of the requirements previously mentioned such as credit worthiness of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity remargining requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan heavy consideration is given to market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made loan agreements generally include limitations on the number of model homes and homes built on a spec basis with preference given to presold homes 

real estate appraisals are ordered independently of the credit officer and the borrower generally by each bank’s appraisal review function which is staffed by certified appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used appraisals are ordered from outside appraisers at the inception renewal or for cre loans upon the occurrence of any event causing a “criticized” or “classified” grade to be assigned to the credit the frequency for obtaining updated appraisals for these adversely graded credits is increased when declining market conditions exist advance rates on an “as completed basis” will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but corporate guidelines generally limit advances to 50 for raw land 65 for land development 65 for finished commercial lots 75 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 75 for models and spec homes and 75 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of these schedules is closely monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally the frequency of loanbyloan reviews of pass grade loans has been increased to quarterly for all commercial and residential construction and land development loans at zions bank cbt amegy nba nsb and vectra 

interest reserves generally are established as an expense item in the budget for real estate construction or development loans we generally require the borrower to put their equity into the project at the inception of the construction this enables the bank to ensure the availability of equity in the project the company’s practice is to monitor the construction sales andor leasing progress to determine whether or not the project remains viable if at any time during the life of the credit the project is determined not to be viable the bank takes appropriate action to protect its collateral position via negotiation andor legal action as deemed necessary the bank then usually evaluates the proper use of interest reserves at december 31 2010 zions’ affiliates had 341 loans with 

  

outstanding balances of 423 million where available interest reserves amounted to 42 million at the end of 2009 they had had 416 loans with outstanding balances of 10 billion and related available interest reserves of 106 million in instances where projects have been determined not to be viable the interest reserves and other appropriate disbursements have been frozen 

we have not been involved to any meaningful extent with insurance arrangements credit derivatives or any other default agreements as a mitigation strategy for commercial real estate loans however we do make use of personal or other guarantees as risk mitigation strategies 

the company periodically stress tests its cre loan portfolio using a loanbyloan monte carlo simulation that stresses the probability of default and loss given default for cre loans based on a variety of factors including regional economic factors loan grade loantovalue collateral type and geography this testing is back tested and the results are reviewed regularly with management rating agencies and various banking regulators 

consumer loans 

the company did not pursue subprime residential mortgage lending including option arm and negative amortization loans it does have approximately 383 million of stated income loans with generally high fico scores at origination including “onetime close” loans to finance the construction of a home which convert into permanent jumbo mortgages as of december 31 2010 approximately 56 million of the 383 million of stated income loans had fico scores of less than 620 these totals exclude heldforsale loans stated income loans account for approximately 19 million or 35 of our credit losses in 14 family residential first mortgage loans during 2010 and were primarily in utah and arizona 

the company has mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages generally considered to be of prime quality its practice historically has been to sell “conforming” fixed rate loans to third parties including fannie mae and freddie mac for which it makes representations and warranties as to meeting certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards it has also been the company’s practice historically to hold variable rate loans in its portfolio in the past two years fannie mae and freddie mac have successfully “put back” to the company’s subsidiary banks fewer than ten loans due to deficiencies in underwriting or loan documentation in addition the company has not made use of socalled “robosigners” in foreclosing on residential real estate and it has not been subject to any foreclosure moratorium – whether selfimposed or imposed by others the company does not estimate that it has any material financial risk as a result of loan putbacks or its foreclosure practices and has not established any reserves related to these items 

the company is engaged in home equity credit line lending approximately 931 million of the company’s 21 billion portfolio is secured by first deeds of trust while the remaining balance is secured by junior liens as of december 31 2010 loans representing approximately 148 of the outstanding balance in this portfolio were estimated to have loantovalue ratios above 100 of the total home equity credit line portfolio 041 was 90 or more days past due at december 31 2010 as compared to 042 as of december 31 2009 during 2010 the company modified a nominal number of home equity loans the credit losses for this portfolio were 129 basis points for the year ended december 31 2010 

nonperforming assets 

total nonperforming lending related assets were 1828 million at december 31 2010 compared to 2769 million at december 31 2009 and 1138 million at december 31 2008 

as reflected in schedule 24 the company’s nonperforming assets as a percentage of net loans and leases and oreo decreased substantially during 2010 the percentage was 491 at december 31 2010 compared with 679 on december 31 2009 and 271 on december 31 2008 

  

total nonaccrual loans excluding fdicsupported loans at december 31 2010 decreased by 530 million from december 31 2009 the decrease included 331 million for construction and land development loans 132 million for owner occupied loans and 95 million for commercial and industrial loans this positive impact was partially offset by a 36 million increase in commercial real estate term loans the decrease in nonaccrual loans occurred primarily at zions bank amegy and nba 

schedule 24 

nonperforming lendingrelated assets 

 

  

   

tdr loans 

nonaccrual loans also include nonperforming loans which have been restructured and classified as troubled debt restructured loans 

tdrs are loans which have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties and for which the company has granted a concession that it would not otherwise consider these modifications are structured on a loanbyloan basis and depending on the circumstances may include extended payment terms a modified interest rate forgiveness of principal on occasion or other concessions however not all modifications are tdrs modifications are also performed in the normal course of business for borrowers that are not experiencing financial difficulty wherein we meet the customer’s specific needs comply with contractual commitments as well as for competitive reasons 

we consider many factors in determining whether to agree to a loan modification involving concessions and seek a solution that will both minimize potential loss to the company and attempt to help the borrower we evaluate the borrower’s current and forecasted future cash flows their ability and willingness to make current contractual or proposed modified payments the value of the underlying collateral if applicable the possibility of obtaining additional security and the potential costs related to a repossession or foreclosure and the subsequent sale of the collateral 

tdrs are classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans if a nonaccrual loan is restructured as a tdr it will remain on nonaccrual status until the borrower has proven the ability to perform under the modified structure for a minimum of six months and there is evidence that such payments can and are likely to continue as agreed most often loans are classified as nonaccrual according to our nonaccrual policy when restructured as a tdr 

schedule 25 provides the outstanding balances of our tdr loans 

schedule 25 

accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans 

 

 commercial loan tdrs 

commercial loans commercial lending “ci” and commercial real estate “cre” may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project to achieve a higher leaseup percentage to sell the property or for other reasons when it is in the best interest of the company and the borrower to agree to a concession we modify the loan rather than to try to pursue collection through foreclosure or other means 

for certain troubled debt restructurings we split the loan into two new notes – a and b notes the a note is structured to comply with our current lending standards at current market rates and is tailored to suit the customer’s ability to make timely interest and principal payments the b note represents the concession granted to the borrower and varies by situation but usually we defer principal and interest payments until the a note has been paid in full the b note is often chargedoff soon after the restructuring has been completed and any payments collected are accounted for as recoveries 

at december 31 2010 the company had classified 159 million and 532 million of ci and cre loans as tdrs respectively 

  

consumer loan tdrs 

consumer loan tdrs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with a new loan from another lender or who is experiencing economic hardship such tdrs may include firstlien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans at december 31 2010 the company had classified 64 million of consumer loans as tdrs 

  

other 

in addition to the lending related nonperforming assets the company had 195 million in carrying value of investments in debt securities that were on nonaccrual status at december 31 2010 which compared to 171 million at december 31 2009 

allowance and reserve for credit losses 

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

schedule 26 summarizes the company’s loan loss experience by major portfolio segment 

schedule 26 

summary of loan loss experience 

 

   

schedule 27 provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation among the portfolio segments 

schedule 27 

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 

 

 the total allowance for loan losses at december 31 2010 decreased by 91 million from the level at yearend 2009 for 2010 the 148 million increase in the allowance for loan losses for commercial lending reflects deterioration of borrower credit quality due to difficult economic conditions reductions in collateral values and increases in realized loss rates that increased our quantitative loss factors for commercial real estate and consumer portfolios as well the 266 million decrease in the allowance for commercial real estate loans largely reflects the decrease in loans outstanding for the construction and land development portfolio and improving credit quality measures across the company 

the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the december 31 2010 balance decreased by 5 million from december 31 2009 this decrease is primarily due to an improvement in credit quality measures including a reduction of criticized and classified commitments see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses 

interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates on the company’s net interest income market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company the boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews limit exceptions reported by management the board has established the management alco to which it has delegated the functional management of interest rate and market risk for the company alco’s primary responsibilities include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have the net interest margin increase slightly in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being slightly “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise the company has positioned its december 31 2010 balance sheet to be more asset sensitive than it was at december 31 2009 

we attempt to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income primarily through the use of interest rate floors on variable rate loans interest rate swaps use of interest rate futures and by avoiding large exposures to longterm fixed rate interestearning assets that have significant negative convexity the prime lending rate and the libor curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

we monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods duration of equity and income simulation in the duration of equity method we measure the expected changes in the fair values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the income simulation method we analyze the expected changes in income in response to changes in interest rates 

duration of equity is derived by first calculating the dollar duration of all assets liabilities and derivative instruments dollar duration is determined by calculating the fair value of each instrument assuming interest rates sustain immediate and parallel movements up 1 and down 1 the average of these two changes in fair value is the dollar duration subtracting the dollar duration of liabilities from the dollar duration of assets and adding the net dollar duration of derivative instruments results in the dollar duration of equity duration of equity is computed by dividing the dollar duration of equity by the fair value of equity the company’s policy is generally to maintain duration of equity between 3 years to 7 years however in the current low interest rate environment the company is operating with a duration of equity of slightly less than 3 years in some scenarios 

income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income and total rate sensitive income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income and total rate sensitive income are measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio for income simulation company policy requires that interest sensitive income from a static balance sheet be limited to a decline of no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 basis points 

  

both of these measurement methods require that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of duration and income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is managed actively to try to maintain a slightly assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

we should note that estimated duration of equity and the income simulation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these estimates we view both the duration of equity and the income simulation results as falling within a wide range of possibilities 

as of the dates indicated schedule 28 shows the company’s estimated range of duration of equity and percentage change in interest sensitive income based on a static balance sheet in the first year after the rate change if interest rates were to sustain an immediate parallel change of 200 basis points the “fast” and “slow” results differ based on the assumed speed of repricing of administeredrate deposits money market interestonchecking and savings 

schedule 28 

duration of equity and interest sensitive income 

 

  

 during 2010 the duration of equity became shorter as compared to december 31 2009 primarily driven by an increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits a decline in loans and an increase in money market instruments noninterestbearing demand deposits increased to 308 of total liabilities at december 31 2010 compared to 271 at the end of 2009 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at the end of 2010 and 2009 approximately 77 and 78 respectively of the company’s commercial lending and commercial real estate portfolios were variable rate and primarily tied to either the prime rate or libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have variable interest rates 

  

the company had historically used interest rate swaps to convert most of its longterm fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt in 2009 these swaps were terminated when management decided to position the company to be more asset sensitive in light of historically low shortterm interest rates and unprecedented “quantitative easing” monetary policy actions by the federal reserve we have also traditionally engaged in an ongoing program of swapping primebased and liborbased loans for “receivefixed” contracts however during 2010 we terminated and did not replace a number of such swaps with the objective of positioning the company’s balance sheet to be more asset sensitive at yearend 2010 and 2009 the company held a notional amount of approximately 05 billion and 09 billion respectively of such cash flow hedge contracts these swaps also expose the company to counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk the company’s approach to managing this risk is discussed in “credit risk management” on page 62 the company retains basis risk due to changes between the prime rate and libor on nonhedge derivative basis swaps see “accounting for derivatives” on page 31 for further details about our derivative instruments finally the company’s subsidiary banks made increasing use of interest rate floors on new loans as of december 31 2010 approximately 484 of all of the company’s variable rate loan balances contain floors of the loans with floors approximately 755 of the balances are priced at the floor rates which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 122 on that date at the end of the previous year 263 of the company’s variable rate loans were priced at floors that were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 155 on that date 

in the latter half of 2010 the company began to mitigate the asset sensitivity of its balance sheet by purchasing a combination of eurodollar futures contracts and put options for some of these same contracts the eurodollar futures are intended to mitigate the potential impact that declining interest rates could have on the company’s future earnings while the purpose of the put options is to limit the exposure in an environment of rising interest rates also in the latter half of 2010 the company deployed some of its excess liquidity by purchasing floating rate agency mortgagebacked securities with the same objective of mitigating asset sensitivity

 market risk – fixed income 

the company engages in the underwriting and trading of municipal and corporate securities this trading activity exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities 

at december 31 2010 the company had 49 million of trading assets and 43 million of securities sold not yet purchased compared with 24 million and 43 million on december 31 2009 respectively 

the company is exposed to market risk through changes in fair value and otti of htm and afs securities the company also is exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps and eurodollar and federal funds futures contracts used to hedge interest rate risk changes in fair value of afs securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in oci each quarter during 2010 the aftertax change in oci attributable to htm and afs securities was 41 million and the change attributable to interest rate swaps was 374 million if any of the afs or htm securities transferred from afs become other than temporarily impaired any credit loss in oci is reversed and the impairment is charged to operations see “investment securities portfolio” on page 52 for additional information on otti 

market risk – equity investments 

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded and subject to fluctuations in their market prices or values in addition the company owns equity securities in 

  

companies that are not publicly traded that are accounted for under cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs in either case the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since the fair value of these securities may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss these equity investments are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

the company also invests in prepublic venture capital companies through various venture funds the company’s remaining equity exposure to these investments net of related noncontrolling interests at december 31 2010 was approximately 48 million compared to approximately 56 million at december 31 2009 

in addition to the program described above amegy has in place an alternative investments program these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds generally are not part of the strategy since the underlying companies are typically not creditworthy the carrying value of the investments was 68 million and 63 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively at december 31 2010 and 2009 the company has a total remaining funding commitment of 56 million and 78 million respectively to sbic nonsbic funds and private equity investments of these commitments approximately 41 million and 53 million respectively were at amegy 

under the provisions of the doddfrank act the company is allowed to fund remaining unfunded portions of existing private equity fund commitments but is not allowed to make any additional commitments to invest in private equity funds 

liquidity risk 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary bank levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines for example the ‘time to required funding’ and fixed charges coverage ratios that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and bank subsidiaries as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for parent and bank liquidity 

the management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally by zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the policy guidelines these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and potentially to the company’s board of directors the subsidiary banks have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and the federal reserve and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank andor correspondent banks the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer but are not involved in any other funding decision making processes 

  

contractual obligations 

schedule 30 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2010 

schedule 30 

contractual obligations 

 

  

   in addition to the commitments specifically noted in the previous schedule the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive cash or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change for further information on derivative contracts see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity management actions 

consolidated cash and interestbearing deposits at the parent and its subsidiaries increased to 55 billion at december 31 2010 from 20 billion at december 31 2009 during 2010 we had a significant increase in cash mainly due to our capital raising transactions and a net decrease in loans partially offset by a decrease in total deposits 

parent company liquidity the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common 

  

shareholders including the cpp preferred equity issued to the us department of the treasury the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes equity contributed through the exercise of stock options and longterm debt and equity issuances 

during 2010 the parent did not receive dividends on common or preferred stock from its banking subsidiaries the amount of dividends the banking subsidiaries can pay to the parent are restricted by current and historical earnings levels retained earnings riskbased capital requirements and other regulatory capital requirements several of the company’s subsidiary banks returned to profitability over the course of 2010 and most are expected to be profitable in 2011 this may permit the payment of some dividends by the banks to the parent or a return of some capital to the parent in 2011 however if the operating performance of the subsidiary banks deteriorates under renewed weak economic conditions or changes in regulation or law in 2011 the banks may not be able to pay dividends to the parent see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of dividend capacities and limitations 

also earnings on the parent’s investment securities portfolio have been reduced therefore cash receipts from subsidiaries and investments currently do not cover the parent’s interest and dividend payments and may not cover these payments in 2011 in addition the parent had to increase its investment in several of its bank subsidiaries in 2009 and in the first quarter of 2010 in order to maintain capital levels appropriate to current weak economic and credit quality conditions the company does not anticipate any need to make further capital investments in its bank subsidiaries in 2011 the company has reduced the dividend on its common stock to 001 per share per quarter due to lack of earnings and in order to conserve both capital and cash 

federal reserve board supervisory letter sr 094 dated february 24 2009 as revised march 27 2009 reiterates and expands previous guidance to bank holding companies regarding the payment of common dividends preferred dividends and dividends on more senior capital instruments in times of stress on earnings and capital ratios on november 17 2010 the federal reserve board issued a revised temporary addendum to this letter stating that bank holding companies should consult with the federal reserve staff before taking any capital actions including actions that could result in a diminished capital base such as increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments 

general financial market and economic conditions both of which have been highly stressed since mid2008 or earlier as well as the company’s debt ratings have adversely impacted the company’s access to external financing access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is directly impacted by the credit ratings they receive from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings one rating agency moody’s rates the company’s senior debt as b2 or noninvestment grade while standard  poor’s fitch and dbrs all rate the company’s senior debt at a low investment grade level in addition all four rating agencies rate the company’s subordinated debt as noninvestment grade in august 2010 moody’s changed its outlook for the company to positive from negative while in december 2010 fitch downgraded the company’s senior debt rating one “notch” to bbb but changed its outlook from negative to stable the other two agencies have a negative outlook for the company 

  

the parent had the following ratings as of december 31 2010 

schedule 31 

credit ratings 

 

 during 2010 the primary sources of additional cash to the parent in the capital markets were 1 623 million from the issuance of new shares of common stock 2 139 million from the issuance of new shares of series e preferred stock 3 215 million from the issuance of common stock warrants 4 267 million from the issuance of unsecured 1025 year senior notes and 5 40 million from the issuance of fiveyear 775 unsecured senior notes in total these sources added approximately 1284 million to the parent’s liquid assets the parent had a cash balance of 500 million and 700 million of us treasury bills at december 31 2010 compared to a cash balance of 542 million and no highly liquid securities at december 31 2009 

during 2010 and 2009 the parent’s operating expenses included cash payments for interest of approximately 147 million and 123 million respectively additionally the parent paid 1093 million and 963 million of dividends on preferred and common stock respectively for the same applicable periods note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 

during 2010 issuances by the parent of longterm debt exceeded repayments cash received from the issuance of longterm debt during 2010 included 40 million from the issuance of additional 775 unsecured notes due september 23 2014 and 106 million from the issuance of senior mediumterm notes due between october 2012 and february 2013 

shortterm borrowings by the parent exceeded repayments which resulted in 113 million of cash inflows during 2010 during 2010 the company issued 161 million of oneyear senior mediumterm notes 

at december 31 2010 maturities of the company’s senior and subordinated debt ranged from august 2011 to november 2015 with effective interest rates from 066 to 775

subsidiary bank liquidity the subsidiaries’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2010 these core deposits excluding brokered deposits in aggregate constituted 935 of consolidated deposits compared with 893 of consolidated deposits at december 31 2009 on a consolidated basis the company’s net loan to total deposit ratio is historically low at 898 another measure of strong bank liquidity 

historically the company’s subsidiary banks have also obtained brokered deposits to serve as an additional source of liquidity which is currently not needed given the strong levels of affiliate liquidity the company has 

  

aggressively lowered its brokered deposit usage during 2010 total brokered deposits declined 12 billion to only 04 billion at yearend 2010 down from 16 billion at december 31 2009 brokered deposits are currently 11 of total deposits 

total deposits decreased by 906 million during 2010 due to our efforts to reduce excess liquidity which primarily resulted in decreases in time and money market deposits partially offset by increases in noninterestbearing demand and savings and now deposits we also worked with a number of business and governmental customers to help them move excess cash balances into sweep accounts at thirdparty money market funds which prevented the growth in demand balances from being even larger we will continue to reduce noncore and nonrelationship deposits to improve profitability and return on capital as loans continue to runoff but as loan demand improves we anticipate bringing these deposits back onto the balance sheet 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act made permanent the maximum deposit insurance amount of 250000 on november 9 2010 the fdic issued a final rule providing temporary unlimited insurance coverage for noninterestbearing transaction accounts at all fdicinsured depository institutions effective december 31 2010 through december 31 2012 

the fhlb system has from time to time been a significant source of liquidity for each of the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank and tcbw are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nba are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy bank is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity requirements borrowings from the fhlb may increase in the future depending on availability of funding from other sources such as deposits the subsidiary banks are required to invest in fhlb stock to maintain their borrowing capacity at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 the company had 20 million and 16 million respectively of longterm borrowings outstanding from the fhlb but did not have any shortterm borrowings outstanding from the fhlb for the same applicable periods at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 the subsidiary banks’ total investment in fhlb stock was approximately 125 million and 136 million respectively 

at december 31 2010 the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 125 billion as of yearend 2010 these sources of liquidity would be able to fund all unfunded commercial and consumer loan commitments 

zions bank has in prior years used asset securitizations to sell loans and to provide a flexible alternative source of funding as a qspe securities conduit sponsored by zions bank lockhart funding purchased and held creditenhanced securitized assets resulting from certain small business loan securitizations during 2009 zions bank purchased 678 million of securities from lockhart at book value under the terms of a liquidity facility zions bank provided to lockhart during the second quarter of 2009 lockhart was consolidated onto the books of zions bank as a result of zions bank holding over 90 of lockhart’s asset backed commercial paper and in september 2009 lockhart was terminated see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about lockhart and the liquidity agreement 

while not considered a primary source of funding the company’s investment activities can provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture that is being taken for 2010 investment securities activities resulted in an increase in investment securities holdings and a net decrease of cash in the amount of 565 million primarily due to the purchase of approximately 700 million of 39 month us treasury bills with excess cash in the fourth quarter of 2010 

during 2010 several of the company’s subsidiary banks surrendered certain bankowned life insurance contracts and received cash of 211 million for the settlement of the cash surrender values of the policies 

maturing balances in our subsidiary banks’ loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows during 2010 and 2009 organic loan activity resulted in a net cash inflow of 18 billion and 14 billion respectively as a result of paydowns and decreased loan demand 

  

during 2010 the company received net cash income tax refunds of 325 million the majority of which was for the benefit of our subsidiary banks and the remainder for the benefit of the parent 

operational risk management 

operational risk is the potential for unexpected losses attributable to human error systems failures fraud or inadequate internal controls and procedures in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has created a corporate risk management department whose responsibility is to help company management identify and assess key risks and monitor the key internal controls and processes that the company has in place to mitigate operational risk we have documented controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

to manage and minimize its operating risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments in addition reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we maintain contingency plans and systems for operations support in the event of natural or other disasters efforts are continually underway to improve the company’s oversight of operational risk including enhancement of riskcontrol self assessment and antifraud measures reporting to the enterprise risk management committee and the board we also mitigate operational risks through the purchase of insurance including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance 

capital management 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the cmc whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary banks other major cmc responsibilities include 

 

  

 the cmc in managing the capital of the company may set capital standards that are higher than those approved by the board but may not set lower limits 

the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

 

  

  

  

   

in addition the cmc oversees the company’s capital “stress testing” under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios 

the company’s debt and equity issuances during 2010 along with the trs originated in 2010 with regard to certain of the company’s cdo investments have significantly bolstered the company’s capital position and ratios however the company anticipates that it may continue to raise additional common equity in amounts sufficient to cover losses and dividends until it returns to profitability in order to preserve this capital position 

total controlling interest shareholders’ equity at december 31 2010 was 6648 million compared to 5693 million at december 31 2009 an increase of 168 the increase in total controlling interest shareholders’ equity from december 31 2009 is primarily due to the previously discussed capital actions partially offset by a net loss for 2010 and dividends paid on common and preferred stock for the same applicable period 

note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information on riskbased capital in addition “liquidity risk” on page 79 and notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements discuss the company’s debt and equity transactions during 2010 

conversions of convertible subordinated debt into preferred stock have augmented the company’s capital position and reduced future refinancing needs from the original modification in june 2009 through december 2010 406 million of debt has been extinguished and 474 million of preferred capital has been added schedule 32 shows the effect the conversions had on tier 1 capital and outstanding convertible subordinated debt 

  

  

schedule 32 

impact of convertible subordinated debt 

 

 the company’s various issuances of new common stock and warrants to purchase common stock added 838 million of common equity in 2010 which far more than offset the 205 million decrease in common equity resulting from subordinated debt conversions 

on february 15 2011 the company filed a form 8k disclosing that holders of subordinated notes elected to convert a combined 858 million principal amount of these notes into the company’s preferred stock the company expects that an additional 85829 shares of series c and 20 shares of series a preferred stock will be 

  

issued on march 15 2011 unless the elections are revoked prior to that date also 146 million of the original beneficial conversion feature will be reclassified into preferred stock from common stock as a result of this conversion the expected accelerated discount amortization attributable to the conversions was approximately 410 million in the first quarter of 2011 and 733 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 

the company paid 67 million in dividends on common stock in 2010 the board of directors declared a dividend of 001 per common share payable on february 28 2011 to shareholders of record on february 22 2011 this is unchanged from the rate paid since the third quarter of 2009 under the terms of the cpp the company may not increase the dividend on its common stock above 032 per share per quarter during the period the senior preferred shares are outstanding without adversely impacting the company’s interest in the program or without permission from the us department of the treasury 

the company recorded preferred stock dividends of 1229 million and 1030 million during 2010 and 2009 respectively preferred dividends for 2010 and 2009 include 902 million and 886 million respectively related to the tarp preferred stock issued to the us department of the treasury consisting of cash payments of 700 million in both 2010 and 2009 and accretion of 202 million and 186 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively for the difference between the fair value and par amount of the tarp preferred stock when issued 

banking organizations are required under published regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios the company’s capital ratios were as follows 

schedule 33 

capital ratios 

 

 the company expects that it and the banking industry as a whole will be required by market forces andor regulation including new standards promulgated in december 2010 by the basel committee on banking supervision to operate with higher capital ratios than in the recent past in addition the cpp capital preferred dividend is scheduled to increase from 5 to 9 in 2013 making it more expensive as a source of capital if not redeemed at or prior to that time thus in addition to maintaining higher levels of capital the company’s capital structure may continue to be subject to greater variation over the next few years than has been true historically due to the still highly uncertain economic and regulatory environments therefore in 2011 continuing to preserve and augment capital in response to these uncertainties and in preparation for the eventual repayment of tarp cpp preferred stock are likely to take precedence over making capital investments to expand the business or returning capital to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases 

at december 31 2010 regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital were 6350 million and 7364 million compared to 5407 million and 6823 million at december 31 2009 

  

gaap to nongaap reconciliation 

1 tier 1 common equity 

traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulators have assessed a bank’s capital adequacy based on tier 1 capital the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations regulators have begun supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier 1 capital known as tier 1 common equity the tier 1 common equity ratio is the core capital component of the basel iii standards and we believe that it increasingly is becoming a key ratio considered by both regulators and investors because tier 1 common equity is not formally defined by gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure and other entities may calculate them differently than zions’ disclosed calculations since investors and banking regulators may assess zions’ capital adequacy using tier 1 common equity zions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess zions’ capital adequacy on this same basis 

tier 1 common equity is often expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets under the riskbased capital framework a bank’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of offbalance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad “basel i” risk categories for banks like our banking subsidiaries that have not adopted the basel ii “advanced measurement approach” the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the riskweighted assets total that as adjusted comprises the denominator of certain riskbased capital ratios tier 1 capital is then divided by this denominator riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 capital ratio adjustments are made to tier 1 capital to arrive at tier 1 common equity tier 1 common equity is also divided by the riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 common equity ratio the amounts disclosed as riskweighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements

competition 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks thrifts and credit unions including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies financial technology firms and a variety of other types of companies many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include pricing convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered and the level of service delivered the company must compete effectively along all of these parameters to remain successful 

  

supervision and regulation 

the parent is a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company as provided by the grammleachbliley act of 1999 “the glb act” the bhc act and other federal statutes as modified by the glb act provide the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the federal reserve board the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company the parent must satisfy certain ongoing criteria the company currently engages in only limited activities for which financial holding company status is required 

the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or other statutes governing national banks and the banking laws of their various states as well as the rules and regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the frb and the fdic they are also under the supervision of and are continually subject to periodic examination by the occ or their respective state banking departments the frb and the fdic many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the securities and exchange commission “sec” financial industry regulatory authority “finra” andor state securities regulators our nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states in which they conduct business 

the company is subject to various requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

 the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is 

  

a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply the bcbs has been working for a number of years on revisions to basel i in december 2007 us banking regulators published the final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” 

modifications to the basel ii regime “basel iii” continue to be proposed additionally regulators may subjectively require banking organizations to maintain capital reserves or liquidity at levels higher than those codified by regulation or those prior to the recent economic crisis adoption of new basel iii requirements andor regulatory actions may have a significant impact on bank capital and liquidity levels going forward 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company listed on the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which addresses among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a comprehensive system of corporate governance practices this system includes corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct and charters for the audit credit review compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

regulators congress state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

  

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect both shortterm and longterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit the tools available to the frb which may be used to implement monetary policy include 

 

  

  

  

  

 these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the company including but not limited to 

the company has been and could continue to be negatively affected by recent adverse economic conditions 

the united states and many other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession which has not yet been resolved these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected and are likely to continue for some time to adversely affect the company’s assets including its loans and securities portfolios capital levels results of operations and financial condition in response to the economic crisis the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis these programs and policies appear to have stabilized the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of 2008 but the extent to which these programs and policies will assist in an economic recovery or may lead to adverse consequences whether anticipated or unanticipated is still unclear if these programs and policies are ineffective in bringing about an economic recovery or result in substantial adverse developments the economic conditions may again become more severe or adverse economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions or delay in the recovery from them would adversely affect the company 

our participation in the cpp and other government programs imposes restrictions and obligations on us that limit our ability to increase dividends repurchase shares of our stock and access the equity capital markets 

the company has chosen to participate in a number of new programs sponsored by the us government during the current financial and economic crisis these programs including without limitation the tarp and its associated cpp as well as the arra and eesa and regulations thereunder contain important limitations on the company’s conduct of its business including limitations on dividends repurchases of common stock acquisitions and executive compensation these limitations may adversely impact the company’s ability to attract nongovernmental capital and to recruit and retain executive management and other personnel and its ability to compete with other american and foreign financial institutions one of these programs the cpp contains provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally modify any term or provision of contracts executed under the program 

legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations 

in response to the recent economic crisis various legislative proposals that would materially restructure the regulatory framework governing the financial services industry have been introduced or are being considered for introduction in congress these proposals include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 also in response to the recent economic crisis bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or appear to be considering new regulations and requirements some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation these include but are not limited to 

 

   

  

  

  

 some of these proposals could adversely affect the company by among other things impacting after tax returns earned by financial services firms in general limiting the company’s ability to grow increasing taxes or fees on some of the company’s funding or activities limiting the range of products and services that the company could offer exposing the company to costly litigation and regulatory actions and increasing the cost of regulatory compliance requiring the company to raise capital at inopportune times and making it difficult for the company to compete with other banking and nonbanking companies to recruit and retain executives and other employees others of these proposals may actually favorably impact the company by affecting some of its competitors more adversely than the company the ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which if any may eventually be enacted into law or regulation 

economic and other circumstances including pressure to repay tarp preferred stock may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the company 

the company’s subsidiary banks must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by their banking regulators and which can change depending upon general economic conditions and their particular condition risk profile and growth plans compliance with capital requirements may limit the company’s ability to expand and has required and may require capital investment from the parent in 2008 we issued shares of preferred stock for 14 billion and a warrant to purchase shares of the company’s common stock to the us treasury under tarp there may be increasing market regulatory or political pressure on the company to raise capital to enable it to repay the preferred stock issued to the us treasury under tarp at a time or in amounts that may be unfavorable to the company’s shareholders these uncertainties and risks created by the legislative and regulatory uncertainties discussed above may themselves increase the company’s cost of capital and other financing costs 

negative perceptions associated with our continued participation in the us treasury’s tarp may adversely affect our ability to retain customers attract investors and compete for new business opportunities 

several financial institutions which also participated in the cpp have repurchased their tarp preferred stock there can be no assurance as to the timing or manner in which the company may repurchase its tarp preferred stock from the us treasury our customers employees and counterparties in our current and future business relationships could draw negative implications regarding the strength of the company as a financial institution based on our continued participation in the tarp following the exit of one or more of our competitors or other financial institutions any such negative perceptions could impair our ability to effectively compete with other financial institutions for business or to retain high performing employees if this were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected perhaps materially 

credit quality has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

credit risk is one of our most significant risks the company’s level of credit quality continued to weaken during 2009 in most loan types and markets in which the company operates we expect continued credit quality weakness over the next few quarters 

failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us 

net interest income is the largest component of the company’s revenue the management of interest rate risk for the company and all bank subsidiaries is centralized and overseen by an asset liability management committee appointed by the company’s board of directors the company has been successful in its interest rate 

  

risk management as evidenced by achieving a relatively stable net interest margin over the last several years when interest rates have been volatile and the rate environment challenging factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the company’s risk these factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources and volatile market interest rates subject to general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb 

our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity has been and may continue to be adversely affected by market conditions 

funding availability as opposed to funding cost remained a more important risk factor during 2009 as a global liquidity crisis continued to affect financial institutions generally including the company however the company was able to take a number of actions during the year to augment its capital and liquidity see “capital management” on page 126 in mda and notes 11 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on funding availability it is expected that liquidity stresses will continue to be a risk factor in 2010 for the company the parent and its affiliate banks 

the quality and liquidity of our assetbacked securities investment portfolio has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us 

the company’s assetbacked securities investment portfolio includes collateralized debt obligations “cdos” collateralized by trust preferred securities issued by banks insurance companies and real estate investment trusts “reits” that may have some exposure to construction loan commercial real estate and the subprime markets andor to other categories of distressed assets in addition assetbacked securities also include structured assetbacked collateralized debt obligations “abs cdos” also known as diversified structured finance cdos which have minimal exposure to subprime and home equity mortgage securitizations factors beyond the company’s control can significantly influence the fair value and impairment status of these securities these factors include but are not limited to defaults and deferrals by debt issuers rating agency downgrades of securities lack of market pricing of securities or the return of market pricing that varies from the company’s current model valuations rating agency downgrades of monoline insurers that insure certain assetbacked securities continued instability in the credit markets and changes in prepayment rates and future interest rates see “investment securities portfolio” on page 91 for further details 

we have been unprofitable and may continue to be unprofitable and such lack of profitability could have particular adverse effects on us such as restricting our ability to pay dividends or requiring a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 

the parent and certain of its subsidiary banks have been unprofitable in each of the most recent five quarters the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends is restricted by regulatory requirements including profitability and the need to maintain required levels of capital continuing lack of profitability exposes the company to the risk that regulators could restrict the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent andor of the parent to declare and pay dividends on its common stock preferred stock or trust preferred securities it also increases the risk that the company may have to establish a “valuation allowance” against its net deferred tax asset “dta” the parent and some of its subsidiary banks already have some disallowed dta for regulatory capital purposes 

we andor the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 

our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us certain of our affiliates and particular classes of securities that we and our affiliates issue the interest rates we pay on our securities are also influenced by among other things the credit ratings that we our affiliates andor our securities receive from recognized rating agencies the rating agencies have in the past downgraded our ratings further downgrades could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on the market price of our securities our ability to access capital markets or our results of operations or financial condition 

  

we could be adversely affected by accounting financial reporting and regulatory and compliance risk 

the company is exposed to accounting financial reporting and regulatorycompliance risk the company provides to its customers and uses for its own capital funding and risk management needs a number of complex financial products and services estimates judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services identification interpretation and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements therefore pose an ongoing risk 

we could be adversely affected by litigation and legal claims 

the company is subject to risks associated with legal claims and litigation the company’s exposure to claims and litigation has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers counterparties and others arising from the current economic crisis or otherwise 

we could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls 

a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations 

we could be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions 

from time to time the company makes acquisitions including the acquisition of assets and liabilities of failed banks from the fdic acting as a receiver the fdicsupported transactions are subject to loan loss sharing agreements failure to comply with the terms of the agreements could result in the loss of indemnification from the fdic the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the projected cost savings from the acquisition and on the continued growth and profitability of the acquisition target we have been successful with most prior acquisitions but it is possible that the merger integration process with an acquisition target could result in the loss of key employees disruptions in controls procedures and policies or other factors that could affect our ability to realize the projected savings and successfully retain and grow the target’s customer base 

the company’s board of directors has established an enterprise risk management policy and has appointed an enterprise risk management committee to oversee and implement the policy in addition to credit and interest rate risk the committee also monitors the following risk areas market risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk information technology risk strategic risk compensationrelated risk and reputation risk

executive summary 

company overview 

zions bancorporation “the parent” and subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 51 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah as of september 30 2009 the company was the 17 th largest domestic bank holding company in terms of deposits at december 31 2009 the company operated banking businesses through 491 domestic branches and 602 atms in ten western and southwestern states arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah and washington our banking businesses include zions first national bank “zions bank” in utah and idaho california bank  trust “cbt” amegy corporation “amegy” and its subsidiary amegy bank in texas national bank of arizona “nba” nevada state bank “nsb” vectra bank colorado “vectra” in colorado and new mexico the commerce bank of washington “tcbw” and the commerce bank of oregon “tcbo” 

the company also operates several specialty financial services and financial technology businesses that conduct business on a regional or national scale the company is a national leader in small business administration “sba” lending public finance advisory services and software sales and cash management services related to “check 21 act” electronic imaging and clearing of checks in addition zions is included in the standard and poor’s 500 “sp 500” and nasdaq financial 100 indices 

in operating its banking businesses the company seeks to combine the front office or customer facing advantages that it believes can result from decentralized organization and branding with those that can come from centralized risk management capital management and operations in its specialty financial services and technology businesses the company seeks to develop a competitive advantage in a particular product customer or technology niche 

  

distribution of loans and deposits 

as shown in charts 1 and 2 the company’s loans and core deposits are widely diversified among the banking franchises the company operates 

note core deposits are defined as total deposits excluding 

brokered deposits and time deposits 100000 and over 

  

the company’s loan portfolio also is diversified as to type of loan however as shown in chart 3 it does have a significant concentration of exposure to commercial real estate including residential land acquisition and development lending in arizona nevada and to a lesser degree california and the intermountain west that have been under severe stress due to the ongoing declines in housingrelated prices and in residential building 

business strategies 

we believe that the company distinguishes itself by having a longterm strategy for growth in its banking businesses that is unique for a bank holding company of its size this growth strategy is driven by four key factors 1 focus on high growth markets 2 keep decisions that affect customers local 3 centralize technology and operations to achieve economies of scale and 4 centralize and standardize policies and management controlling key risks these strategies are more fully set forth as follows 

focus on high growth markets 

each of the states in which the company conducts its banking businesses has experienced relatively high levels of historical economic growth and each ranks among the top onethird of states as ranked by population and household income growth projected by the us census bureau despite weaker employment and economic growth in some of these markets in 2009 which may persist through much of 2010 the company believes that over the medium to longer term all of these markets will continue to be among the fastest growing in the country 

  

schedule 1 

demographic profile 

by state 

 

  

  the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in these banking markets within each of the states where the company operates we focus on the market segments that we believe present the best opportunities for us we believe that these states over time have experienced higher rates of growth business formation and expansion than other states we also believe that over the long term these states will continue to experience higher rates of commercial real estate development as businesses provide housing shopping business facilities and other amenities for their growing populations however in the near term growth in many of our geographies and market segments has slowed markedly due to weakening economic conditions and loan demand we have recently experienced net portfolio shrinkage in distressed real estate markets in the southwest 

a common focus of all of zions’ subsidiary banks is small and middle market business banking including the personal banking needs of the executives and employees of those businesses and commercial real estate development in addition to our commercial business we also provide a broad base of consumer financial products in selected markets including home mortgages home equity credit lines auto loans and credit cards this mix of business often leads to loan balances growing faster than internally generated deposits this was particularly true in much of 2008 as loan growth significantly outpaced low cost core deposit growth in addition it has important implications for the company’s management of certain risks including interest rate and liquidity risks which are discussed further in later sections of this document 

keep decisions that affect customers local 

the company operates eight different communityregional banks each under a different name and each with its own charter chief executive officer and management team this structure helps to ensure that decisions related to customers are made at a local level in addition each bank controls among other things most decisions related to its branding market strategies customer relationships product pricing and credit decisions within the limits of established corporate policy in this way we are able to differentiate our banks from much larger “mass market” banking competitors that operate regional or national franchises under a common brand and often around “vertical” product silos we believe that this approach allows us to attract and retain exceptional 

  

management and that it also results in providing service of the highest quality to our targeted customers in addition we believe that over time this strategy generates superior growth in our banking businesses 

centralize technology and operations to achieve economies of scale 

we seek to differentiate the company from smaller banks in two ways first we use the combined scale of all of the banking operations to create a broad product offering without the fragmentation of systems and operations that would typically drive up costs second for certain products for which economies of scale are believed to be important the company “manufactures” the product centrally or outsources it from a third party examples include cash management credit card administration mortgage servicing and deposit operations in this way the company seeks to create and maintain efficiencies while generating superior growth 

centralize and standardize policies and management controlling key risks 

we seek to standardize policies and practices related to the management of key risks in order to assure a consistent risk profile in an otherwise decentralized management model among these key risks and functions are credit interest rate liquidity and market risks although credit decisions are made locally within each affiliate bank these decisions are made within the framework of a corporate credit policy that is standard among all of our affiliate banks each bank may amend the policy in a more conservative direction however it may not amend the policy in a more liberal direction in that case it must request a specific waiver from the company’s chief credit officer in practice only a limited number of waivers have been granted similarly the credit examination function is a corporate activity reporting to the credit review committee of the board of directors and administratively reporting to the director of enterprise risk management who reports to the company’s ceo this assures a reasonable consistency of loan quality grading and loan loss reserving practices among all affiliate banks 

interest rate risk management liquidity and market risk and portfolio investments also are managed centrally by a boarddesignated asset liability management committee pursuant to corporate policies regarding interest rate risk liquidity investments and derivatives 

internal audit also is a centralized corporate function reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors and administratively reporting to the director of enterprise risk management who reports to the company’s ceo 

finally the board established an enterprise risk management committee in late 2005 which is supported by the director of enterprise risk management this committee seeks to monitor and mitigate as appropriate these and other key operating and strategic risks throughout the company 

while these longterm strategies have not changed the severe economic recession that unfolded in 2009 following the financial crises of 20072008 meant that of necessity much of management’s focus in 2009 was on guiding the company successfully through these severely adverse conditions as described further below 

management’s overview of 2009 performance 

the financial crisis and economic recession that became severe in the fall of 2008 with the collapse of lehman brothers and the de facto government takeovers of fannie mae freddie mac and american international group inc continued and deepened in 2009 capital and financing markets for banks were effectively limited in the last third of 2008 and access remained limited through the first quarter of 2009 

as this crisis unfolded and became more severe the federal reserve board “frb” and later the us treasury took a series of increasingly strong and less conventional actions to try to mitigate the crisis starting in mid2007 the frb aggressively lowered short term interest rates after a brief pause in mid2008 this aggressive reduction resumed and left the target fed funds rate at an alltime low of 0025 at yearend 2008 through 2009 in 2008 the frb introduced a number of programs to directly provide greater liquidity to a financial 

  

system under severe stress in 2009 the frb added additional programs to stabilize and provide liquidity to financial markets it was particularly active in directly purchasing over 1 trillion of mortgagebacked securities at the same time however other temporary supports put into place began to be withdrawn in the latter half of 2009 in the first half of 2009 the government required nineteen of the largest financial institutions to undergo a governmentdirected “stress test” to determine whether they had sufficient capital to withstand severe losses after this test several of these institutions repaid the capital purchase program preferred stock investment made in 2008 by the us treasury after raising significant amounts of capital this had the effect of reopening to some extent the capital markets to financial institutions the company took advantage of these slowly improving market conditions to raise various forms of capital and term financing at various times throughout the remainder of 2009 

the increased level of fdic deposit insurance to 250000 first established in october 2008 remains in effect in addition the fdic’s program to provide full deposit insurance coverage for noninterestbearing transaction deposit accounts was extended through june 30 2010 unless insured banks elect to opt out of the program the company did not opt out of this program 

the crisis and ensuing severe economic recession adversely impacted the company’s performance and management focused a great deal of attention on managing the impact of the crisis key impacts included among other things restricted access to capital and funding markets higher cost of capital and funding investor and regulatory pressure to maintain strong capital levels deteriorating credit quality which resulted in rising levels of loan losses and provision for loan losses deteriorating values and other than temporary impairment charges related to the company’s investment securities portfolio and impairment of goodwill related to the acquisition of amegy bank in 2005 

collectively these factors had a significant adverse impact on the company’s performance the company reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2009 of 12344 million or 992 per diluted common share as compared to a net loss of 2907 million or 268 per diluted common share for 2008 this compares with net earnings applicable to common shareholders of 4794 million or 440 per diluted share for 2007 return on average common equity was 2835 and return on average assets was 225 in 2009 compared with 569 and 050 in 2008 and 957 and 101 in 2007 

  

the key drivers of the company’s performance during 2009 were as follows 

schedule 2 

key drivers of performance 

2009 compared to 2008 

 

  

bp – basis points 

 excludes the impact of tarp preferred stock 

the company’s performance in 2009 compared to 2008 reflected the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 loan and deposit growth 

from 2005 through 2008 the company experienced steady and strong loan growth and moderate deposit growth augmented in 2005 and 2006 by the amegy acquisition in 2007 by the stockmen’s acquisition and in 2008 by the silver state acquisition deposits only from 2004 through 2006 we consider this performance to be primarily a result of strong economic conditions throughout most of our geographical footprint and of effectively executing our operating strategies the continued strong organic loan growth in the latter half of 2007 may also have begun to reflect the increasing lack of nonbank sources of credit as global credit market conditions deteriorated sharply chart 4 depicts this growth 

after strong growth in the first half of 2008 loan growth slowed sharply in the latter half and continued to slow throughout 2009 loan demand weakened throughout 2009 in all geographic markets that the company serves and in most core loan types as a result of sharply curtailed real estate activities and the national recession the net shrinkage in the commercial construction and land development 196 billion or 261 and commercial and industrial 153 billion or 133 loan categories was particularly noteworthy in addition to weak loan demand significant loan chargeoffs contributed to these declines particularly in the construction and land development category the company experienced significant organic net growth only in the commercial real estate term loan category which grew by 11 billion or 171 this growth reflected both new originations as well as the completion of creditworthy construction projects that “rolled” into term loans the company also acquired loans in three transactions with the fdic related to failed banks alliance and vineyard banks in california and great basin bank in nevada these loans totaled 14 billion at yearend 2009 compared to zero at the end of 2008 however these sources of growth were not sufficient to offset declines in other categories and the company’s loan portfolio shrank 15 billion or 35 excluding fdicsupported loans the shrinkage was 29 billion or 70 for the full year 2009 

while total deposits were relatively unchanged core deposit growth in 2009 was strong which enabled the company to pay down more expensive sources of funding including wholesale borrowings from federal home loan banks and time deposits and to reduce interest expense significantly growth was particularly strong in noninterestbearing transaction accounts 264 billion or 273 and savings and now accounts 139 billion or 312 the company believes that both the unlimited deposit insurance coverage of noninterestbearing 

  

transaction accounts and the very low shortterm interest rate levels resulting from federal reserve policy as well as the company’s own sales efforts contributed to this growth the fdicassisted acquisitions discussed above contributed relatively less to deposit growth than to loan totals as a large portion of their total funding was from highcost certificates of deposits brokered deposits and other expensive deposits a large portion of these deposits left the company by design when rates on such accounts were reset to lower levels 

credit quality 

the ratio of nonperforming lendingrelated assets excluding fdicsupported assets to net loans and other real estate owned “oreo” increased to 600 at yearend compared to 271 at the end of 2008 see chart 5 net loan chargeoffs for 2009 were 11726 million or 290 of average loans excluding fdicsupported loans compared to 3937 million or 096 of average loans for 2008 chart 7 highlights net chargeoffs by loan category the provision for loan losses increased significantly during 2009 to 20169 million compared to 6483 million for 2008 while the company’s ratio of net chargeoffs to average loans and leases excluding fdicsupported loans is now higher than the peer median see chart 6 its ratio of nonperforming assets to net loans and oreo excluding fdicsupported assets is now below the peer median see chart 5 

these trends reflect the impact of varying degrees of deteriorating credit quality in most of the company’s loan types and geographic regions as a result of the national recession the rate of deterioration was most severe in the first half of the year and showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 net chargeoffs came predominantly from the commercial real estate portfolio see chart 7 mainly construction and land development as a result of the economic recession’s continued adverse impact on credit quality the company continued to strengthen its allowance for credit losses which stood at 425 at yearend 2009 see chart 8

interest rate risk 

our focus in managing interest rate risk traditionally has been to not take positions based upon management’s forecasts of interest rates but rather to maintain a position of slight “assetsensitivity” however in 2009 in response to short term interest rates that were at or near zero and term interest rates at historic lows the company has positioned its balance sheet to be more asset sensitive than its historical position it has chosen not to take certain actions commonly used in the industry to increase duration and reduce asset sensitivity such as using excess liquidity to buy longer term securities this means that our assets primarily loans tend to reprice slightly more quickly than our liabilities primarily deposits the company historically has made extensive use of interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk in order to seek to achieve this desired position this practice has enabled us to achieve a relatively stable net interest margin during periods of volatile interest rates which is depicted in chart 9 

market levels of interest rates remained at historically low and relatively unchanged levels throughout 2009 therefore changes in loan and deposit pricing and in the composition of earning assets and funding were more significant drivers of the net interest income and margin than the company’s hedging strategies the company pushed spreads over cost of funds on newly originated loans higher throughout most of the year in part this was accomplished through the use of pricing floors on a significant amount of newly originated or renewed variable rate loans at yearend 2009 106 billion 263 of total loans had floors or other pricing characteristics that were “in the money” relative to their underlying pricing index plus spread offsetting this was the loss of interest income from nonperforming lending related assets which totaled 28 billion at yearend 2009 compared to 11 billion at yearend 2008 the cost of funding was favorably impacted by the significant increase in noninterestbearing deposits discussed above as well as both rate declines in all interestbearing deposit categories and a shift toward a lower cost mix of such deposits 

  

due to changes in newly originated and renewed loan spreads changes in the relationship between the prime rate and london interbank offer rate “libor” changes in the pattern of prime rate behavior in several of our banks and other factors our hedging strategy continued to be more difficult to conduct in 2009 in particular a number of our interest rate swaps were terminated that had ineffectiveness under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” no 815 derivatives and hedging  and the company elected not to replace them at historically low interest rates instead the company relied more on obtaining interest rate floors on new and renewed loans as discussed previously on the whole company management believes its actions continued to result in one of the highest and most stable net interest margins in the industry we believe that our risk position at december 31 2009 was more “asset sensitive” than has typically been the case 

as noted previously see “loan and deposit growth” the lowercost core deposit categories grew significantly during 2009 while reliance on highercost sources of funding was reduced in addition rates paid on most interestbearing funding sources declined significantly in 2009 compared to 2008 due to weak economic conditions and the federal reserve’s policy of maintaining low short term interest rates and injecting liquidity into the banking system these factors contributed significantly to an overall lower cost of funding in 2009 compared to 2008 and therefore to the maintenance of a relatively high net interest margin 

taxableequivalent net interest income in 2009 decreased 37 from 2008 the net interest margin declined to 394 for 2009 down from 418 for 2008 the company was able to achieve this performance despite rising levels of nonaccrual loans and other nonperforming assets and the impact of debt modification discount amortization these factors resulted in a fairly steady compression until the fourth quarter of the net interest margin

controlling expenses 

during 2009 the company’s efficiency expensetorevenue ratio improved to 613 from 675 for 2008 the efficiency ratio is the relationship between noninterest expense and total taxableequivalent revenue despite this improvement the efficiency ratio continued to be adversely impacted by the effect on revenue of the net impairment and valuation losses on securities as previously discussed because of the significant securities impairment and valuation losses the company believes that its efficiency ratio is not a particularly useful measure of how well operating expenses were contained in 2008 and 2009 nor does it believe that this measure is particularly useful for its peers many of which also experienced large losses and impairment charges as a result of market turmoil and deteriorating credit conditions noninterest expense increased 133 in 2009 compared to 2008 this increase resulted mainly from the increased provision for unfunded lending commitments oreo and creditrelated expenses and fdic premiums excluding the effects of these items noninterest expense decreased 21 in 2009 compared to 2008

capital 

as regulated financial institutions the parent and its subsidiary banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios one of our goals is to maintain capital levels that are at least “well capitalized” under regulatory standards the company and each of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the “well capitalized” guidelines at december 31 2009 in addition the parent and certain of its banking subsidiaries have issued various debt securities that have been rated by the principal rating agencies as a result another goal is to maintain capital at levels consistent with an “investment grade” rating for these debt securities the company has maintained its “investment grade” debt ratings from standard  poors fitch and dominion bond rating service but has a rating that is significantly below investment grade from moody’s 

during 2009 the company took a variety of actions that had the effect of augmenting its capital in the face of continuing operating losses and stress in its loan and securities portfolios collectively these actions totaled 106 billion and included 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 these actions are summarized in schedule 3 in deciding what capital actions to take company management has attempted to raise amounts prudently needed while causing as little dilution as possible to the ownership interests of existing shareholders under very difficult market conditions the results of this approach are shown in chart 11 and indicate that during 2009 the company added 368 to its core capital base while adding only 300 to common shares outstanding 

schedule 3 

tier 1 regulatory capital actions 

 

 

  

the company expects that it and the banking industry as a whole may be required by market forces andor regulation to operate with higher capital ratios than in the recent past in addition the cpp capital preferred dividend is scheduled to increase from 5 to 9 in 2013 making it more expensive as a source of capital if not redeemed at or prior to that time thus in addition to maintaining higher levels of capital the company’s capital structure may continue to be subject to greater variation over the next few years than has been true historically due to the still highly uncertain economic and regulatory environments therefore in 2010 continuing to preserve and augment capital in response to these uncertainties and in preparation for the eventual repayment of tarp cpp preferred stock are likely to take precedence over making capital investments to expand the business or returning capital to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases 

challenges to operations 

as we enter 2010 we see a number of significant challenges confronting the industry and our company 

global capital and funding markets remain under stress however domestic credit spreads from the related financing have narrowed significantly since the height of the downturn providing an improved operating environment for financial services companies nevertheless continued economic conditions may lead to 

 

  

 regulatory policy and actions have become increasingly subject to change and difficult to predict both in general and as they may be applied specifically to the company a number of proposals have been offered by the president the federal reserve members of congress and in international regulatory forums many of these proposals if enacted may have significant and adverse impacts on the company the ultimate effects of which are currently difficult to predict 

capital and funding markets have improved significantly during the latter half of 2009 but still remain somewhat stressed as we enter 2010 the degree to which this improvement is still dependent upon unprecedented actions by the federal reserve system to provide direct support to various markets is difficult to quantify therefore the potential for additional disruption may exist in the future if and when that support is withdrawn while the company by many measures has higher levels of capital and funding than it has had in a very long time the company like most financial institutions at some point may need to access capital and funding markets to support its operations the conditions under which the company can access those markets may remain highly uncertain in 2010 further as discussed previously the company may be required to repay the preferred stock issued under tarp at a time or in amounts that may be unfavorable 

these challenges and others are more fully discussed under “risk factors” on page 12 

  

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the notes to consolidated financial statements contain a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies we believe that an understanding of certain of these policies along with the related estimates that we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important in order to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following is a discussion of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value accounting 

effective january 1 2008 the company adopted asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  asc 820 defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements adoption of asc 820 for the measurement of all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities was delayed one year until january 1 2009 the adoption of asc 820 did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements but significantly expanded the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 

asc 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date to measure fair value asc 820 has established a hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs this hierarchy uses three levels of inputs to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities as follows 

level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities includes certain us treasury and other us government and agency securities actively traded in overthecounter markets certain securities sold not yet purchased and certain derivatives 

level 2 – observable inputs other than level 1 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in less active markets or other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data also includes derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with observable market inputs or that can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data this category generally includes certain us government and agency securities certain cdo securities corporate debt securities certain private equity investments certain securities sold not yet purchased and certain derivatives see “accounting for derivatives” on page 47 for further details on fair value accounting for derivatives 

level 3 – unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity for financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation additionally observable inputs such as nonbinding single dealer quotes that are not corroborated by observable market data are included in this category this category generally includes certain private equity investments and most cdo securities 

  

the company uses models when quotations are not available for certain securities or in markets where trading activity has slowed or ceased when quotations are not available and are not provided by third party pricing services management judgment is necessary to determine fair value in situations involving management judgment fair value is determined using discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models which incorporate available market information including appropriate benchmarking to similar instruments analysis of default and recovery rates estimation of prepayment characteristics and implied volatilities even when management exercises significant judgment in determining fair value the objective is the same to estimate the exit price of the asset or liability 

at december 31 2009 approximately 78 of total assets or 40 billion consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis of this amount 22 billion of these financial instruments used valuation methodologies involving marketbased or marketderived information collectively level 1 and 2 measurements to measure fair value approximately 18 billion of these financial assets are measured using modelbased techniques or nonbinding single dealer quotes both of which constitute level 3 measurements at december 31 2009 approximately 03 of total liabilities or 119 million consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2009 approximately 08 of total assets or 412 million of financial assets were valued on a nonrecurring basis 

estimates of fair value 

the company measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting examples of these include derivative instruments availableforsale and trading securities and private equity investments additionally fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc 825 examples of these nonrecurring uses of fair value include loans held for sale accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value impaired loans longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets depending on the nature of the asset or liability the company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating the instrument’s fair value these valuation techniques and assumptions are in accordance with asc 820 

fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants if observable market prices are not available then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measures asc 820 established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques between observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

fair values for some investment securities trading assets and most derivative financial instruments are based on independent third party market prices or if identical market prices are not available they are based on the market prices of similar instruments if available if market prices of similar instruments are not available instruments are valued based on the best available data some of which may not be readily observable in the market the fair values of loans held for sale are typically based on quotes from market participants the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties less estimated selling costs 

estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value if the carrying amount of the company’s investment in the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired in 

  

determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units management uses discounted cash flow models which require assumptions about growth rates of the reporting units and the cost of equity to the extent that adequate data is available other valuation techniques relying on market data may be incorporated into the estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value for longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates the life of the asset andor the fair value of the assets the company tests longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable

internal model 

in the third quarter of 2009 the company changed the way it forecasts the default assumption for private banks and nonperforming public banks within its collateralized debt obligation “cdo” pools beginning in the third quarter of 2008 the company used a combination of a licensed third party model for public companies in conjunction with third party ratings for private companies to forecast defaults of bank and insurance collateral the third party model estimated probabilities of default “pds” using a proprietary reduced form model derived using logistic regression on a historical default database because the licensed third party model required equity valuation related inputs along with other macro and issuer specific inputs to produce default probabilities the model did not produce results for private firms and some very small public firms without readily available market data the company utilized the third party model to calculate the average of the default probabilities by rating level of the public collateral and this rating level default probability was applied to each private issuer within the cdo pools when combined with pool specific collateral lists these pds created estimates of poollevel expected loss rates for each cdo 

this ratings bucketing approach for private issuers was replaced in the quarter ending september 30 2009 by a statistical regression using financial ratios which the company has identified as predictive of future bank failures for the private banks in the cdo pools as this credit cycle has progressed the company has an increasingly significant data set of failed banks the regression draws upon the quarterly call report ratios of failed banks for the four quarters prior to failure to determine one year default probabilities a five year default probability is calculated by assigning a mathematical relationship to the one year and five year default probabilities from the licensed third party model the updated model has a significantly stronger correlation with actual bank failures than in the prior method the company found this ratiobased approach produced higher default probabilities than the previous approach for private banks that subsequently failed during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 although both methods produced a comparable expected number of failures the ratio based approach exhibited better specificity in regard to predicting which banks would fail 

the inputs and regression formula were updated in the quarter ending december 31 2009 and will be updated quarterly to include the most recent available financial ratios and to utilize those financial ratios which have best predicted bank failures during this credit cycle 

the company has seen nearly all of the failures within its predominantly bank cdo pools come from those banks that have previously deferred the payment of interest on their trust preferred securities the terms of the securities within the cdo pools generally allow for deferral of current interest for five years without causing default the company found that for the public deferring banks the ratiobased approach generally resulted in higher pds than did the licensed third party model for banks that subsequently failed in the interest of better projecting public bank failures the company utilized the higher of pds from its ratiobased approach and those from the licensed third party model for public deferring banks effective for the quarters ending september 30 2009 and december 31 2009 

in the fourth quarter the company increased the ratiobased pds by a calibration adjustment of 78 the calibration adjustment was calculated as the average difference between the actual 100 default probability for all banks failing in the third or fourth quarter of 2009 both cdo and noncdo banks and the pd generated for each deferring bank using the ratio based approach ratio based pds for deferring banks were adjusted upward by the 78 from the level produced by the fourth quarter regression model the resulting effective pds ranged from 100 for the “worst” deferring banks to 82 for the “best” deferring bank the weighted average assumed loss rate on deferring collateral was 44 the change from the 35 assumed minimum loss rate used in the third quarter of 2009 was supported by the preponderance of all failures coming from higher default probability banks and the addition in the fourth quarter of 2009 of the calibration adjustment these assumption changes were not material with respect to their effect on either otti credit loss or fair value 

the company’s experience with deferring collateral was that 47 of the cdo collateral that elected to defer at or after january 2007 had subsequently defaulted by december 31 2009 and 53 remained within the allowable deferrable period as of that date 

  

the model for projecting expected cash flows for cdo tranches after identifying collateral level probabilities of default remains the same as disclosed in previous filings estimates of expected loss for the individual pieces of underlying collateral are aggregated to arrive at a poollevel expected loss rate for each cdo these loss assumptions are applied to the cdo’s structure to generate cash flow projections for each tranche of the cdo the presence otti is identified and the amount of the credit component of otti is calculated by discounting the resulting lossadjusted cash flows at each tranche’s coupon rate and comparing that value to the company’s amortized cost of the tranche the fair value of each tranche is determined by discounting its resultant lossadjusted cash flows with appropriate marketbased discount rates 

beginning in the quarter ending march 31 2009 the company began utilizing a more granular approach to reflect the specific risks embedded in every deal and to reference trading levels of publicly traded singleissuer trust preferred securities as a data point this change in inputsassumptions was driven by market developments and was not due to a change in accounting rules during the first quarter of 2009 

the discount rate assumption used for valuation purposes for each cdo tranche was derived from trading yields on publicly traded trust preferred securities and projected probabilities of default on the underlying issuers beginning in the quarter ending september 30 2009 the data set included a publicly traded trust preferred security which was in deferral with regard to the payment of current interest the discount margins on the traded securities including the deferring security were regressed to those of the cdos by comparing expected levels of cash flow impairments between the cdos and the publicly traded trust preferred securities 

for the quarter ending september 30 2009 the company increased the discount rate range to libor 375 for the highest qualitymost overcollateralized tranches and libor 1735 for the lowest credit quality tranche in order to reflect market level assumptions for structured finance securities in addition in order to acknowledge the greater uncertainty in the cash flows of those junior trust preferred cdo tranches which are “piking” capitalizing interest the company utilized a discount rate of at least libor  13 using the forward libor curve 

at december 31 2009 the company further increased the discount rate range to libor 375 for the highest qualitymost over collateralized tranches and libor  2465 for the lowest credit quality tranche in order to reflect market level assumptions for structured finance securities in addition in order to acknowledge the greater uncertainty in the cash flows of those junior trust preferred cdo tranches which are piking capitalizing interest the company utilized a discount rate of at least libor  13 using the forward libor curve these discount rates are in addition to the credit related discounts applied to the cash flows for each tranche the range of the projected cumulative credit loss of the cdo pools varies extensively across pools and ranges between 86 and 878 

cdo tranches with greater uncertainty in their cash flows should be discounted at higher rates than those that market participants would use for tranches with more stable expected cash flows eg as a result of more subordination andor better credit quality in the underlying collateral the high end of the discount margin spectrum was applied to tranches in which minor changes in future default assumptions produced substantial deterioration in tranche cash flows these discount rates are applied to creditstressed cash flows which constitute each tranche’s expected cash flows discount rates are not applied to a hypothetical contractual cash flow 

as shown in schedule 5 the fair value of bank and insurance cdos determined using an internal model declined 128 million from 1289 million at december 31 2008 to 1161 million at december 31 2009 in 2009 the company recorded net credit impairment of 163 million related to these cdo securities that were held in the portfolio at december 31 2009 the decline in fair value is due primarily to the use of generally higher discount rate assumptions at yearend 2009 versus 2008 and to deterioration of projected cash flows for particular securities during the year schedule 5 sets forth the fair values of securities held at december 31 2009 compared to their fair values at december 31 2008 by original ratings level the 2008 portion of the schedule presents securities in their 2009 ratings categories in order to isolate the 2009 changes to this securities portfolio 

  

the line titled “other” in the schedule includes additions to the portfolio in 2009 from the company purchasing securities from lockhart funding llc “lockhart” subtractions from the portfolio in 2009 due to securities sales and principal pay downs and transfers of securities from htm to afs during 2009 

schedule 5 

effect of bank and insurance cdo assumption changes and collateral changes on fair values 

 

  

2008 credit assumptions 0 recovery on deferrals and defaulted collateral performing collateral from tarp banks assumed to have a 40 recovery upon default and nontarp banks assumed to have a 10 recovery upon default 

2008 discount rate assumptions libor 60 weighted average discount margin with l22 minimum and l116 maximum 

2009 credit assumptions 0 recovery on defaults probability of default on deferrals calculated by the ratiobased probability of default plus a 78 calibration adjustment 

2009 discount rate assumptions libor 697 weighted average discount margin with l375 minimum piking tranches at a minimum of l13 and l2465 maximum 

the original arated securities in the htm portfolio are primarily from insurance only cdos which had lower discount rate assumptions at year end 2009 compared to year end 2008 

  

the following schedule sets forth the sensitivity of the current cdo fair values using an internal model to changes in the most significant assumptions utilized in the model 

schedule 6 

sensitivity of bank and insurance cdo valuations to adverse changes in current model key valuation assumptions 

 

  

    during the fourth quarter the company experienced adverse changes in the loss percentage from currently defaulted or deferring collateral and adverse changes in future cumulative projected credit losses the changes were driven by loss experience due to default in excess of projections future loss projections from previously performing institutions electing to defer current interest payments and the deterioration of ratios of certain institutions given the transfers of securities from heldtomaturity “htm” to availableforsale “afs” during the second quarter of 2009 the remaining htm portfolio is generally of better credit quality than the portion held in the afs portfolio see “investment securities portfolio” on page 91 for further information regarding the transfers of securities 

  

third party models 

at december 31 2009 the company utilized third party valuation services for fifteen securities with an aggregate amortized cost of 152 million in the abs cdo and trust preferred asset classes these securities continued to have insufficient observable market data available to directly determine prices the company reviewed all relevant data inputs and the appropriateness of key model methodologies and assumptions employed by third party models these assumptions included but were not limited to probability of default collateral recovery rates discount rates overcollateralization levels and rating transition probability matrices from rating agencies the model valuations obtained from third party services were evaluated for reasonableness including quarter to quarter changes in assumptions and comparison to other available data which included third party and internal model results and valuations a range of value estimates is not provided because third party vendors utilized point estimates 

auction rate and municipal securities with an amortized cost of 208 million were valued using third party matrix referencing ratings as the key variable with regards to valuation 

dealer quotes 

the 31 million of assetbacked securities at amortized cost are valued using nonbinding and unadjusted dealer quotes multiple quotes are not available and the values provided are based on a combination of proprietary dealer quotes broker disclosure levels vary and the company seeks to minimize dependence on this level 3 source 

cds spreads 

a total of 53 million at amortized cost of insured securities were valued using the relevant monoline insurers’ credit derivative levels 

in addition a total of 15 million of municipal securities with puts back to the underwriter in 2010 were valued using the cds spread of the underwriter

otherthantemporary impairment “otti” – debt investment securities 

we review investment debt securities on an ongoing basis with formal reviews for the presence of otti performed quarterly net otti losses on individual investment securities are recognized as a realized loss through earnings when it is more likely than not that the company will not collect sufficient contractual cash flows as compared to its amortized cost or the company is unable to hold the securities to recovery 

the company’s otti evaluation process conforms to the rules as required by the debt securities subsequent measurement topic in asc 320 these rules require the company to take into consideration current market conditions fair value in relationship to cost extent and nature of change in fair value issuer rating changes and trends volatility of earnings current analysts’ evaluations all available information relevant to the collectability of debt securities our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of amortized cost which may be maturity and other factors when evaluating for the existence of otti in our securities portfolio 

on january 12 2009 the fasb amended the debt securities subsequent measurement topic in asc 320 this amendment is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december 15 2008 applied prospectively the amendment eliminated the requirement that a holder’s best estimate of cash flows be based upon those that “a market participant” would use instead the amendment requires that otti be recognized as a realized loss through earnings when it is “probable” there has been an adverse change in the holder’s estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously projected to determine amortized cost 

  

on april 9 2009 the fasb amended the debt securities subsequent measurement topic in asc 320 this amendment was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment for prior otti illiquidity losses with the option to early adopt for the first quarter of 2009 the company elected to early adopt this amendment during the first quarter of 2009 the company recorded a 1375 million after tax cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of the amendment retained earnings were increased and accumulated other comprehensive income decreased the amendment significantly changes how an entity evaluates whether impairment is other than temporary and how to recognize otti for debt securities classified as availableforsale or heldtomaturity 

the three most significant changes that impacted the determination and calculation of otti are first a requirement that an entity conclude it does not intend to sell an impaired security and it is not “more likely than not” that it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis second a requirement to assess the collectability of cash flows based on “a more likely than not” basis as compared to the “probable” basis under the prior accounting rule finally a requirement to recognize the total otti charge for debt securities in separate amounts – one amount representing the decrease in cash flows expected to be collected “credit loss” which is recognized in earnings and the second amount representing the amount related to all other factors “illiquidity loss” which is recognized in oci also for securities classified as heldtomaturity the amendment requires that the amount of otti recognized in oci be accreted through oci over the remaining life of the security 

the company recognized pretax otti losses of 5699 million during 2009 and 3040 million during 2008 on investment debt securities all of the impairment for 2009 related to securities valued using level 3 inputs management determined that 2894 million of the impairment in 2009 was due to noncreditrelated losses on securities not expected to be sold resulting in a net impairment of 2805 million the significant inputs used in the methodology to calculate the credit loss impairment is described under “valuation of assetbacked securities” on page 37 with the exception that while the discount rate used for valuation is a market level discount rate the discount rate used to determine the presence and amount of credit impairment is the security specific coupon rate the expected cash flows are credit stressed in that they incorporate the effect of both collateral nonperformance and projected additional nonperformance 

the decision to deem these securities otti was based on a specific analysis of the structure of each security and an evaluation of the underlying collateral future reviews for otti will consider the particular facts and circumstances during the reporting period in review 

allowance for credit losses 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios along with other relevant factors these evaluations are inherently subjective and require us to make numerous assumptions estimates and judgments 

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type for commercial loans we use historical loss experience factors by loan segment adjusted for changes in trends and conditions to help determine an indicated allowance for each segment based on individual loan grades these factors are evaluated and updated using migration analysis techniques and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific portfolio segment the other considerations used in our analysis include volumes and trends of delinquencies levels of nonaccrual loans repossessions and bankruptcies trends in criticized and classified loans and expected losses on loans secured by real estate in addition new credit products and policies economic conditions concentrations of credit risk and the experience and abilities of lending personnel are also taken into consideration 

  

in addition to the segment evaluations nonaccrual loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of 500 thousand or more as well as all loans designated as troubled debt restructurings are individually evaluated in accordance with asc 310 receivables to determine the level of impairment and establish a specific reserve 

the allowance for consumer loans is determined using historically developed loss experience “roll rates” at which loans migrate from one delinquency level to the next higher level using average roll rates for the most recent period currently six months and comparing projected losses to actual loss experience the model estimates the expected losses in dollars for the forecasted period of twelve months by refreshing the model with updated data it is able to project losses for a new twelvemonth period each month segmenting the portfolio into twelve consumer loan product groupings and four bankcard product groupings with similar risk profiles the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios’ models implicitly take into consideration housing price depreciation appreciation and homeowners’ loss gain of equity in the collateral by incorporating current roll rates and loss severity rates the models make no assumptions about future housing price changes this methodology is an accepted industry practice and the company believes it has a sufficient volume of information to produce reliable projections 

as a final step to the evaluation process we perform an additional review of the adequacy of the allowance based on the loan portfolio in its entirety this enables us to mitigate but not eliminate the imprecision inherent in loan and segmentlevel estimates of expected credit losses this review of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any adjustments necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and concentration risks 

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses some are quantitative while others require us to make qualitative judgments although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses which would negatively impact the company’s results of operations in future periods as an example if a total of 15 billion of “pass” grade loans were to be immediately classified as “special mention” “substandard” and “doubtful” in the same proportion as the existing criticized and classified loans to the whole portfolio the quantitatively determined amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2009 would increase by approximately 128 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in the level of the criticized and classified loans may have on the allowance estimation process we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the potential losses in the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated and actual losses and update our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses we have recently enhanced our internal loan loss database to provide the ability to refine our segmentation by bank loan segment and loan grade during 2009 this enhancement allowed management to calculate loan loss migration factors that are selfcorrecting in that they are more weighted toward recent loss experience this enhancement provided management with loss factors applicable to adversely graded credits that reflect more recent loss experience for the portfolio and which facilitated management’s decision to increase the allowance for credit losses during mid2009 as credit quality was deteriorating at an accelerated pace these loss factors currently are based on the most recent six months loss rates for consumer loans and the higher of the most recent six or twelve month loss rates for commercial loans a preliminary reserve is then calculated that is adequate to cover one year of losses at that loss rate for consumer loans and 15 years for commercial loans the final reserve is then adjusted to incorporate management’s judgment regarding several qualitative factors 

  

allowance for loan losses for fdicsupported loans 

the determination of the allowance for loan losses for fdicsupported loans follows the same process described above however this allowance is only established for credit deterioration subsequent to the date of acquisition and represents our estimate of the inherent losses in excess of the book value of fdicsupported loans the allowance for loan losses for loans acquired in fdicsupported transactions is determined without giving consideration to the amounts recoverable through loss sharing agreements since the loss sharing agreements are separately accounted for and thus presented “gross” on the balance sheet the provision for loan losses is reported net of changes in the amounts recoverable under the loss sharing agreements 

reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

the company also estimates a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit we determine the reserve for unfunded lending commitments using a process that is similar to the one we use for commercial loans based on historical experience we have developed experiencebased loss factors that we apply to the company’s unfunded lending commitments to estimate the potential for loss arising from those commitments the reserve is included with other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet with any related increases or decreases in the reserve included in noninterest expense in the statement of income 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill arises from business acquisitions and represents the value attributable to the unidentifiable intangible elements in our acquired businesses goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other  the company performs this annual test as of october 1 of each year evaluations are also performed on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place such events could include among others a significant adverse change in the business climate a significant adverse change in market values of similar businesses an adverse action by a regulator an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit 

the first step in this evaluation process is to determine if a potential impairment exists in any of the company’s reporting units and if required from the results of this step a second step measures the amount of any impairment loss the computations required by steps 1 and 2 require us to make a number of estimates and assumptions in completing step 1 we determine the fair value of the reporting unit that is being evaluated in determining the fair value we generally calculate value using a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies in the western and southwestern states “market value” comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states “transaction value” and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash or income flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we use a similar methodology in evaluating impairment in nonbank subsidiaries but generally assess companies and acquisition transactions at a national level in the analysis 

  

the company applies a control premium in the market value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to benefit from synergies and other intangible assets that arise from control that might cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of historical recent bank transactions within the company’s geographic footprint comparing market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value the company determined that a control premium of 25 was appropriate 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition loan losses changes in revenue growth trends cost structures and technology changes in discount rates changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations and changes in industry conditions 

if step 1 indicates a potential impairment of a reporting unit step 2 requires us to estimate the “implied fair value” of the goodwill of the reporting unit this process estimates the fair value of the unit’s individual assets and liabilities in the same manner as if a purchase of the reporting unit were taking place to do this we must determine the fair value of the assets liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit based upon the best available information we estimate the fair market value of all of the tangible assets identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the associated reporting units in accordance with the principles of asc 820 loans deposits with maturities and debt are fair valued using standard software and assumptions used by zions in its interest rate risk management processes and using other estimates such as credit assumptions to comply with asc 820 deposits with no maturities are valued at book value larger occupied properties are appraised while for smaller properties and furniture fixtures and equipment it is assumed that depreciated book value approximates fair market value if the implied fair value of goodwill calculated in step 2 is less than the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit an impairment is indicated and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 

during the first quarter of 2009 we performed a goodwill impairment evaluation for amegy and cbt effective february 28 2009 due to the company’s performance deterioration and market decline of bank stocks in those markets from december 31 2008 step 1 was performed by using both market value and discounted cash flow approaches in the market value approach we identified a group of publicly traded banks using primarily size location and business mix compared to zions’ subsidiary banks we then used valuation multiples including a control premium developed from this group to apply to our subsidiary banks due to the limited number of nondistressed or nonfailed bank merger and acquisition transactions during the past 12 months the transaction value approach was not used in this analysis in the discounted cash flow approach we discounted projected cash flows to their present value using an estimated longterm cost of equity specific to each reporting unit to arrive at our estimate of fair value 

upon completion of step 1 of the evaluation process we concluded that potential impairment primarily existed at the company’s amegy reporting unit step 2 was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation consultant and the company’s internal valuation resources and resulted in 6340 million of impairment losses in the first quarter of 2009 

during the fourth quarter of 2009 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation for the entire organization effective october 1 2009 step 1 was performed by using the discounted cashflow approach for all reporting units and in cases where similar publicly traded comparables existed the comparable market value approach was also used in the discounted cash flow approach we discounted projected cash flows to their present value to derive our estimate of fair value in instances where the market value approach was used we identified a group of publicly traded banks using primarily size location and business mix compared to zions’ subsidiary banks we then used valuation multiples including a control premium developed from this group to apply to our subsidiary banks from these purchase prices we developed a set of valuation multiples which we applied to our subsidiary banks the transaction value approach was not used in this analysis due to the limited number of nondistressed or nonfailed bank merger transactions that occurred over the past 12 months 

  

upon completion of step 1 of the evaluation process we concluded that none of our bank affiliates were impaired however potential impairment existed at the welman holdings inc reporting unit step 2 was completed with the company’s internal accounting and valuation resources determining that all the goodwill associated with welman holdings inc was impaired resulting in 22 million of impairment loss additionally we determined that the fair values of the reporting units of amegy cbt and zions bank exceed their carrying values by 7 6 and 23 respectively 

this evaluation process required us to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the company’s reporting units and actual values may differ significantly from these estimates such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would in turn negatively impact the company’s results of operations and the business segments where the goodwill is recorded significant remaining amounts of goodwill at december 31 2009 were as follows amegy – 616 million cbt – 379 million and zions bank – 20 million 

at september 30 2009 the company’s fair value of its reporting units exceeded the market value of the company’s common equity by approximately 20 billion the company reconciled those values as of september 30 2009 by attempting to identify items priced into the market equity value but not in the fair value of the company’s reporting units these reconciling items were based on market expectation of future loan losses and future credit otti and high levels of short interest in the company’s common stock we believe applying a 25 control premium and the above mentioned factors explains the 20 billion difference between book and market equity values 

we expect that the current disrupted market conditions may require us to evaluate goodwill more frequently including quarterly as circumstances warrant any differences between estimated fair values and carrying values could result in future impairment of goodwill 

accounting for derivatives 

our interest rate risk management strategy involves hedging the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so as to mitigate adverse effects on the company’s net interest margin and cash flows from changes in interest rates while we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading we consider it prudent to use certain derivative instruments to add stability to the company’s interest income and expense to modify the duration of specific assets and liabilities and to manage the company’s exposure to interest rate movements 

additionally the company executes derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and options futures contracts forward currency exchange contracts and energy commodity swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies those derivatives are immediately hedged by offsetting derivative contracts such that the company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions the company does not use credit default swaps in its investment or hedging operations 

as of december 31 2009 the recorded amounts of derivative assets classified in other assets and derivative liabilities classified in other liabilities were 142 million and 86 million respectively when quoted market prices are not available the valuation of derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates commodity prices and implied volatilities the estimates of fair value are made by an independent third party using a standardized methodology that nets the discounted expected future cash receipts and cash payments based on observable market inputs these future net cash flows however are susceptible to change due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates most significantly foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as a result the estimated values of these derivatives will change over time as cash is received and paid and as market conditions change as these changes take place they may have a positive or negative impact on our estimated valuations based on the nature and 

  

limited purposes of the derivatives that the company employs fluctuations in interest rates have only had a modest effect on its results of operations as such fluctuations are generally expected to be countered by offsetting changes in income expense andor values of assets and liabilities however the company retains basis risk due to changes between the prime rate and libor on nonhedge derivative basis swaps 

in addition to making the valuation estimates we also face the risk that certain derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges and currently meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of asc 815 may not qualify in the future as “highly effective” as well as the risk that hedged transactions in cash flow hedging relationships may no longer be considered probable to occur further new interpretations and guidance related to asc 815 may be issued in the future and we cannot predict the possible impact that such guidance may have on our use of derivative instruments going forward 

although the majority of the company’s hedging relationships have been designated as cash flow hedges for which hedge effectiveness is assessed and measured using a “long haul” approach the company also had five fair value hedging relationships which were terminated during the first quarter of 2009 that were designated using the “shortcut” method the company believes that the shortcut method was appropriate for those hedges because we had precisely complied with the documentation requirements and each of the applicable shortcut criteria during 2009 there was no hedge ineffectiveness required to be reported in earnings on the company’s outstanding cash flow hedging relationships however the company reclassified 1047 million from other comprehensive income to earnings during 2009 as the hedged forecasted transactions related to certain terminated cash flow hedging relationships became probable not to occur this income is included in fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss 

futures contracts are primarily highly liquid exchangetraded federal funds futures contracts that are traded to manage interest rate risk on certain cdo securities these identified mixed straddle trades are executed to convert three and sixmonth fixed cash flows into cash flows that vary with daily fluctuations in interest rates because of daily settlement of valuation changes there is no recording of fair values in the financial statements 

derivative contracts can be exchangetraded or overthecounter “otc” the company’s exchangetraded derivatives consist of forward currency exchange contracts which are part of the company’s services provided to commercial customers exchangetraded derivatives are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as the values of these derivatives are obtained from quoted prices in active markets for identical contracts 

the company’s otc derivatives consist of interest rate swaps and options as well as energy commodity derivatives for customers the company has classified its otc derivatives in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the significant inputs to the overall valuations are based on marketobservable data or information derived from or corroborated by marketobservable data including marketbased inputs to models model calibration to marketclearing transactions broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency where models are used the selection of a particular model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market the company generally uses similar models to value similar instruments valuation models require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices yield curves credit curves measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets such as generic forwards swaps and options model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 

to comply with the provisions of asc 820 the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its otc derivatives the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives which incorporates both the current and potential 

  

future exposure and then applying each counterparty’s credit spread to the applicable exposure for derivatives with twoway exposure such as interest rate swaps the counterparty’s credit spread is applied to the company’s exposure to the counterparty and the company’s own credit spread is applied to the counterparty’s exposure to the company and the net credit valuation adjustment is reflected in the company’s derivative valuations the total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using marketobservable inputs such as yield curves and volatilities for the company’s own credit spread and for counterparties having publicly available credit information the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider for counterparties without publicly available credit information which are primarily commercial banking customers the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations are estimated by the company based on current market conditions including consideration of current borrowing spreads for similar customers and transactions review of existing collateralization or other credit enhancements and changes in credit sector and entityspecific credit information in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk the company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings current threshold amounts mutual puts and guarantees additionally the company actively monitors counterparty credit ratings for significant changes 

as of december 31 2009 the net credit valuation adjustments reduced the settlement values of the company’s derivative assets and liabilities by 20 million and 16 million respectively during 2009 the company recognized a gain of 30 million related to credit valuation adjustments on nonhedge derivative instruments which is included in noninterest income various factors impact changes in the credit valuation adjustments over time including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts as well as changes in market rates and volatilities which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments 

although the company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize level 3 inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties however as of december 31 2009 the company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives as a result the company has classified its otc derivative valuations in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

when appropriate valuations are also adjusted for various factors such as liquidity and bidoffer spreads which factors were deemed immaterial by the company as of december 31 2009 

sharebased compensation 

the company used the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2009 also the blackscholes optionpricing model was used to estimate the value of stock options for all stock option grants prior to 2007 and offcycle stock option grants during 2007 and 2008 the assumptions used to apply this model include a weighted average riskfree interest rate a weighted average expected life an expected dividend yield and an expected volatility the 2009 stock options grant assumptions for significant grants were 224 for the weighted average riskfree interest rate 45 years for the weighted average expected life 10 for the expected dividend yield and 330 for the expected volatility use of these assumptions is subjective and requires management judgment to determine the assumptions used in the model as described in note 17 during 2009 the company granted 714085 stock options and 698311 shares of restricted stock 

from april 2425 2008 the company successfully conducted an auction of its employee stock option appreciation rights securities “esoars” as allowed by asc 718 the company used the results of that auction to value its primary grant of employee stock options issued on april 24 2008 the value established was 573 per option which the company estimates is approximately 24 below its blackscholes model valuation on that date the company recorded the related estimated future settlement obligation of esoars as a liability in the balance sheet the 2008 stock option expense for these grants was 22 million if the esoars value was 

  

10 lower the expense would be 20 million and if the esoars value was 10 higher the expense would be 24 million additionally the primary grant of options in 2007 was valued with the results of an esoars auction in 2007 the number of stock options granted at the primary grant dates on may 4 2007 and april 24 2008 were 963680 and 1542238 respectively or 914 and 608 of the total stock options granted in 2007 and 2008 respectively 

on october 22 2007 the company announced it had received notification from the sec that its esoars are sufficiently designed as a marketbased method for valuing employee stock options under asc 718 the sec staff did not object to the company’s view that the marketclearing price of esoars in the company’s auction was a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the underlying employee stock options 

the accounting for stock option compensation under asc 718 decreased 2009 income before income taxes by 96 million and net earnings applicable to common shareholders by 68 million or 005 per diluted share as compared to 131 million 92 million and 008 respectively in 2008 see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on stock options and restricted stock 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where it conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

the company had net deferred tax assets “dtas” of 498 million at december 31 2009 compared to 479 million at december 31 2008 the most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to 1 the allowance for loan losses and 2 fair value adjustments or impairment writedowns related to securities no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2009 related to dtas except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank subsidiary in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of dtas were evaluated the ultimate realization of dtas is based on the company’s ability to carryback net operating losses to prior tax periods tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible the reversal of deductible temporary differences that can be offset by taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 

the company has available carryback potential to offset federal tax of approximately 107 million and 340 million in the 2008 and 2007 tax years respectively during 2009 the company does anticipate a net operating loss for tax purposes that will largely offset the taxable income for the 2007 tax year in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company entered into certain identified mixed straddle transactions for the management of interest rate risk on certain of its investment assets these transactions not only increased the 2009 net operating loss but also decreased the dtas that existed at december 31 2009 by approximately 150 million 

tax planning strategies represent a source of positive evidence that must be considered when assessing the need for a valuation allowance tax planning strategies must be prudent and feasible and within the control of the company something that a company might not ordinarily implement but would implement to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in the realization of dtas the company has evaluated a number of tax planning strategies that if implemented could result in the realization of a majority of the net dta balance that exists at december 31 2009 these strategies mainly involve the sale of highly appreciated assets eg certain fixed assets publiclytraded securities and insurance policies management would not expect that the execution of any of the actions would involve a significant amount of expense 

  

the company has taxable temporary differences or deferred tax liabilities “dtls” that will reverse and offset dtas in the periods prior to the expiration of any benefits based on our analysis and experience the general reversal pattern of dtls against dtas would be somewhat similar in character and timing because of this generally consistent reversal pattern we believe it is appropriate to reduce our gross dtas by our dtls 

the company has a strong history of positive earnings and has generated significant levels of net income in 42 out of the previous 45 years while the recent economic downturn has been severe the company has consistently maintained strong levels of pretax precreditcost income the company is well positioned in the highest growth areas in the country and is fundamentally strong in its capital liquidity business practices and has actually grown its customer base during the current economic downturn the company has a long history of profitability and is expected to be profitable again in the near future the company is relying on future taxable income to realize a small amount of its dta and expects to generate this income through 2011 

after evaluating all of the factors previously summarized and considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence management has concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize the existing dtas and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits the company has tax reserves at december 31 2009 of approximately 62 million net of federal andor state benefits for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions 

pending adoption of accounting pronouncements 

on june 12 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 200916 incorporated in asc 860 transfers and servicing  to address transfer and servicing accounting practices that have developed and concerns of financial statement users that many of the financial assets that have been derecognized should continue to be reported in the financial statements of transferors additionally because of significant events in the credit markets financial statement users have expressed concerns about the transparency of disclosures regarding the nature and extent of a transferor continuing involvement with transferred financial assets the objective of asu 200916 is to improve the comparability relevance and transparency of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a transfer of financial assets the effects of a transfer on its financial position financial performance and cash flows and a transferor’s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets to meet those objectives asu 200916 clarifies several key principles of the derecognition criteria 

based on the new conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset many transfers that have occurred in which the transferor transfers a senior interest and retains a subordinated interest in the contractual cash flows of a specified asset will not qualify for sale accounting in the future also future transactions that involve participations transfers of undivided interests and syndications will require additional accounting analysis to determine if the transaction qualifies for transfer accounting asu 200916 is effective for enterprises in fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 the company will adopt the asu as of january 1 2010 as required and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to be significant to the company’s financial statements 

on june 12 2009 the fasb issued asu 200917 which amends certain of the key provisions of asc 810 consolidation  asu 200917 responds to certain concerns about the application of provisions of asc 810 such as the complexity involved with determining the primary beneficiary and concern over the lack of transparency 

  

of enterprises’ involvement with off balance sheet structures asu 200917 eliminates the qualifying specialpurpose entity scope exceptions and revises guidance for determining whether equity lacks the characteristics of a controlling financial interest the asu also revises guidance on whether decision makerservice provider fees are variable interests indicates that only substantive terms transactions and arrangements should be considered and provides new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity finally the asu requires additional interim and annual disclosures and subjects more entities to consolidation assessments and reassessments asu 200917 is effective for enterprises in fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 the company will adopt the asu as of january 1 2010 as required and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to be significant to the company’s financial statements 

results of operations 

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interestbearing assets and interest incurred on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest component of zions’ revenue for the year 2009 it was 705 of our taxableequivalent revenues compared to 913 in 2008 and 822 in 2007 the decreased percentage for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the 2009 gain on subordinated debt modification of 5089 million and acquisition related gains of 1692 million which increased total taxableequivalent revenues the increased percentage for 2008 over 2007 was mainly due to the net impairment and valuation losses on securities which reduced total taxableequivalent revenues by 3171 million in 2008 and 1582 million in 2007 on a taxableequivalent basis net interest income for 2009 was down 745 million or 37 from 2008 which was up 873 million or 46 from 2007 the decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income for 2009 was mainly due to the impact of increased nonaccrual loans securities on nonaccrual status and higher average money market balances earning lower interest rates the increase in taxableequivalent net interest income for 2008 was mainly due to increased interestearning assets driven by loan growth and partially offset by declines of 25 basis points in the net interest margin for 2008 the incremental tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all years discussed and presented 

by its nature net interest income is especially vulnerable to changes in the mix and amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in the interest rates and yields associated with these assets and liabilities significantly impact net interest income see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 116 for a complete discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and associated risk 

a gauge that we use to measure the company’s success in managing its net interest income is the level and stability of the net interest margin the net interest margin was 394 in 2009 compared with 418 in 2008 and 443 in 2007 for the fourth quarter of 2009 the company’s net interest margin was 381 which was reduced by 28 basis points due to the impact of the subordinated debt discount amortization in addition the net interest margin continued to be under pressure due to the level of nonaccrual assets and interest reversals as loans moved into nonaccrual status 

the decreased net interest margin for 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from increased nonaccrual loans and securities the impact of the discount amortization on the modified subordinated debt including the effect of the conversion of subordinated debt into series c preferred stock and higher money market investment balances earning lower rates this was offset in part by a lower cost mix of deposit funding lower rates paid on interestbearing deposits and larger incremental spreads on new loan generation average loans and leases increased 07 billion due to the acquisition of fdicsupported loans and average money market investments increased 05 billion due to strong growth in certain deposit categories which the company chose not to invest in longerduration securities average interestbearing deposits increased 34 billion from 2008 with the increase being driven primarily by money market and savings deposits average borrowed funds decreased 53 billion compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased borrowing from the federal home loan bank “fhlb” and the federal reserve average noninterestbearing deposits increased 19 billion compared to 2008 and were 258 

  

of total average deposits for 2009 compared to 243 for 2008 the net interest margin for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by 5 basis points for the discount amortization on the modified subordinated debt and an additional 7 basis points from the impact of accelerated debt discount amortization resulting from the conversion of subordinated debt into series c preferred stock 

the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2009 was 352 which decreased from 368 for 2008 the spread on average interestbearing funds for 2009 was adversely impacted by the same factors that reduced the net interest margin 

the decreased net interest margin for 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from increased nonperforming assets reducing average asset yields loan yields dropping more than deposit rates a decline in noninterestbearing demand deposits competitive pricing pressures and purchases of low yielding lockhart commercial paper average loans and leases increased 42 billion and average money market investments increased 11 billion due to the impact of the capital investment from the us treasury and purchases of commercial paper from lockhart average interestbearing deposits increased 20 billion from 2007 with the increase being driven primarily by higher cost internet money market brokered and foreign deposits average borrowed funds increased 30 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased borrowing from the fhlb and the federal reserve average noninterestbearing deposits declined 257 million compared to 2007 and were 243 of total average deposits for 2008 compared to 262 for 2007 

the net interest margin will continue to be adversely affected in future quarters due to the impact of nonperforming assets and amortization of debt discounts related to the debt modification transactions also the net interest margin was previously favorably impacted by accreted swap gains on terminated swaps that reduced interest expense on longterm subordinated debt the debt modification transaction during 2009 reduced the unrecognized swaps gains the debt modification transaction also resulted in a discount on the modified convertible subordinated debt which as of december 31 2009 was approximately 616 million this discount will be amortized as interest expense over the remaining life of the debt using an interest method if in future periods debt holders exercise their option to convert debt to preferred stock the amortization of the discount will be accelerated at the time of conversion 

the company expects to continue its efforts over the long run to maintain a slightly “assetsensitive” position with regard to interest rate risk however because of the current low interest rate environment the company is allowing the balance sheet to become more assetsensitive than has historically been the case by 1 reducing our use of interest rate swaps against our floating rate loans 2 terminating receive fixed  pay variable swaps on the company’s subordinated debt and 3 using certain straddle transactions on the cdo portfolio to manage interest rate risk as of december 31 2009 the company had 09 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges down from 24 billion one year ago such swaps are used to protect net interest income from declining in a falling rate environment by countering the effect of lost revenue on loans with interest rates at historically low levels there is a reduced need to protect against falling interest rates our estimate of the company’s actual rate risk position is highly dependent upon changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates modeling assumptions and the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes for further details on interest rate risk see “interest rate risk” on page 117

schedule 8 analyzes the yeartoyear changes in net interest income on a fully taxableequivalent basis for the years indicated for purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans however interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions in addition interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates 

schedule 8 

analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate 

 

  

  in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate changes due to the volumerate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate both increase the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate when the rate increases and volume decreases the variance is allocated to the rate 

  

provisions for credit losses 

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that based on our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks in the portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs and statistical trends and other economic factors see “credit risk management” on page 103 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

for the year 2009 the provision for loan losses was 20169 million compared to 6483 million for 2008 and 1522 million for 2007 the increased provision for 2009 was attributable to a higher level of criticized and classified loans higher realized loss content in these loan categories and continued deterioration in collateral values primarily in construction and land development loans all of which resulted in increases of some of our loss migration factors and application of the updated factors at all banking subsidiaries using the most recent loss experience see “nonperforming assets” and “allowance for credit losses” on pages 110 and 112 for further details net loan and lease chargeoffs increased to 11726 million in 2009 up from 3937 million in 2008 and 636 million in 2007 the 7789 million increase during 2009 was driven by increased net chargeoffs of 2948 million at nsb 1797 million at zions bank 1191 million at amegy 826 million at cbt and 670 million at nba primarily related to the commercial real estate and commercial lending portfolios including the provision for unfunded lending commitments the total provision for credit losses was 20824 million for 2009 6497 million for 2008 and 1540 million for 2007 the provision for loan losses was 3907 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and net chargeoffs for the quarter were 2921 million 

the company’s expectation is that credit costs will improve slowly in 2010 due to a stabilization of economic conditions we expect provisioning and net chargeoffs to be modestly lower for at least the next several quarters than the recent elevated levels of credit costs 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues the company earns for products and services that have no interest rate or yield associated with them noninterest income for 2009 comprised 295 of taxableequivalent revenues compared to 87 for 2008 and 178 for 2007 schedule 9 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

  

schedule 9 

noninterest income 

 

 noninterest income for 2009 increased 6134 million or 3217 compared to 2008 the largest components of this increase were 1692 million of acquisition related gains and the 5089 million gain on subordinated debt modification offset by 4926 million of net impairment and valuation losses on securities fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss also increased 1618 million noninterest income for 2008 decreased 2216 million or 537 compared to 2007 the largest component of this decrease was a 1589 million increase in impairment and valuation losses on securities other significant components contributing to the noninterest income decrease in 2008 included loan sales and servicing income income from securities conduit fair value and nonhedge derivative loss and net equity securities gains 

service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased 56 million in 2009 and 234 million in 2008 the increased fees for 2009 primarily related to the acquisitions previously discussed and reduced business deposit account earnings credits due to lower interest rates the increase in 2008 was mainly due to the impact of fee increases across the company and reduced deposit account earnings credits due to lower interest rates 

other service charges commissions and fees which are comprised of automated teller machine “atm” fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit card interchange fees cash management fees lending commitment fees syndication and servicing fees and other miscellaneous fees decreased 112 million or 67 from 2008 which was down 17 from 2007 the decrease in 2009 was due to lower lending related fees official check fees mutual fund commission fees and cash management related fees offset by increased accounts receivable factoring fees the decrease in 2008 was principally due to lower lending related fees and official check fees offset by increased accounts receivable factoring fees debit card fees and cash management related fees the cash management fees include remote check imaging fees thirdparty ach transaction fees and webbased medical claims transaction fees 

trust and wealth management income for 2009 decreased 204 compared to 2008 which was up 33 compared to 2007 the decrease for 2009 was primarily due to lower fees from our trust and wealth management 

  

business resulting from lower balances of assets under management and lower 12b1 mutual fund fees due to lower balances the increase for 2008 was from modest organic growth in the trust and wealth management business partially offset by declines in fees due primarily to declines in market values of a number of asset classes 

capital markets and foreign exchange includes trading income public finance fees foreign exchange income and other capital market related fees and increased 08 from 2008 which was up 144 from 2007 the increase in 2008 was primarily driven by increased trading income partially offset by lower public finance fees

income from securities conduit decreased 44 million or 800 for 2009 compared to 2008 and decreased 698 between 2008 and 2007 this income represents fees we received from lockhart a qspe securities conduit the decrease in income is due to the termination of lockhart see “termination of offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 103 “liquidity management actions” on page 123 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding securitizations and lockhart

schedule 10 

fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss 

 

   

during 2009 1047 million was accelerated from other comprehensive income to earnings related to certain terminated cash flow hedging relationships the losses on nonhedge derivatives for 2008 and 2007 resulted from decreasing spreads between libor and the prime rate during the second half of 2007 in an effort to employ the most liquid instrument available for zions’ hedging program and execute transactions with the most economically favorable terms it has been zions’ practice to use libor as the floating index on swaps executed with external counterparties as a significant portion of the company’s loan assets are prime rate floating loans many of the company’s swaps are structured with a prime floating rate in conjunction with the execution of swaps in which the company receives a fixed rate and pays prime zions also executes a swap in which it pays libor plus a spread and receives prime the company therefore has chosen to retain the primelibor basis risk in this hedging activity 

net equity securities losses in 2009 were 18 million compared to net gains of 08 million in 2008 and 177 million in 2007 net losses for 2009 included gains of 44 million on various investments offset by a 35 million impairment loss on the company’s investment in a public company and net losses of 27 million on venture capital equity investments net gains for 2008 included a 124 million gain on the visa stock redemption a 77 million gain on the sale of an interest in a mutual fund management company an 110 million impairment loss on the company’s investment in farmer mac and net losses of 84 million on venture capital equity investments

in 2009 the company recorded a gain on subordinated debt modification of 5089 million the company exchanged approximately 02 billion of subordinated notes for new notes with the same terms the remaining 12 billion of subordinated notes were modified to permit conversion on a par for par basis into either the company’s series a or series c preferred stock 

acquisition related gains were 1692 million which resulted from the company’s acquisition of failed banks from the fdic with loss sharing agreements the company recognized 1465 million in gains resulting from the acquisition of vineyard bank a failed financial institution acquired from the fdic on july 17 2009 the gains resulted from the acquisition of assets that had fair values in excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed the company also recognized acquisitions related gains of 227 million from the acquisition of the failed alliance bank on february 6 2009 by california bank  trust and great basin bank on april 17 2009 by nevada state bank the acquisitions involved loss sharing arrangements with the fdic

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense for 2009 increased 133 over 2008 which was 50 higher than in 2007 the 2009 increase was impacted by the increased provision for unfunded lending commitments other real estate expense and credit related expenses due to the deterioration in the company’s loan credit quality additionally fdic expense increased due to the higher premiums the fdic has assessed on the company’s banks excluding these expenses noninterest expense decreased 295 million or 21 from 2008 schedule 11 summarizes the major components of noninterest expense and provides a comparison of the components over the past three years 

schedule 11 

noninterest expense 

 

 the company’s efficiency ratio was 613 for 2009 compared to 675 for 2008 and 605 for 2007 the efficiency ratio has been significantly impacted due to the previously discussed impairment and valuation losses on securities acquisition related gains and the gain on subordinated debt modification 

salary costs for 2009 decreased 20 from 2008 which were up 42 from 2007 the decreases for 2009 resulted mainly from reduced variable pay and staff reductions the increases for 2008 resulted mainly from merit pay salary increases offset by reductions in variable pay the salary costs for 2009 also included sharebased compensation expense of approximately 298 million down from 318 million for 2008 employee health and insurance benefits for 2009 increased 379 from 2008 which decreased 105 from 2007 employee health and insurance expense for 2009 increased mainly due to higher health care costs from catastrophic claims employee health and insurance expense for 2008 included an adjustment which reduced expense by approximately 30 million to reflect the elimination of a health insurance benefit retirement expense for 2009 increased primarily due to pension expenses retirement expense for 2008 decreased primarily because no accrual was required for the company’s profit sharing plan salaries and employee benefits are shown in greater detail in schedule 12 

  

schedule 12 

salaries and employee benefits 

 

 other real estate expense increased to 1108 million compared 504 million for 2008 and 44 million for 2007 the increase is primarily due to increased oreo balances and writedowns resulting from declining property values mainly in utah and nevada 

legal and professional services decreased 83 million or 182 compared to 2008 which was up 39 from 2007 the decrease in 2009 was primarily driven by a reduction in the use of technology related consultants and professional services 

postage and supplies expense decreased 55 million or 147 compared to 2008 which was up 27 from 2007 the decrease in 2009 was primarily driven by cost reduction measures implemented by the company 

fdic premiums for 2009 increased 806 million or 4050 compared to 2008 which was up 2062 from 2007 due to increased premium rates and a “onetime” special assessment charged by the fdic we expect this expense to remain elevated in 2010 

the provision for unfunded lending commitments was 655 million for 2009 compared to 14 million for 2008 see “provisions for credit losses” on page 57 for further discussion 

other noninterest expense for 2009 increased 83 million or 36 compared to 2008 which was down 19 from 2007 the increase in 2009 was primarily due to increased creditrelated expenses of 209 million offset by reductions in travel expense other operational losses and scanner equipment expense during 2008 the company reduced the visa litigation accrual by 56 million as a result of visa funding a litigation escrow account and settling certain covered litigation 

impairment losses on goodwill 

during 2009 goodwill impairment analysis completed in the first and fourth quarters resulted in total impairment losses on goodwill of 6362 million almost entirely at amegy the annual goodwill impairment analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in total impairment losses on goodwill of 3538 million at the nba vectra nsb and p5 reporting units 

the primary causes of the impairment losses on goodwill in 2009 and 2008 at the company’s banking reporting units were declines in market values of comparable companies and reduced earnings at the reporting units which resulted primarily from deterioration in credit quality of loan portfolios see “accounting for goodwill” on page 45 for further discussion of the goodwill impairment 

  

foreign operations 

six of our subsidiary banks each operate a foreign branch in grand cayman grand cayman islands bwi the branches only accept deposits from qualified domestic customers while deposits in these branches are not subject to frb reserve requirements or fdic insurance premiums there are no federal or state income tax benefits to the company or any customers as a result of these operations 

foreign deposits at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 totaled 17 billion 26 billion and 34 billion respectively and averaged 20 billion for 2009 32 billion for 2008 and 27 billion for 2007 all of these foreign deposits were related to domestic customers of the banks see schedule 35 on page 100 for foreign loans outstanding 

income taxes 

the company’s income tax benefit for 2009 was 4013 million compared to an income tax benefit of 434 million for 2008 and income tax expense of 2357 million for 2007 the company’s effective income tax rates including the effects of noncontrolling interests were 248 in 2009 140 in 2008 and 323 in 2007 the 2009 average effective tax rate was higher than in 2008 primarily due to the smaller impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in proportion to overall net taxable loss see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes 

the average effective tax rate in 2008 was lower than in 2007 mainly because of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charges increased securities impairment charges loan loss provision and oreo chargedowns recorded in 2008 also affected taxable loss thereby increasing the impact of nontaxable income relative to total loss during 2008 the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 96 million net of any federal andor state tax benefits of this reduction 52 million decreased the company’s tax expense for 2008 and 44 million reduced taxrelated balance sheet accounts 

in 2004 the company signed an agreement that confirmed and implemented its award of a 100 million allocation of tax credit authority under the community development financial institutions fund set up by the us government under the program zions has invested 100 million as of december 31 2009 in a whollyowned subsidiary which makes qualifying loans and investments in return zions receives federal income tax credits that will be recognized over seven years including the year in which the funds were invested in the subsidiary income tax expense was reduced by 59 million for 2009 58 million for 2008 and 56 million for 2007 as a result of these tax credits we expect that we will be able to reduce the company’s federal income tax payments by a total of 39 million over the life of this award which is expected to run from 2004 through 2013

 amegy had a net loss of 7804 million for 2009 compared to net income of 1251 million for 2008 and net income of 944 million for 2007 the net loss for the year was primarily due to a 6333 million impairment loss on goodwill taken in the first quarter of 2009 along with a 4648 increase in the provision for loan losses the impairment loss on goodwill was primarily due to declines in market values of comparable companies and the lower shortterm earnings potential of amegy itself the increase in the provision for loan losses was due to deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio as a result of the difficult economic environment 

nonperforming assets were 5495 million at december 31 2009 compared to 567 million one year ago an increase of 4928 million or 8691 the increase in nonperforming assets primarily was due to deterioration in the construction and land development segment of the loan portfolio nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2009 was 652 compared to 062 at december 31 2008 

net loan and lease chargeoffs were 1432 million for 2009 compared with 241 million for 2008 and 90 million for 2007 net loan and lease chargeoffs in 2009 were primarily in the construction and land development loan portfolio the loan loss provision was 4061 million for 2009 compared to 719 million for 2008 and 212 million for 2007 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases was 458 at december 31 2009 compared to 128 and 087 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively

other noninterest income decreased 294 to 1361 million compared to 1929 million for 2008 and 1267 million for 2007 the largest decreases in noninterest income were a 255 million or 656 decline in

million in commercial real estate term loans the reduction in loan portfolio balances was due to the soft economy commercial borrowers deleveraging and to soft real estate markets amegy continues to be active in new loan originations by seeking borrowers meeting both its pricing and credit criteria 

total deposits grew 255 million or 30 in 2009 compared to 2008 with noninterestbearing demand deposits growing 1034 million and total interestbearing deposits shrinking 779 million the ratio of noninterestbearing demand deposits to total deposits was 422 in 2009 and 314 in 2008 amegy continues to be a leader in providing treasury management services to commercial clients and in serving retail and small business enterprises through its branch network

the total riskbased capital ratio at december 31 2009 was 1357 compared to 1113 and 1094 at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively the increase in total riskbased capital was due to 177 million in direct capital injections from the parent and the issuance of qualifying tier 1 capital preferred stock of 296 million to the parent offset by the redemption of 231 million of subordinated debt which qualified as tier 2 capital due to the parent and the net loss of 1480 million excluding the aftertax goodwill impairment 

national bank of arizona 

national bank of arizona is headquartered in tucson arizona and is the 4 th largest fullservice commercial bank in arizona as measured by domestic deposits in the state nba operates 76 fullservice traditional branches 

the arizona economy began its contraction in late 2007 prior to much of the same trend being realized at the national level in a twentyfour month period beginning with the third quarter of 2007 the state workforce declined by more than 10 or 275000 nonfarm workers the current pace of job loss has dissipated to roughly half of the average experienced during this 24 month period however continued job losses are expected until the third quarter of 2010 total unemployment was at 88 at the end of 2009 and is expected to improve to 77 by the end of 2010 the state’s population grew at an historically low rate of 11 or approximately 70000 in 2009 and is expected to again increase at this slow pace in 2010 residential homebuilding activity as measured by new permits decreased by 45 to 13689 in 2009 compared to 2008 although the reduction was significant for the full year by midyear 2009 the trend began to reflect some level of improvement this slightly more positive trend is expected to continue into 2010 with a projected increase of 42 to just over 19000 new residential permits commercial real estate values have declined significantly since their peak in late 2007 any recovery in commercial values is expected to lag behind expected residential improvement in 2010

 the net loss for nba decreased 340 to 1442 million for 2009 compared to a loss of 2186 million for 2008 and net income of 678 million for 2007 in 2008 nba recognized an impairment loss on the entire balance of goodwill totaling 1686 million excluding the after tax goodwill impairment loss in 2008 the net loss for 2009 compared to 2008 increased 800 million the increased loss is mainly due to the decline in net interest income and the increased provision for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses increased during the year as loan credit quality worsened through 2009 loan credit quality did appear to begin stabilizing in midyear and to improve somewhat thereafter this credit quality improvement was not due to improvement in the arizona economy but rather was primarily due to the fact that many problem loans had been chargeddown or otherwise resolved nonperforming assets were 3202 million at the end of 2009 compared to 2730 million at the end of 2008 the level of nonperforming assets although higher when comparing the end of 2009 with 2008 has declined from the peak experienced in mid2009 the majority of the nonperforming loans are construction and land development loans and mortgages nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2009 was 866 compared to 649 at december 31 2008 

net loan and lease chargeoffs were 2142 million for 2009 an increase of 670 million from the 1472 million level experienced in 2008 net loan and lease chargeoffs were primarily related to the bank’s real estate portfolio including construction and land development loans and mortgages the provision for loan losses was 2917 million for 2009 compared to 2118 million for 2008 and 305 million for 2007 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases was 557 and 301 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

net interest income at nba for 2009 decreased 404 million or 184 compared to 2008 a reduction in average earning assets of 203 million from 2008 to 2009 coupled with an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and competitive pressure on deposit pricing contributed to the decrease in net interest 

  

income for the year the net interest margin was 395 for 2009 compared to 464 for 2008 and 508 for 2007 comparatively low margins during 2009 were largely due to the level and severity of nonperforming assets and lower yields achieved on higher levels of liquidity maintained throughout the year 

noninterest income decreased 60 to 440 million compared to 468 million for 2008 and 334 million for 2007 the majority of the decrease is attributable to a 24 million decline in fair value and nonhedge derivative income during 2009 

noninterest expense for 2009 increased by 88 million or 55 from 2008 increases for 2009 include a 61 million or 2008 increase in fdic premiums from 2008 and a 32 million or 733 increase in credit related costs credit related and oreo costs totaled 367 million for all of 2009 and are a result of continued declines in the value of foreclosed properties several noninterest expense components such as salaries and benefits declined year over year as management worked to reduce controllable operating expenses the efficiency ratio was 7612 for 2009 compared to 6045 for 2008 and 4990 for 2007 the change in efficiency ratio was due to the heightened level of credit related expenditures and fdic premiums coupled with the overall reduction in net interest income

net loans and leases contracted 499 million in 2009 or a 121 decline when compared to 2008 at the end of 2009 commercial real estate loans were down 284 million or 174 and the commercial lending portfolio had decreased 162 million or 120 when compared to the 2008 yearend balance the contraction in these categories was a direct result of nba’s focus on reducing its exposure to real estate related transactions and timely handling of troubled assets this downward trend in exposure to commercial real estate loans is expected to continue in 2010 however the pace of decline will likely slow commercial lending activity is expected to increase during 2010 as nba anticipates expanding its banking business 

total deposits decreased 139 million or 35 in 2009 compared to 2008 as the bank worked to reduce balances in higher cost deposit categories the ratio of noninterestbearing demand deposits to total deposits was 275 in 2009 and 233 in 2008 brokered deposit levels declined by the end of 2009 to 33 million as compared to 128 million at december 31 2008 

the bank continued to be well capitalized in 2009 its total riskbased capital ratio was 1576 at december 31 2009 1876 at 2008 and 1095 at 2007 the decrease in the ratio from 2008 to 2009 was a direct result of the net loss sustained during the year and the disallowance of a portion of the net deferred tax assets for purposes of calculating regulatory capital levels 

nevada state bank 

nevada state bank is headquartered in las vegas nevada and is the fifth largest fullservice commercial bank in nevada as measured by domestic deposits in the state nsb operates 54 fullservice traditional branches and 4 banking centers in grocery stores throughout the state of nevada and provides banking services to nevada’s small and midsized businesses as well as retail consumers with a focus on relationship banking 

during 2009 nsb acquired the banking operations of the former great basin bank of elko nevada in an fdicassisted transaction the acquisition consisted of approximately 212 million of assets including the entire loan portfolio 209 million of deposits and five branches in northern nevada nsb received approximately 178 million in cash from the fdic and entered into a loss sharing agreement in which the fdic assumes 80 of the first 40 million of losses on loans and other real estate owned and 95 of any losses above that amount for a period of up to ten years 

the markets in which nsb operates are heavily dependent on traveltourism and construction during spring 2008 financial conditions in these sectors began to deteriorate dramatically this deterioration continued throughout 2009 but has begun to moderate and in certain metrics there has been stabilization and slight improvement as of october 2009 and compared to october 2008 gaming revenues are down 116 airline passenger count is down 03 and visitor volume is up 07 from november 2008 to november 2009 in clark county nsb’s biggest market area residential construction permits increased 10 after falling 877 in the prior year while commercial construction permits fell 714 after declining 550 in the prior year washoe county saw residential permits fall 250 in 2009 after a decline of 574 in 2008 commercial construction permits declined 579 compared to 529 in 2008 these declines have led to an increase in the nevada unemployment rate to 128 at december 2009 compared to 87 one year earlier the consensus outlook for 2010 is that nevada’s economy will remain challenged as residential foreclosures continue construction remains suppressed and consumers remain conservative in their spending habits despite a slight increase in expected visitor volume

 the net loss for nsb increased 6686 to 3520 million for 2009 compared to 458 million for 2008 and net income of 524 million for 2007 the increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses of 4634 million net interest income declined 190 million as loan volumes declined and higher yielding loans were replaced with low yielding federal funds sold expenses and losses related to other real estate owned increased 200 million offset by a 165 million gain related to the great basin bank acquisition 

nonperforming assets excluding fdicsupported assets were 3195 million at december 31 2009 compared to 2220 million one year ago an increase of 975 million or 439 the majority of the increase is due to deterioration in commercial real estate term loans while the remaining increase is generally attributable to deterioration of construction and land development loans nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2009 was 1178 compared to 685 at december 31 2008 

net loan and lease chargeoffs were 3664 million for 2009 compared with 716 million for 2008 and 27 million for 2007 approximately 62 of net loan and lease chargeoffs in 2009 related to construction and land development loans the majority of the remaining net losses were investorowned commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans the provision for loan losses was 5637 million for 2009 compared to 1003 million for 2008 and 233 million for 2007 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases excluding fdicsupported loans was 1053 and 258 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

net interest income at nsb declined 119 or 190 million from 2008 to 2009 this decrease resulted from a shift in earning assets from generally higheryielding loans into loweryielding federal funds sold combined with a lower interest rate environment the yield on earning assets declined 287 from 647 in 

  

2008 to 461 in 2009 which was the primary driver of the reduced net interest income in 2009 the shift in earning assets was driven by a lack of quality loan demand in the markets in which we do business combined with the high level of chargeoffs incurred during the year loans declined from 892 of average earning assets in 2008 to 769 in 2009 and federal funds sold increased from 07 of average earning assets in 2008 to 150 in 2009 further lower interest rate levels in 2009 resulted in much of the loan portfolio being repriced at rates below those earned in 2008 finally higher levels of nonperforming loans lowered the yield on earning assets in 2009 the cost of interestbearing deposits also declined offsetting some of the decline in interest income the lower interest rate environment and the strong core deposit base led to a decline in the cost of interestbearing deposits from 267 in 2008 to 171 in 2009 the result of these changes in the balance sheet mix and the lower interest rate environment produced a net interest margin of 350 for 2009 compared to 443 for 2008 and 506 for 2007 

other noninterest income increased 421 to 608 million compared to 428 million for 2008 and 329 million for 2007 a 165 million gain on the acquisition of great basin bank was recognized in 2009 while no such gains were recognized in 2008 or 2007 gains related to terminated interest rate swaps and hedge ineffectiveness on outstanding cash flow hedging relationships totaled 271 million 78 million and 06 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively other noninterest income components were generally flat from 2007 through 2009 with increases in deposit service charges offset by lower loan fees and dividends on restricted stock the bank also recognized net impairment losses on investment securities of 33 million in 2009 compared to 20 million in 2008 

noninterest expense for 2009 increased 427 million or 310 from 2008 increases for 2009 included a 200 million or 1694 increase in expenses and realized losses related to other real estate owned a 125 million or 8166 increase in the provision for unfunded lending commitments and a 64 million or 2316 increase in fdic insurance premiums attributable to a “onetime” assessment required by the fdic in 2009 as well as higher assessment rates experienced throughout the banking industry recurring expenses such as salaries and benefits and occupancy experienced modest declines from 2008 to 2009 as savings from the closing of 28 grocery store center branches in early 2009 were largely offset by increased costs related to the addition of the great basin bank operations the efficiency ratio was 8914 for 2009 as compared to 6896 for 2008 and 5182 for 2007 the increase in the efficiency ratio from 2008 to 2009 was driven by the higher other real estate owned expenses unfunded commitment provisions and fdic assessments discussed above while total revenue remained essentially flat the bank incurred a goodwill impairment loss of 210 million during 2008 with no such losses incurred in 2009 no goodwill remains on the balance sheet of nevada state bank

nevada state bank 

 

 net loans and leases contracted 448 million or 140 in 2009 compared to 2008 gross chargeoffs were a major driver of the contraction accounting for 381 million or 850 of the decline a general lack of quality loan demand accounts for the remainder as nevada experienced economic contraction throughout 2009 construction and land development and other real estate secured loans experienced the largest decline again driven by chargeoffs but also due to management’s efforts to reduce concentrations in this area loan demand is expected to remain challenged in 2010 as difficult economic conditions persist and nsb’s focus remains on growing the commercial and small business loan portfolios and managing the runoff of real estate loans 

total deposits increased 12 million or 03 in 2009 compared to 2008 the deposit mix improved with the ratio of noninterestbearing demand deposits to total deposits increasing to 326 in 2009 from 260 in 2008 certificates of deposit declined from 326 of total deposits in 2008 to 185 in 2009 as nsb focused on growing core deposit relationships and reducing reliance on nonrelationship rate sensitive funds deposit growth is expected to be relatively flat in 2010 as an incrementally improving economy and potentially higher market interest rates may lead to the deployment of some depositor funds into higher yielding assets nsb has no brokered certificates of deposit or internet money market accounts 

  

total securities increased 135 million or 696 in 2009 compared to 2008 as nevada state bank purchased us government and government sponsored enterprise guaranteed obligations as part of its balance sheet management strategy 

the bank continued to be well capitalized in 2009 its total riskbased capital ratio was 2007 at yearend 2009 1558 at 2008 and 1105 at 2007 the increase in the ratio was impacted by capital contributions of 500 million of preferred and common equity from the parent partially offset by the net loss of 3520 million and a reduction in riskweighted assets as loans declined and federal funds sold increased

the net loss for vectra decreased 810 to 256 million for 2009 compared to a net loss of 1350 million for 2008 and net income of 222 million for 2007 the 2008 loss was driven by a 1515 million impairment loss on goodwill which eliminated the full amount of goodwill at vectra in 2009 the primary driver of the loss was the increase in provision for loan losses of 626 million over 2008 levels 

during 2009 the bank experienced a decline in credit quality attributable to the recession’s impact on the colorado economy vectra expects to see some stabilization in credit quality trends during 2010 nonperforming lendingrelated assets were 1059 million at december 31 2009 compared to 251 million one year ago an increase of 808 million or 3219 nearly all of the increase in nonperforming assets relates to the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2009 was 529 compared to 121 at december 31 2008

net interest income at vectra for 2009 increased 17 million or 16 this increase primarily resulted from a decrease in interest expense as the bank reduced both its deposit rates and its average wholesale funding position by 304 million while growing its lower cost deposit base by 200 million over average 2008 levels some of the benefit of the lower funding cost was offset by a reduction in earning assets of 51 million and a decline in the yield on average interest earning assets of 074 the yield on earning assets primarily reflects the declining rate environment throughout 2008 the net interest margin was 452 for 2009 compared to 431 for 2008 and 453 for 2007 the margin increased as the bank restructured its funding base to reduce interest expense

 net income for tcbw decreased 886 to 16 million for 2009 compared to 140 million for 2008 and 154 million for 2007 the decrease in net income was primarily due to a 214 million increase in provision for loan losses 

  

nonperforming assets were 295 million at december 31 2009 compared to no nonperforming assets at december 31 2008 nearly all of the increase is attributable to deterioration in commercial and industrial loans nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2009 was 509

other noninterest income increased 1136 to 94 million compared to 44 million for 2008 and 25 million for 2007 the primary increase in other noninterest income was 50 million of increased revenues related to terminated interest rate swap hedge transactions this revenue which would normally amortize over the original term of the swap was accelerated due to a decline in the number of floating loans available for the hedge other factors included an increase of 377 in service charge fees on deposit accounts 

noninterest expense for 2009 increased 11 million or 74 from 2008 the largest factor in this increase was 14 million in fdic premiums compared to 04 million in 2008 an increase of 2611 increases for 2009 also include a 01 million or 15 increase in salaries and benefits the efficiency ratio was 3907 for 2009 as compared to 3952 for 2008 and 3768 for 2007

 net loans and leases contracted 10 million or 17 in 2009 compared to 2008 the decline was primarily due to 153 million in chargeoffs and a decline in credit line utilization in the fourth quarter offset by increases in commercial and industrial loans and loans to high net worth individuals yearly average net loans and leases increased by 34 million or 61 from 2008 to 2009 the allowance for loan and lease losses increased to 13 million in 2009 from 6 million in 2008 reflective of portfolio deterioration tcbw continues to focus on loan growth in the commercial and high net worth individual markets and anticipates opportunities to grow market share in these areas as weaker local community banks struggle to maintain their client base 

total deposits increased 29 million or 48 in 2009 compared to 2008 the ratio of noninterestbearing demand deposits to total deposits was 310 in 2009 and 307 2008 tcbw does not maintain brokered deposits and does not offer internet special rates 

the bank continued to be well capitalized in 2009 its total riskbased capital ratio was 1386 at 2009 yearend 1332 at 2008 and 1346 at 2007

“other” includes the parent and various nonbanking subsidiaries including nonbank financial services and financial technology subsidiaries and other smaller nonbank operating units along with the elimination of transactions between segments 

  

the other segment also includes zions management services company “zmsc” which provides internal technology and operational services to affiliated operating businesses of the company zmsc has 2214 of the 2483 fte employees in the other segment zmsc charges most of its costs to the affiliates on an approximate breakeven basis 

the other segment also includes the commerce bank of oregon “tcbo” which was opened during the fourth quarter of 2005 and has not had a significant impact on the company’s balance sheet and income statement tcbo consists of a single banking office operating in the portland oregon area its business strategies focus on serving the financial needs of businesses professional service firms executives and professionals at december 31 2009 tcbo had net loans of 53 million compared to 46 million at the end of 2008 and deposits of 47 million compared to 35 million at the end of 2008

 net earnings applicable to common shareholders for the other segment was 3219 million in 2009 compared to net losses of 1757 million in 2008 and 340 million in 2007 the increase in net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2009 is mainly due to the gain on subordinated debt modification and the impact of eliminating intercompany transactions offset by increased net impairment losses on investment securities increased preferred stock dividends mainly related to the us treasury’s 14 billion preferred stock investment and reduced net interest income the increased net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2008 is mainly due to increased impairment losses on investment securities goodwill impairment losses on p5 goodwill intercompany hedge ineffectiveness eliminations and increased preferred stock dividends mainly related to the us treasury’s 14 billion preferred stock investment net impairment and valuation losses on 

  

investment securities increased to a total of 2054 million in 2009 from 969 million for 2008 mainly due to impairment losses on bank and insurance trust preferred cdo securities see “capital management” on page 126 for an explanation of preferred stock dividends 

net interest income was 1004 million in 2009 compared to 88 million in 2008 and 08 million in 2007 the decrease in 2009 in net interest income is primarily due to the amortization of the discount on the modified convertible subordinated debt and interest expense on senior notes issued in 2009 at a higher interest rate the modified convertible subordinated debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method the rate of amortization will be accelerated if and as holders of the convertible subordinated debt elect to convert it into preferred stock see further discussion in “net interest income margin and interest rate spreads” on page 52 

other noninterest income was 152 million in 2009 compared to 989 million in 2008 and 228 million in 2007 the increase in other noninterest income is mainly due to an elimination in 2008 of 793 million for income recognized by the subsidiary banks on ineffective hedges that were not ineffective for the consolidated company and a 95 million decrease in net equity securities losses 

the decline in 2008 in other noninterest income is mainly due to 596 million in hedge ineffectiveness income eliminations in 2008 for ineffective hedges at the subsidiary banks that were not ineffective for the consolidated company other reasons for the decrease include 154 million for intercompany derivative credit valuation income eliminations 302 million for declines in net equity securities gains 42 million for declines in net fixed income securities gains a 71 million fair value decrease for a security accounted for at fair value and 77 million for declines in income from other equity investments 

the company selectively makes investments in financial services and financial technology ventures the company owns a significant position in identrust inc “identrust” a company in which two unrelated venture capital firms also own significant positions and which provides among other services online identity authentication services and infrastructure identrust continues to post operating losses and the company recorded pretax charges of 09 million in 2009 and 17 million in 2008 and 22 million in 2007 which reduced our recorded investment in the company 

the company continues to selectively invest in new innovative products and ventures most notably the company has funded the continued development of netdeposit formerly netdeposit inc and p5 netdeposit losses included in the other segment were 120 million for 2009 compared to losses of 181 million in 2008 and 83 million in 2007 excluding the goodwill impairment loss of 127 million the net loss for 2008 was 54 million 

  

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those assets with interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum 

interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities and loans and leases schedule 7 which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of the company’s interestearning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields as shown in the schedule average interestearning assets in 2009 increased 23 to 488 billion from 477 billion in 2008 mainly driven by increased average loans average interestearning assets comprised 902 of total average assets in 2009 compared with 887 in 2008 average interestearning assets were 925 of average tangible assets in 2009 as compared to 923 in 2008 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits and commercial paper federal funds sold and security resell agreements increased 260 in 2009 to 2380 million from 1889 million in 2008 the increase in average money market investments reflects the increase in the company’s liquidity during 2009 average commercial paper purchased from lockhart was 118 million for 2009 compared to 865 million for 2008 average investment securities decreased 36 for 2009 compared to 2008 average net loans and leases for 2009 increased 18 compared to 2008 primarily due to the impact of the acquired loans with fdic support 

investment securities portfolio 

we invest in securities both to generate revenues for the company and to manage liquidity schedules 28 and 29 present a profile of the company’s investment portfolios at december 31 2009 with assetbacked securities classified by credit ratings schedule 30 presents a summarized profile of the company’s investment portfolios at december 31 2009 and 2008 the amortized cost amounts represent the company’s original cost for the investments adjusted for accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments related to the security and credit impairment losses the estimated fair values are the amounts that we believe most accurately reflect assumptions that other participants in the market place would use in pricing the securities as of the dates indicated 

schedule 28 presents the company’s assetbacked securities classified by the highest of the ratings from any of moody’s investors service fitch ratings or standard  poors schedule 29 presents the assetbacked securities classified by the lowest of the ratings from any of these ratings agencies during 2009 the company continued to observe divergence of ratings on these securities between the various rating agencies

 the amortized cost of investment securities at december 31 2009 increased 87 from the balance at december 31 2008 the change was largely due to zions bank purchasing securities from lockhart 678 million the company purchasing auction rate securities from customers 237 million securities acquired in the fdicassisted transactions of the failed alliance great basin and vineyard banks 182 million and the impact of the 2009 provisions of acs 320 230 million offset by otti credit impairment valuation losses on security purchases and security maturity paydowns see further discussion of securities purchased from lockhart in “termination of offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 103 as discussed further in “market risk – fixed income” on page 120 changes in fair value on availableforsale securities have been reflected in shareholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income “oci” 

as shown previously at december 31 2009 104 of the 37 billion of fair value of availableforsale securities portfolio was valued at level 1 439 was valued at level 2 and 457 was valued at level 3 under the gaap fair value accounting valuation hierarchy see “fair value accounting” on page 35 and note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value accounting 

the amortized cost of availableforsale investment securities valued at level 3 was 2413 million and the fair value of these securities was 1670 million the securities valued at level 3 were comprised of abs cdos and auction rate securities for these level 3 securities net pretax unrealized loss recognized in oci at year end was 743 million as of december 31 2009 we believe that the par amounts of the level 3 availableforsale 

  

securities for which no otti has been recognized do not differ from the amounts we currently anticipate realizing on settlement or maturity see “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 35 for further details about the cdo securities pricing methodologies 

during 2009 the company reassessed the classification of certain assetbacked and trust preferred cdos and reclassified approximately 596 million at fair value of heldtomaturity securities to availableforsale these securities were downgraded from an investment grade to a noninvestment grade rating by at least one rating agency no gain or loss was recognized in the statement of income at the time of reclassification 

we review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of otti taking into consideration current market conditions estimated credit impairment if any fair value in relationship to cost the extent and nature of change in fair value issuer rating changes and trends volatility of earnings current analysts’ evaluations our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value which may be maturity and other factors the company incurred 2805 million of creditrelated otti charges recorded in earnings and 2894 million pretax of otti related to illiquidity recorded in oci during 2009 the collateral in these securities deemed to have otti includes bank and insurance trust preferred debt commercial mortgagebacked securities and debt issued by commercial income reits residential mortgage reits and homebuilders future reviews for otti will consider the particular facts and circumstances during the reporting period in review see “otherthantemporary impairment – debt investment securities” on page 42 for further details about the otti accounting policy 

the company recognized valuation losses during 2009 of 1879 million on securities purchased from lockhart under the terms of lockhart’s liquidity agreement and 242 million on auction rate securities purchased from bank customers at par during 2008 the company recognized valuation losses of 131 million on securities purchased from lockhart these securities purchased from lockhart in 2009 and 2008 consisted of reit cdos and bank and insurance trust preferred cdos see “termination of offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 103 for further details about lockhart 

schedules 31 and 32 provide additional information on the belowinvestmentgrade rated bank and insurance trust preferred cdos portion of the afs and htm portfolio with aggregate data on those securities which have been determined to not have otti at december 31 2009 and those which have been determined to be otti at or prior to december 31 2009 the schedules utilize the lowest rating to identify those securities below investment grade the schedules segment the securities by original ratings level to provide granularity on the seniority level of the securities and the distribution of unrealized losses and on poollevel performance and projections the best and worst poollevel statistic for each original ratings subgroup is presented not the best and worst single security within the original ratings grouping the number of issuers and number of currently performing issuers noted in schedule 32 are from the same security the remaining statistics may not be from the same security 

the company’s loss and recovery experience as of december 31 2009 is 100 loss on defaults our experience with deferring collateral has been that of all collateral that has elected to defer beginning in 2007 47 has defaulted and 53 remains within the allowable deferrable period

during the fourth quarter of 2009 the company was informed of outstanding offers from a hedge fund to the preferred shareholders “equity holders” of four cdos in which the company held senior debt the offers sought to induce the equity holders in exchange for payments to be made outside of the cdo to approve sales to the hedge fund of substantial amounts of performing collateral at deeply discounted prices such sales if consummated would be detrimental to the interests of the more senior tranches of the cdo 

three of the four offers were not accepted by preferred shareholders and the offer with respect to one cdo was accepted by the preferred shareholders the trustee has not commenced to sell the collateral and has filed an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking that the court order the interested parties in all the cdos to interplead and settle all claims relating to the collateral the company and numerous other holders of more senior tranches of this cdo have retained counsel to defend their interests in the cdos and the collateral and to seek to block any such sales and believe they have substantial legal bases to do so 

the company had holdings with a carrying value and amortized cost of 66 million and 335 million respectively at december 31 2009 related to the cdo with the accepted offer the company’s investment could be materially adversely affected if judicial determinations result in the sale of the performing collateral at significant discounts to fair value the company has not adjusted the cash flows of these securities or incorporated the risk of an adverse outcome into its otti analysis as a result of the actions described above the company does not expect that the ultimate judicial determination will permit the proposed sales which are in contravention to the seniority concepts within the cdos we did not find that sufficient information was available to market participants at either the balance sheet date or filing date to support the expectation of an adverse outcome schedule 33 also presents information regarding the investment securities portfolio this schedule presents the maturities of the different types of investments that the company owned as of december 31 2009 and the corresponding average interest rates that the investments will yield if they are held to maturity it should be noted that most of the sba loanbacked securities and assetbacked securities are variable rate and their repricing periods are significantly less than their contractual maturities also see “liquidity risk” on page 121 and notes 1 4 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s investment securities and their management

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2009 net loans and leases accounted for 786 of total assets compared to 756 at yearend 2008 and 804 of tangible assets as compared to 781 at december 31 2008 schedule 35 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2009 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in certain cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 117 

schedule 35 

loan portfolio by type and maturity 

 

  

during 2008 the company completed a loan classification project information to reclassify loans for periods prior to 2007 is not available 

net loans and leases decreased 15 billion during 2009 compared to an increase of 28 billion during 2008 loans at december 31 2009 include 14 billion of loans acquired from the fdic with loss sharing agreements related to the failed alliance bank great basin bank and vineyard bank excluding these fdicsupported loans net loans and leases decreased approximately 29 billion or 70 during 2009 throughout our markets due to weak loan demand as well as payoffs and loan chargeoffs resulting from challenging economic 

  

conditions in our markets loan contraction during 2009 was primarily in commercial construction and land development at all banking subsidiaries and secondarily in commercial lending we did have loan growth in the commercial real estate term category at all banking subsidiaries except nsb as maturing creditworthy commercial construction and land development loans converted into commercial real estate term loans the increase in loans in 2008 includes 12 billion of loans resulting from the purchase of certain securities from lockhart as discussed in “termination of offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 103 these securities were backed by loans originated or underwritten by zions bank and are reflected on the company’s balance sheet primarily as owneroccupied commercial loans 

although we continue to actively originate loans we expect that core loan balances for the next few quarters will most likely contract this is mainly due to the current economic environment which is causing a reduction in loan demand paydowns charge offs and other reductions are likely to continue to offset originations we expect construction and land development balances to continue to decline as they have during recent quarters 

sold loans being serviced 

the company performs loan servicing operations on both loans that it holds in its portfolios as well as loans that are owned by third parties servicing loans includes 

 

  

  

  

 the company receives a fee for performing loan servicing for third parties failure by the company to service the loans in accordance with the contractual requirements of the servicing agreements may lead to the termination of the servicing contract and the loss of future servicing fees 

schedule 36 

sold loans being serviced 

 

 the increase in outstanding sba 7a sold loans being serviced is primarily due to the impact of acquired sba 7a loan servicing portfolios at alliance and vineyard banks 

other earning assets 

as of december 31 2009 the company had 1100 million of other noninterestbearing investments compared with 1044 million in 2008 the increase in other noninterestbearing investments resulted mainly from increases in federal reserve stock 

  

schedule 37 

other noninterestbearing investments 

 

  

 federal reserve stock investments increased 38 million during 2009 due to regulatory required investments 

nonsbic investment funds increased 9 million during 2009 primarily as a result of increased investment in funds within new and existing investment commitments and appreciation on investments 

other public company investments increased 10 million during 2009 primarily due to increased equity in earnings from investments in farmer mac and life quotes inc 

deposits and borrowed funds 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company during 2009 total actual and average deposit balances increased over 2008 balances and were impacted by the inclusion of deposits related to failed bank fdicassisted acquisitions and a failed bank fdic paying agent agreement total deposits exceeded the company’s net loans and leases balance at december 31 2009 

schedule 7 on page 54 summarizes average deposit balances for the past five years along with their respective interest costs and average interest rates average noninterestbearing deposits increased 209 in 2009 from 2008 while average interestbearing deposits increased 118 during the same time period average noninterestbearing deposit account balance growth was strong in 2009 and the company believes this is partially attributable to low absolute interest rates and the fdic guarantee on demand deposits 

total deposits at december 31 2009 increased 05 billion to 418 billion or 13 over the balances reported at december 31 2008 noninterestbearing demand deposits at december 31 2009 increased 26 billion to 123 billion compared to 97 billion at december 31 2008 demand savings and money market deposits comprised 826 of total deposits at december 31 2009 compared with 749 as of december 31 2008 the increase was mainly driven by increased noninterestbearing demand deposits and savings deposits during 2009 

during 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 the company increased brokered deposit programs and internet money market accounts to serve as an additional source of liquidity for the company and to reduce its reliance on fhlb advances and other shortterm borrowings as liquidity returned to the market during 2009 the company reduced brokered deposit programs at december 31 2009 total deposits included 16 billion of 

  

brokered deposits compared to 33 billion at december 31 2008 internet money market deposits were 27 billion compared to 25 billion at december 31 2008 money market deposits included 13 billion of brokered deposits or 77 of total money market deposits the average balance of brokered deposits was 29 billion for 2009 and 653 million for 2008 

see “liquidity risk” on page 121 for information on funding and borrowed funds also see notes 11 12 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on borrowed funds 

termination of offbalance sheet arrangement 

the company previously administered a qualifying specialpurpose entity “qspe” securities conduit lockhart funding llc which was established in 2000 lockhart was structured to purchase aaarated and other government agency securities and aaarated securities that were collateralized by small business loans originated or purchased by zions bank such loans were originated during and prior to 2005 lockhart obtained funding through the issuance of assetbacked commercial paper 

lockhart ceased issuance of asset backed commercial paper on april 21 2009 after moody’s downgraded zions bank as liquidity bank from p1 to np and downgraded lockhart as a consequence effective june 5 2009 zions bank became a holder of over 90 of lockhart’s commercial paper notes causing lockhart to no longer be a qspe and thus requiring consolidation of lockhart by zions bank at fair value 

on september 15 2009 the remaining outstanding commercial paper notes of lockhart totaling 3 million matured lockhart’s remaining security portfolio was exclusively sbabacked securities following the notes’ maturity on september 15 2009 lockhart and its program documents were terminated as agreed to in an executed termination agreement dated may 29 2009 between all involved parties 

under the terms of a liquidity facility prior to lockhart’s consolidation zions bank purchased during the nine months ended september 30 2009 678 million of securities from lockhart at book value and recognized losses of 1879 million in marking the securities to fair value 

see “liquidity management actions” on page 123 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on lockhart 

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is integral to those operations and is also a key determinant of the company’s overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower or contractual counterparty to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through a uniform credit policy credit administration and credit exam functions at the parent effective management of credit risk is essential in maintaining a safe sound and profitable financial institution we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio further an independent internal credit examination department periodically 

  

conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to management and to the credit review committee of the board of directors new expanded or modified products and services as well as new lines of business are approved by a new product review committee at the bank level or parent level depending on the inherent risk of the new activity 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each bank is able to modify corporate credit policy to be more conservative however corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to create a more liberal policy historically only a limited number of such modifications have been approved this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

with regard to credit risk associated with counterparties in offbalance sheet credit instruments zions bank and amegy have international swap dealer association “isda” agreements in place under which derivative transactions are entered into with major derivative dealers each isda agreement details the collateral arrangements between zions bank and amegy and their counterparties in every case the amount of the collateral required to secure the exposed party in the derivative transaction is determined by the fair value of the derivative and the credit rating of the party with the obligation the credit rating used in these situations is provided by either moody’s or standard  poor’s this means that a counterparty with a “aaa” rating would be obligated to provide less collateral to secure a major credit exposure than one with an “a” rating all derivative gains and losses between zions bank or amegy and a single counterparty are netted to determine the net credit exposure and therefore the collateral required we have no exposure to credit default swaps 

the company’s credit risk management strategy includes diversification of its loan portfolio the company maintains a diversified loan portfolio with some emphasis in real estate the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular property type or with an individual customer or counterparty during 2009 the company adopted new concentration limits on various types of commercial real estate lending particularly construction and land development lending which over time should reduce further the company’s exposure to this type of lending the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers located within the geographical footprint of its banking subsidiaries see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on concentrations of credit risk 

  

as displayed in schedule 38 at yearend 2009 no single loan type exceeded 246 of the company’s total loan portfolio 

schedule 38 

loan portfolio diversification 

 

 in addition as reflected in schedule 39 as of december 31 2009 the commercial real estate loan portfolio is also well diversified by property type purpose and collateral location 

  

schedule 39 

commercial real estate portfolio by property type and collateral location 

represents percentages based upon outstanding commercial real estate loans 

at december 31 2009 

 

  

 during 2009 the company acquired assets from the fdic as receiver for the failed alliance bank great basin bank and vineyard bank that are included in nonperforming loans and other loans with characteristics indicative of a high credit risk profile these include substantial concentrations in california and nevada loans with homebuilders and other construction finance loans because most of these assets are covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic for which the fdic generally will assume 80 of the first 275 million of credit losses for the alliance bank assets 40 million of credit losses for the great basin bank assets 465 million of credit losses for the vineyard bank assets and 95 of the credit losses in excess of those amounts the company’s financial exposure to losses from these assets is substantially limited fdicsupported loans represent approximately 36 of the company’s total loan portfolio 

the company’s level of credit quality continued to weaken during 2009 although it weakened at a decreasing rate during the fourth quarter of 2009 this deterioration in credit quality is now widespread and affects most of the company’s geographic markets and product types the company believes that a number of indicators of credit quality began to stabilize toward the end of 2009 although further deterioration in the economy could result in further deterioration in credit quality 

loantovalue “ltv” ratios are another key determinant of credit risk in commercial real estate lending the company estimates that the weighted average ltv ratio on the total commercial real estate portfolio at december 31 2009 detailed in yearend amounts in schedule 39 was approximately 586 compared to 574 at december 31 2008 

  

however continued declines in property values in many of our distressed markets may understate the actual current ltv levels this estimate is based on the most current appraisals generally obtained as of the date of origination downgrade or renewal of the loans 

lending to finance residential land acquisition development and construction is a core business for the company in some geographic markets significant declines in the availability of mortgage financing to buyers of newly constructed homes declining home values and general uncertainty in the residential real estate market continue to have an adverse impact on the operations of many of the company’s developer and builder customers 

the company does not pursue subprime residential mortgage lending including option arm and negative amortization loans it does have approximately 475 million of stated income loans with generally high fico scores at origination including “onetime close” loans to finance the construction of a home which convert into permanent jumbo mortgages this portfolio began to show significant credit quality deterioration in the second half of 2008 at december 31 2009 approximately 74 million of the stated income loans had fico scores of less than 620 reflecting the current economic environment these totals exclude heldforsale loans 

the company is engaged in home equity credit line lending we actively monitor our credit risk in this portfolio and as of december 31 2009 approximately 145 of the company’s 21 billion portfolio was estimated to have loantovalue ratios above 100 of the total home equity credit line portfolio 042 was 90 or more days past due at december 31 2009 as compared to 020 as of december 31 2008 the credit losses for this portfolio were 75 basis points for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 during 2009 the company modified 14 million of home equity credit line loans the company requires appraisals for all real estate collateraldependent loans at the time of origination and when adverse credit events occur 

  

commercial real estate loans 

selected information regarding our commercial real estate “cre” loan portfolio is presented in the following schedule 

schedule 40 

commercial real estate portfolio by loan type and collateral location 

at december 31 2009 

  

 

    

approximately 32 of the commercial term loans consist of miniperm loans on which construction is complete and the project is either in the process of stabilization or has stabilized and the owner is waiting to seek permanent financing miniperm loans generally have maturities of 3 to 7 years the remaining 68 are term loans with initial maturities generally of 15 to 20 years stabilization criteria differ by product and are dependent on cash flow created by leaseup for office industrial and retail products and occupancy for retail and apartment products 

approximately 286 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio is designated as acquisition and development most of these acquisition and development properties are tied to specific retail apartment office or other projects underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness of the sponsor the owners’ equity is generally expected to be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is repaid via cash flow the projected economics of the project are primary in the underwriting because this determines the ultimate value of the property and the ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily projects we look for substantial preleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service ratio of 120 

although residential construction and development deals with a different product type many of the requirements previously mentioned such as credit worthiness of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity remargining requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan heavy consideration is given to market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections performed by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made loan agreements generally include limitations on the number of model homes and homes built on a spec basis with preference given to presold homes 

real estate appraisals are ordered independently of the credit officer and the borrower generally by the banks’ appraisal review function which is staffed by certified appraisers in some cases reports from automated valuation services are used appraisals are ordered from outside appraisers at the inception renewal or for cre loans upon the occurrence of any event causing a “criticized” or “classified” grade to be assigned to the credit the frequency for obtaining updated appraisals for these adversely graded credits is increased when declining market conditions exist advance rates on an “as completed basis” will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but corporate guidelines generally limit advances to 5065 for raw land 6575 for land development 6575 for finished commercial lots 7580 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 7580 for models and spec homes and 7580 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of these schedules is closely monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally the frequency of loanbyloan reviews has been increased to a quarterly basis for all commercial and residential construction and land development loans at zions bank california bank  trust amegy national bank of arizona nevada state bank and vectra bank 

interest reserves are established as an expense item in the budget on some real estate construction or development loans we generally require the borrower to put the total amount of available equity into the project at the inception of the construction this enables the bank to maximize the amount of equity obtained and control the amount of money set aside to pay interest on the construction loan the company’s practice is to monitor the construction sales andor leasing progress to determine whether or not the project remains viable at any time during the life of the credit that the project is determined not to be viable the bank discontinues the use of the interest reserve and takes appropriate action to protect its collateral position via negotiation andor legal action as 

  

deemed appropriate at yearend 2009 zions’ affiliates have 416 loans with an outstanding balance of 10 billion where available interest reserves amounted to 106 million in instances where projects have been determined unviable the interest reserves have been frozen 

we have not been involved to any meaningful extent with insurance arrangements credit derivatives or any other default agreements as a mitigation strategy for commercial real estate loans however we do make use of personal or other guarantees as risk mitigation strategies 

the company periodically stress tests its cre loan portfolio this testing is backtested and the results of the testing are reviewed regularly with the management rating agencies and various banking regulators the stress testing methodology includes a loanbyloan monte carlo simulation which is an approach that measures potential loss of principal and related revenues the monte carlo simulation stresses the probability of default and loss given default for cre loans based on a variety of factors including regional economic factors loan grade loantovalue collateral type and geography 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming lending related assets include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection consumer loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is 90 days past due generally closedend nonreal estate secured consumer loans are charged off prior to 120 days past due openend consumer loans adequately secured by real estate are placed on nonaccrual status at 90 days openend credit card consumer loans are charged off when they become 180 days past due nonaccrual loans also include nonperforming loans restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments this generally occurs when the financial condition of a borrower deteriorates to the point that the borrower needs to be given temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan during 2009 the company modified 121 million of cre loans other real estate owned is acquired primarily through or in lieu of foreclosure on loans secured by real estate 

as reflected in schedule 41 the company’s nonperforming assets as a percentage of net loans and leases and oreo increased significantly during 2009 the percentage was 680 at december 31 2009 600 excluding fdicsupported assets compared with 271 on december 31 2008 and 070 on december 31 2007 total nonperforming lending related assets were 2769 million at december 31 2009 2359 million excluding fdicsupported assets compared to 1138 million at december 31 2008 and 274 million at december 31 2007 

total nonaccrual loans excluding fdicsupported loans at december 31 2009 increased 1077 million from the balances at december 31 2008 which included increases of 368 million for commercial construction and land development loans 316 million for commercial owner occupied loans 184 million for commercial real estate term loans 171 million for commercial and industrial loans and 65 million for consumer real estate loans the increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily in texas utah and california while all the other markets experienced increases as well total nonperforming assets excluding fdicsupported assets increased 1221 million from the balances at december 31 2008 

  

the following schedule sets forth the company’s nonperforming lending related assets 

schedule 41 

nonperforming lending related assets 

 

  

   

included in nonaccrual loans are loans that we have determined to be impaired loans other than those included in large groups of smallerbalance homogeneous loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement including scheduled interest payments the amount of the impairment is measured based on either the present value of expected cash flows the observable fair value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan 

the company’s total recorded investment in impaired loans was 1925 million at december 31 2009 and 770 million at december 31 2008 estimated losses on impaired loans are included in the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2009 the allowance included 105 million for impaired loans with a recorded investment of 435 million at december 31 2008 the allowance for loan losses included 52 million for impaired loans with a recorded investment of 306 million see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on impaired loans 

in addition to the lending related nonperforming assets the company also has 171 million in carrying value of investments in debt securities that are on nonaccrual status at december 31 2009 

allowance for credit losses 

allowance for loan losses – in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

for commercial loans we use historical loss experience factors by loan type and quality grade adjusted for changes in trends and conditions to help determine an indicated allowance for each portfolio segment currently the company reestimates all commercial loss reserve factors based on very recent loss experience on a quarterly basis these factors are evaluated and updated using migration analysis techniques and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific segment these other considerations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the segment evaluations nonaccrual loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of 500 thousand or more as well as consumer loans designated as troubled debt restructurings are individually evaluated in accordance with asc 310 receivables to determine the level of impairment and establish a specific reserve 

the allowance for consumer loans is determined using historically developed loss experience “roll rates” at which loans migrate from one delinquency level to the next higher level using current roll rates for the most recent sixmonth period and comparing projected losses to actual loss experience the models estimate expected losses in dollars for the forecasted period of twelve months by refreshing the models with updated data losses are projected for a new twelvemonth period each month segmenting the portfolio into twelve consumer loan 

  

product groupings and four bankcard product groupings with similar risk profiles the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios’ models implicitly take into consideration housing price depreciation appreciation and homeowners’ loss gain of equity in the collateral by incorporating current roll rates and loss severity rates the models make no assumptions about future housing price changes this methodology is an accepted industry practice and the company believes it has a sufficient volume of information to produce reliable projections 

as a final step to the evaluation process we perform an additional review of the adequacy of the allowance based on the loan portfolio in its entirety this enables us to mitigate but not eliminate the imprecision inherent in loan and segmentlevel estimates of expected credit losses this review of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any adjustments necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excessive concentration risks

schedule 43 provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation among the portfolio segments 

schedule 43 

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 

 

 the total allowance for loan losses at december 31 2009 increased 844 million from the level at yearend 2008 for 2009 the 294 million increase in the allowance for loan losses for commercial lending reflects deterioration of borrower credit quality due to difficult economic conditions reductions in collateral values and increases in realized loss rates that increased our quantitative loss factors for commercial real estate and consumer portfolios as well the 462 million increase in the allowance for commercial real estate loans largely reflects the impact of deteriorating credit quality conditions in the commercial construction land acquisition and development portfolios across the company 

reserve for unfunded lending commitments  the company also estimates a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is included with other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet with any related increases or decreases in the reserve included in noninterest expense in the statement of income 

we determine the reserve for unfunded lending commitments using a process that is similar to the one we use for commercial loans based on historical experience we have developed experiencebased loss factors that we apply to the company’s unfunded lending commitments to estimate the potential for loss inherent in such commitments 

the company has historically maintained a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2008 refinements to this process were implemented to include unfunded portions of partially funded credits this action resulted in the reclassification of 279 million from the allowance for loan losses to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments

 interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates on the company’s net interest income market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company the boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board reviews the key strategies set by management for managing risk establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews reported limit exceptions the board has established the management assetliability committee “alco” to which it has delegated the functional management of interest rate and market risk for the company alco’s primary responsibilities include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have the net interest margin increase slightly in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being slightly “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise however as noted below the company has intentionally positioned its balance sheet to be more asset sensitive as compared to 2008 

we attempt to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income through the use of interest rate floors on variable rate loans interest rate swaps and by avoiding large exposures to longterm fixed rate interestearning assets that have significant negative convexity the prime lending rate and the libor curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

we monitor this risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods duration of equity and income simulation in the duration of equity method we measure the expected changes in the fair values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the income simulation method we analyze the expected changes in income in response to changes in interest rates 

duration of equity is derived by first calculating the dollar duration of all assets liabilities and derivative instruments dollar duration is determined by calculating the fair value of each instrument assuming interest rates sustain immediate and parallel movements up 1 and down 1 the average of these two changes in fair value is the dollar duration subtracting the dollar duration of liabilities from the dollar duration of assets and adding the net dollar duration of derivative instruments results in the dollar duration of equity duration of equity is computed by dividing the dollar duration of equity by the fair value of equity the company’s policy is to maintain duration of equity between 3 to 7 

income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income is measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio 

both of these measurement methods require that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of duration and income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is managed actively to try to maintain a consistent slightly assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

  

we should note that estimated duration of equity and the income simulation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these estimates we view both the duration of equity and the income simulation results as falling within a range of possibilities 

for income simulation company policy requires that interest sensitive income from a static balance sheet be limited to a decline of no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 basis points 

as of the dates indicated schedule 46 shows the company’s estimated range of duration of equity and percentage change in interest sensitive income based on a static balance sheet in the first year after the rate change if interest rates were to sustain an immediate parallel change of 200 basis points the “fast” and “slow” results differ based on the assumed speed of repricing of administeredrate deposits money market interestonchecking and savings 

schedule 46 

duration of equity and interest sensitive income 

 

  

 during 2009 the duration of equity became shorter as compared to december 31 2008 the reduction of the duration of equity was due to increased long term debt shorter duration of assets and management decisions to eliminate fair value interest rate swaps on fixed rate debt and terminate without replacement a number of “receive fixed” interest rate swaps on pools of floating rate loans 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at the end of 2009 approximately 78 of the company’s commercial loan and commercial real estate portfolios were floating rate and primarily tied to either prime or libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have floating interest rates this means that these loans reprice quickly in response to changes in interest rates – more quickly on average than does their funding base this posture resulted in a natural position that is more “assetsensitive” than the company believes is desirable 

the company attempts to mitigate this tendency toward asset sensitivity through the use of interest rate floors on loans to protect against declining rates and through the use of interest rate swaps in past years we also had contracted to convert most of the company’s longterm fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt through the use of interest rate swaps however in the first quarter of 2009 these swaps were terminated when management decided to position the company to be more asset sensitive in light of historically low shortterm interest rates 

  

and unprecedented “quantitative easing” monetary policy actions by the federal reserve we also traditionally have engaged in an ongoing program of swapping primebased and liborbased loans for “receivefixed” contracts however during 2009 we terminated and did not replace a number of such swaps as they became ineffective under asc 815 with the same objective of positioning the company’s balance sheet to be more asset sensitive at yearend 2009 the company had a notional amount of approximately 09 billion of such cash flow hedge contracts this notional amount is approximately 15 billion less than at yearend 2008 these swaps also expose the company to counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk the company’s approach to managing this risk is discussed in “credit risk management” on page 103 the company retains basis risk due to changes between the prime rate and libor on nonhedge derivative basis swaps see “accounting for derivatives” on page 47 for further details about our derivative instruments finally the company’s subsidiary banks made increasing use of interest rate floors on new loans as of december 31 2009 approximately 263 of the company’s floating rate loans were priced at floors that were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 155 on that date 

the company believes that these dynamic balance sheet changes during 2009 including changes in the mix of deposits and other funding sources have tended to have a somewhat larger effect on the net interest spread and net interest margin than has the company’s interest rate risk position as a result of these changes the company ended 2009 with an interest rate risk position that was more assetsensitive than at the end of 2008 as shown in schedule 46

 note balances are based upon the portfolio at december 31 2009 excludes interest rate swap products that we provide as a service to our customers 

market risk – fixed income 

the company engages in the underwriting and trading of municipal and corporate securities this trading activity exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities held by the company 

at december 31 2009 trading account assets had been reduced to 235 million and securities sold not yet purchased were 434 million 

at yearend 2009 the company made a market in 639 fixed income securities through zions bank and its whollyowned subsidiary zions direct inc during 2009 78 of all trades were executed electronically the company is an oddlot securities dealer which means that most corporate security trades are for less than 250000 

the company is exposed to market risk through changes in fair value and otti of htm and afs securities the company also is exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in fair value in availableforsale securities and interest rate swaps are included in oci each quarter during 2009 the aftertax change in oci attributable to afs and htm securities was 2178 million the change attributable to interest rate swaps was 1286 million decreasing shareholders’ equity by 

  

3464 million if any of the afs securities or htm securities transferred from afs becomes other than temporarily impaired any credit impairment in oci is reversed and the impairment is charged to operations see “investment securities portfolio” on page 91 for additional information on otti 

market risk – equity investments 

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded and subject to fluctuations in their market prices or values in addition the company owns equity securities in companies that are not publicly traded that are accounted for under cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs in either case the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since the fair value of these securities may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss these equity investments are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

the company also invests in prepublic venture capital companies through various venture funds net of expenses income tax effects and noncontrolling interests losses were 19 million in 2009 and 30 million in 2008 and gains were 39 million in 2007 from these venture funds the company’s remaining equity exposure to these venture funds net of related noncontrolling interests at december 31 2009 was approximately 563 million compared to approximately 544 million at december 31 2008 

in addition to the program described above amegy has in place an alternative investments program these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds generally are not part of the strategy since the underlying companies are typically not credit worthy the carrying value of the investments at december 31 2009 was 628 million compared to 546 million at december 31 2008 the company has a total remaining funding commitment of 782 million to sbic nonsbic funds and private equity investments as of december 31 2009 528 million of this total funding commitment is at amegy 

the company also from time to time either starts and funds businesses or makes significant investments in companies of strategic interest these investments may result in either minority or majority ownership positions and usually give the parent or its subsidiaries board representation these strategic investments are in companies that are financial services or financial technologies providers examples include contango and netdeposit which are majority or whollyowned by the company and life quotes inc and identrust in which the company owns significant but minority positions 

liquidity risk 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy this policy addresses maintaining adequate liquidity diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary bank levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and bank subsidiaries 

  

managing liquidity and funding is performed centrally by zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans as well as to the policy guidelines these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and potentially to the company’s board of directors the subsidiary banks have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and the federal reserve and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank andor correspondent banks the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer but are not involved in any other funding decision processes 

contractual obligations 

schedule 48 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2009 

schedule 48 

contractual obligations 

 

  

   in addition to the commitments specifically noted in the previous schedule the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive cash or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on 

  

market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change for further information on derivative contracts see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity management actions 

the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders including the cpp preferred equity issued to the treasury the parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes management and other fees bank lines equity contributed through the exercise of stock options commercial paper and longterm debt and equity issuances the subsidiary banks’ primary source of funding is their core deposits operational cash flows while constituting a funding source for the company are not large enough to provide funding in the amounts that fulfill the needs of the parent and its subsidiary banks for 2009 operations contributed 1058 million toward these needs as a result the company utilizes other sources at its disposal to manage its liquidity needs 

most of the company’s subsidiary banks have seen reduced profitability or posted losses in recent quarters and therefore are currently unable to reliably pay dividends also earnings on the parent’s investment securities portfolio have been reduced cash earnings from subsidiaries and investments currently do not cover the parent’s interest and dividend payments and the company does not expect cash receipts from its subsidiaries and investments to cover those payments in 2010 in addition the parent has had to increase its investment in several of its bank subsidiaries in order to maintain capital levels appropriate to current weak economic and credit quality conditions the company has reduced the dividend on its common stock in several stages to 001 per share per quarter in order to conserve both capital and cash federal reserve board supervisory letter sr 094 dated february 24 2009 reiterates and expands previous guidance regarding the payment of common dividends and dividends on more senior capital instruments in times of stress on earnings and capital ratios 

general financial market and economic conditions both of which have been highly stressed since mid2008 or earlier as well as the company’s debt ratings have adversely impacted the company’s access to external financing one rating agency moody’s has downgraded the company’s senior debt rating to b2 while standard  poors fitch and dbrs all rate the company’s senior debt at a low investment grade all of the agencies have indicated that continued high loan losses andor losses related to the company’s investment portfolio of cdos could erode capital levels and cause further downgrades in the company’s debt ratings additional information regarding rating agency actions may be found subsequently 

during 2009 the parent received 5 million in cash dividends from various subsidiaries the amounts of dividends the banking subsidiaries can pay to the parent are restricted by earnings retained earnings and riskbased capital requirements this source of funding to the parent may become more limited or even unavailable if the operating performance of subsidiary banks deteriorates under continued weak economic conditions or changes in regulation or law see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of dividend capacities and limitations 

during 2009 the primary sources of cash available to the parent in the capital markets have been 1 unsecured 12 year senior notes issued by the parent 2 issuance of new shares of common stock 3 the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program “tlgp” debt program under which the company issued its maximum allowed 2549 million on january 21 2009 and 4 in september 2009 and december 2009 the company issued at a discount a total of 459 million of 775 unsecured senior notes which added approximately 393 million to the parent’s cash balance the parent’s cash balance was 542 million at december 31 2009 compared to 983 million at december 31 2008 

  

during 2009 the parent’s operating expenses included cash payments for interest of approximately 123 million additionally the parent paid 96 million in dividends on preferred and common stock note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains the parent’s statements of income and statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 as well as its balance sheets at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 

additional information regarding financing actions may be found subsequently in the summer of 2009 some other financing markets began to reopen for regional and larger banking companies but there can be no assurance that the company will have access to these markets at any given time 

for the year 2009 issuances of longterm debt exceeded repayments of longterm debt resulting in net cash inflows of 408 million net of 62 million discount as follows 

 

  

  

  

 in addition to the senior mediumterm notes classified as longterm debt we issued 118 million of senior medium term notes classified as shortterm debt and repaid 236 million of senior mediumterm notes classified as short term debt for a cash outflow of 118 million 

at december 31 2009 maturities of the senior mediumterm notes classified as long and shortterm debt ranged from may 2010 to september 2011 with rates from 525 to 600 

see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of the company’s longterm borrowings 

on a consolidated basis repayments of shortterm borrowings exceeded fundings excluding shortterm federal reserve borrowings and senior mediumterm notes and resulted in a 1086 million use of cash in 2009 the parent has a program to issue shortterm commercial paper however current market conditions have severely constrained activity in this program and at december 31 2009 outstanding commercial paper was 1 million 

access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is directly tied to the credit ratings they receive from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the parent had the following ratings as of december 31 2009 

schedule 49 

credit ratings 

 

   

during 2009 the company received 464 million of cash from the issuance of common stock and used 465 million including expenses of cash to tender for 1005 million par value of series a preferred stock 

the subsidiaries’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2009 these core deposits excluding brokered deposits in aggregate constituted 893 of consolidated deposits compared with 819 of consolidated deposits at december 31 2008 the company has also obtained brokered deposits to serve as an additional source of liquidity at december 31 2009 total brokered deposits were 16 billion down from 33 billion at december 31 2008 for 2009 deposit decreases resulted in net cash outflows of 2154 million which primarily resulted from decreases in time deposits and brokered deposits partially offset by increases in noninterestbearing demand deposits and savings and money market deposits 

on october 3 2008 the fdic increased deposit insurance to 250000 through december 31 2009 and in may 2009 extended the increased insurance coverage through december 31 2013 the fdic has also implemented a program to provide full deposit insurance coverage for noninterestbearing transaction deposit accounts through december 31 2009 unless insured banks elect to opt out of the program on august 26 2009 the fdic extended this program through june 30 2010 the company did not opt out of this program 

the fhlb system has from time to time been a significant source of liquidity for the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank and tcbw are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nba are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity requirements borrowings from the fhlb may increase in the future depending on availability of funding from other sources such as deposits the subsidiary banks are required to invest in fhlb stock to maintain their borrowing capacity the company is aware of recent news reports and fhlb member bank press releases regarding the financial strength of the fhlb system the company is actively monitoring its ability to borrow from the fhlb banks and took actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 to reduce its borrowings from the fhlb banks at december 31 2009 and 2008 the company did not have any shortterm borrowings outstanding from the fhlb at december 31 2009 and 2008 the subsidiary banks’ total investment in fhlb stock was approximately 136 million 

in december 2007 the federal reserve board announced a new program the term auction facility “taf” to make 28day loans to banks in the united states and to foreign banks through foreign central banks these loans are made using an auction process the company’s banking subsidiaries – zions bank cbt and amegy – have participated in this program and may continue to do so as long as money can be borrowed at an attractive rate amounts that can be borrowed are based upon the amount of collateral pledged to the federal reserve bank the company did not have any borrowings outstanding under this program at december 31 2009 and had 18 billion outstanding at december 31 2008 

at december 31 2009 the amount available for additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings was approximately 124 billion an additional 07 billion could be borrowed at december 31 2009 upon the pledging of additional available collateral 

zions bank has in prior years used asset securitizations to sell loans and provide a flexible alternative source of funding as a qspe securities conduit sponsored by zions bank lockhart purchased and held creditenhanced securitized assets resulting from certain small business loan securitizations during 2009 zions bank purchased 678 million of securities from lockhart at book value under the terms of a liquidity facility zions bank provided to lockhart during the second quarter of 2009 lockhart was consolidated onto the books of zions bank as a result of zions bank holding over 90 of lockhart’s asset backed commercial paper and in september 2009 lockhart was terminated see “termination of offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 103 for information about lockhart and the liquidity agreement 

while not considered a primary source of funding the company’s investment activities can also provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture that is being observed for 2009 investment 

  

securities activities resulted in an increase in investment securities holdings primarily due to zions bank purchasing securities from lockhart under the terms of the liquidity agreement and a net decrease of cash in the amount of 501 million 

maturing balances in the various loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows in most cases loan growth has resulted in net cash outflows from a funding standpoint however for 2009 organic activity resulted in a net cash inflow of 14 billion compared to a cash outflow of 25 billion in 2008 we expect continued weak loan demand during 2010 

operational risk management 

operational risk is the potential for unexpected losses attributable to human error systems failures fraud or inadequate internal controls and procedures in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has created a corporate risk management department whose responsibility is to help company management identify and assess key risks and monitor the key internal controls and processes that the company has in place to mitigate operational risk we have documented controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

to manage and minimize its operating risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments in addition reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we maintain contingency plans and systems for operations support in the event of natural or other disasters efforts are continually underway to improve the company’s oversight of operational risk including enhancement of riskcontrol self assessments and of antifraud measures 

capital management 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary banks other major cmc responsibilities include 

 

  

 the cmc in managing the capital of the company may set capital standards that are higher than those approved by the board but may not set lower limits 

the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

 

  

   

  

 see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on riskbased capital 

during 2009 the company took a number of actions to raise additional capital in order to maintain a strong capital position as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 the company also took several actions to raise additional capital during 2008 as follows 

 

  

  

 total controlling interest shareholders’ equity on december 31 2009 was 5693 million compared to 6502 million at december 31 2008 a decrease of 124 as of december 31 2009 the company had 563 million of remaining authorization from its board of directors for the repurchase of common stock the company has not repurchased any shares since august 2007 and in compliance with the conditions of the cpp the company will not repurchase any common shares during the period the senior preferred shares are outstanding without permission from the us department of the treasury 

during its january 2010 meeting the board of directors declared a dividend of 001 per common share payable on february 24 2010 to shareholders of record on february 10 2010 this is unchanged from the rate paid during third and fourth quarters of 2009 the company paid dividends in 2009 of 010 per common share compared with 161 per share in 2008 and 168 per share in 2007 under the terms of the cpp the company 

  

may not increase the dividend on its common stock above 032 per share per quarter during the period the senior preferred shares are outstanding without adversely impacting the company’s interest in the program or without permission from the us department of the treasury 

the company paid 119 million in dividends on common stock in 2009 and did not repurchase any shares of the company’s common stock 

the company recorded preferred stock dividends of 1030 million during 2009 compared to 244 million during 2008 preferred dividends for 2009 includes 886 million related to the tarp preferred stock issued to the us department of treasury 

schedule 50 

capital ratios 

 

  

 the decrease in total controlling interest shareholders’ equity from december 31 2008 is primarily due to net losses recognized during 2009 including noncash expenses resulting from goodwill impairment the negative impact of increased aftertax unrealized losses of 205 million on investment securities and derivatives included in oci and the preferred stock redemption these decreases were offset by capital raising actions including the issuance of common stock and the effect of the subordinated debt modification 

banking organizations are required under published regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios as of december 31 2009 the company and each of its subsidiary banks exceeded the “well capitalized” guidelines under these regulatory standards 

at december 31 2009 regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital and total riskbased capital were 5407 million and 6823 million compared to 5269 million and 7386 million at december 31 2008 

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply the bcbs has been working for a number of years on revisions to basel i in december 2007 us banking regulators published the final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” 

modifications to the basel ii regime “basel iii” continue to be proposed additionally regulators may subjectively require banking organizations to maintain capital reserves or liquidity at levels higher than those codified by regulation or those prior to the recent economic crisis adoption of new basel iii requirements andor regulatory actions may have a significant impact on bank capital and liquidity levels going forward 

  

gaap to nongaap reconciliation 

traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulators have assessed a bank’s capital adequacy based on tier 1 capital the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations regulators have begun supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier 1 capital known as tier 1 common equity while not codified analysts and banking regulators have assessed zions’ capital adequacy using the tier 1 common equity measure because tier 1 common equity is not formally defined by gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure and other entities may calculate them differently than zions’ disclosed calculations since analysts and banking regulators may assess zions’ capital adequacy using tier 1 common equity zions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess zions’ capital adequacy on this same basis 

tier 1 common equity is often expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets under the riskbased capital framework a bank’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of offbalance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the riskweighted assets total that as adjusted comprises the denominator of certain riskbased capital ratios tier 1 capital is then divided by this denominator riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 capital ratio adjustments are made to tier 1 capital to arrive at tier 1 common equity tier 1 common equity is also divided by the riskweighted assets to determine the tier 1 common equity ratio the amounts disclosed as riskweighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although this nongaap financial measure is frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company it has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

in connection with filing the form 10qs during 2009 for the quarterly periods ended june 30 2009 and september 30 2009 management under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each of those quarters in this original evaluation the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

in connection with the revision to the financial statements as described in the explanatory notes of the amended form 10qs for the quarterly periods ended june 30 2009 and september 30 2009 management reevaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each of those quarters in connection therewith management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting management determined that the company did not maintain effective controls over the process utilized to interpret the applicable accounting literature for computing and allocating the amount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature related to the subordinated debt modification management believes this control deficiency resulted in a misstatement of the net loss applicable to common shareholders and shareholders’ equity as a result of this material weakness management concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of june 30 2009 and september 30 2009 

in light of the material weakness described above management revised its consolidated financial statements in the form 10qas for the quarterly periods ended june 30 2009 and september 30 2009 as discussed previously to ensure that the computation and allocation of the beneficial conversion feature related to the debt modification was in conformity with the applicable accounting guidance management also believes that the consolidated financial statements included in those form 10qas were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in all material respects 

while management had identified the appropriate accounting guidance and recognized that the terms of the debt modification included a beneficial conversion feature management misinterpreted how to compute and allocate the amount attributable to this feature management does not routinely execute debt modifications with terms similar to this transaction and management believes that as a result of the process to reevaluate the accounting treatment this material weakness has been remediated management will continue to assess the actions necessary to maintain effective controls over the process utilized to evaluate the accounting for complex transactions such as debt modifications 

as a result of the preceding discussion management has also concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2009 however as discussed above in connection with filing the amended form 10qs for the quarterly periods ended june 30 2009 and september 30 2009 on february 11 2010 management believes that the material weakness previously identified has been remediated

competition 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks thrifts and credit unions including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies financial technology firms and a variety of other types of companies many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens 

the primary factors in competing for business include pricing convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered and the level of service delivered the company must compete effectively along all of these parameters to remain successful 

  

supervision and regulation 

the parent is a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company under the bhc act the grammleachbliley act of 1999 “the glb act” provides a regulatory framework for financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the federal reserve board “frb” the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company the parent must satisfy certain ongoing criteria 

in addition the company’s subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or the banking laws of their respective states as well as the rules and regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the frb and the fdic they are also under the supervision of and are continually subject to periodic examination by the occ or their respective state banking departments the frb and the fdic many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the securities and exchange commission “sec” financial industry regulatory authority “finra” andor state securities regulators our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states in which they conduct business 

the company is subject to various requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

 the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the 

  

supervisory policies they apply the bcbs has been working for a number of years on revisions to basel i in december 2007 us banking regulators published the final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” 

basel ii provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk – an internal ratingsbased approach tailored to individual institutions’ circumstances and a standardized approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in existing riskbased capital guidelines basel ii also sets capital requirements for operational risk and refines the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures operational risk is defined to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events basel i does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 

we are not currently an “opt in” bank holding company as the company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt the advanced approach however we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to companies that do adopt the advanced approach may make it necessary for the company to elect to “opt in” at some point whether or not this scenario emerges our risk management will be well served by our continuing investment in more sophisticated analytical capabilities and in an enhanced data environment 

in july 2008 the us banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would provide “noncore” banks with the option to adopt the standardized approach proposed in basel ii replacing the previously proposed basel 1a framework while the advanced approach uses sophisticated mathematical models to measure and assign capital to specific risks the standardized approach categorizes risks by type and then assigns capital requirements we are evaluating the benefit of adopting the standardized approach and will make a decision following publication of the final rule 

additional modifications of the basel ii regime continue to be proposed or adopted but the requirements of the cpp and the arra appear to be “overriding” for the time being on any basel ii issues as they might apply to the company 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company quoted on the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which addresses among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a comprehensive system of corporate governance practices this system includes corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct and charters for the audit credit review compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

  

regulators congress and state legislatures continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

government monetary policies 

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect shortterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit the tools available to the frb which may be used to implement monetary policy include 

 

  

  

  

  

 these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

in operating its banking businesses the company seeks to combine the front office or customer facing advantages that it believes can result from decentralized organization and branding with those that can come from centralized risk management capital management and operations in its specialty financial services and technology businesses the company seeks to develop a competitive advantage in a particular product customer or technology niche 

  

distribution of loans and deposits 

as shown in charts 1 and 2 the company’s loans and core deposits are widely diversified among the banking franchises the company operates 

note core deposits are defined as total deposits excluding 

brokered deposits and time deposits 100000 and over 

  

the company’s loan portfolio also is diversified as to type of loan however as shown in chart 3 it does have a significant concentration of exposure to commercial real estate including residential land acquisition and development lending in arizona nevada and to a lesser degree california and the intermountain west that have been under severe stress due to the ongoing declines in housingrelated prices and in residential building 

business strategies 

we believe that the company distinguishes itself by having a strategy for growth in its banking businesses that is unique for a bank holding company of its size this growth strategy is driven by four key factors 1 focus on high growth markets 2 keep decisions that affect customers local 3 centralize technology and operations to achieve economies of scale and 4 centralize and standardize policies and management controlling key risks these strategies are more fully set forth as follows 

focus on high growth markets 

each of the states in which the company conducts its banking businesses has experienced relatively high levels of historical economic growth and each ranks among the top onethird of states as ranked by population and household income growth projected by the us census bureau despite slowdowns in population employment and key indicators of economic growth in some of these markets in 2008 which is expected to persist through much of 2009 the company believes that over the medium to longer term all of these markets will continue to be among the fastest growing in the country 

  

schedule 1 

demographic profile 

by state 

 

  

  the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in these banking markets within each of the states where the company operates we focus on the market segments that we believe present the best opportunities for us we believe that these states over time have experienced higher rates of growth business formation and expansion than other states we also believe that over the long term these states will continue to experience higher rates of commercial real estate development as businesses provide housing shopping business facilities and other amenities for their growing populations however in the near term growth in many of our geographies and market segments has slowed markedly due to weakening economic conditions and loan demand we have recently experienced net portfolio shrinkage in distressed residential real estate markets in the southwest 

a common focus of all of zions’ subsidiary banks is small and middle market business banking including the personal banking needs of the executives and employees of those businesses and commercial real estate development in addition to our commercial business we also provide a broad base of consumer financial products in selected markets including home mortgages home equity credit lines auto loans and credit cards this mix of business often leads to loan balances growing faster than internally generated deposits this was particularly true in much of 2008 as loan growth significantly outpaced low cost core deposit growth in addition it has important implications for the company’s management of certain risks including interest rate and liquidity risks which are discussed further in later sections of this document 

keep decisions that affect customers local 

the company operates eight different communityregional banks each under a different name and each with its own charter chief executive officer and management team this structure helps to ensure that decisions related to customers are made at a local level in addition each bank controls among other things most decisions related to its branding market strategies customer relationships product pricing and credit decisions within the limits of established corporate policy in this way we are able to differentiate our banks from much larger “mass market” banking competitors that operate regional or national franchises under a common brand and often 

  

around “vertical” product silos we believe that this approach allows us to attract and retain exceptional management and that it also results in providing service of the highest quality to our targeted customers in addition we believe that over time this strategy generates superior growth in our banking businesses 

centralize technology and operations to achieve economies of scale 

we seek to differentiate the company from smaller banks in two ways first we use the combined scale of all of the banking operations to create a broad product offering without the fragmentation of systems and operations that would typically drive up costs second for certain products for which economies of scale are believed to be important the company “manufactures” the product centrally or outsources it from a third party examples include cash management credit card administration mortgage servicing and deposit operations in this way the company seeks to create and maintain efficiencies while generating superior growth 

centralize and standardize policies and management controlling key risks 

we seek to standardize policies and practices related to the management of key risks in order to assure a consistent risk profile in an otherwise decentralized management model among these key risks and functions are credit interest rate liquidity and market risks although credit decisions are made locally within each affiliate bank these decisions are made within the framework of a corporate credit policy that is standard among all of our affiliate banks each bank may amend the policy in a more conservative direction however it may not amend the policy in a more liberal direction in that case it must request a specific waiver from the company’s chief credit officer in practice only a limited number of waivers have been granted similarly the credit examination function is a corporate activity reporting to the credit review committee of the board of directors and administratively reporting to the director of enterprise risk management who reports to the company’s ceo this assures a reasonable consistency of loan quality grading and loan loss reserving practices among all affiliate banks 

interest rate risk management liquidity and market risk and portfolio investments also are managed centrally by a boarddesignated asset liability management committee pursuant to corporate policies regarding interest rate risk liquidity investments and derivatives 

internal audit also is a centralized corporate function reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors and administratively reporting to the director of enterprise risk management who reports to the company’s ceo 

finally the board established an enterprise risk management committee in late 2005 which is supported by the director of enterprise risk management this committee seeks to monitor and mitigate as appropriate these and other key operating and strategic risks throughout the company 

management’s overview of 2008 performance 

the “subprime mortgage” crisis became a financial crisis in the latter half of 2007 and the economy entered into an increasingly severe economic recession during 2008 in 2008 both financing and capital became increasingly expensive and difficult for the company to obtain as the year went on finally in midseptember which saw in rapid succession the effective nationalization of fannie mae and freddie mac the failure of lehman brothers and the federal “rescue” of insurance giant american international group inc “aig” essentially all capital and financial markets worldwide became extremely disrupted 

as this crisis unfolded and became more severe the federal reserve board “frb” and later the us treasury took a series of increasingly strong and less conventional actions to try to mitigate the crisis starting in mid2007 the frb aggressively lowered short term interest rates after a brief pause in mid2008 this aggressive reduction resumed and left the target fed funds rate at an alltime low of 0025 at yearend 2008 in 2008 the frb introduced a number of programs to directly provide greater liquidity to a financial system under severe stress including trying to formally remove any stigma from discount window borrowings followed by a series of 

  

programs to inject liquidity directly into the banking system such as the term auction facility “taf” and later into financial markets more broadly as capital levels in the banking system became increasingly strained active and possibly abusive shortselling of financial stocks including that of the company rose to unprecedented levels this activity made it increasingly difficult for financial companies to raise additional capital without causing existing shareholders to incur high levels of ownership dilution and led the securities and exchange commission “sec” to enact a series of temporary bans on shortselling of financial stocks and certain abusive shortselling practices in the fall of 2008 the treasury’s troubled asset relief program “tarp” capital purchase program “cpp” to invest in preferred stock of financial institutions was launched in september followed by the frb’s commercial paper funding facility “cpff” program and the federal deposit insurance corporation’s “fdic” temporary liquidity guarantee program “tlgp” in november the cpp provided for the direct investment of 350 billion of preferred equity into the banking system while the tlgp provided a way for banks with maturing unsecured senior debt to refinance that debt with a guarantee provided by the fdic these programs and actions had the objective of preserving a functioning banking and financial system that could continue to finance economic activity during a time of severe financial and economic stress 

on october 3 2008 the fdic increased deposit insurance to 250000 through december 31 2009 in addition the fdic implemented a program to provide full deposit insurance coverage for noninterestbearing transaction deposit accounts through december 31 2009 unless insured banks elect to opt out of the program the company did not opt out of this program 

the crisis clearly adversely impacted the company’s performance and management focused a great deal of attention on managing the impact of the crisis 

the company reported a net loss of 2663 million for 2008 as compared to net income of 4937 million for 2007 net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2008 was 2907 million or 266 per diluted common share this compares with net earnings applicable to common shareholders of 4794 million or 442 per diluted share for 2007 and 5793 million or 536 per share for 2006 return on average common equity was 569 and return on average assets was 050 in 2008 compared with 957 and 101 in 2007 and 1289 and 132 in 2006 

the key drivers of the company’s performance during 2008 were as follows

the company’s performance in 2008 compared to 2007 reflected the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we continue to focus on managing four primary drivers of our business performance 1 loan and deposit growth 2 credit quality 3 interest rate risk and 4 controlling expenses however in 2008 results also were significantly and adversely impacted by the effects of the global financial crisis on the company’s securities portfolio liquidity and capital levels 

loan and deposit growth 

since 2004 the company has experienced steady and strong loan growth and moderate deposit growth augmented in 2005 and 2006 by the amegy acquisition in 2007 by the stockmen’s acquisition and in 2008 by the silver state acquisition deposits only from 2004 through 2006 we consider this performance to be primarily a result of strong economic conditions throughout most of our geographical footprint and of effectively executing our operating strategies the continued strong organic loan growth in the latter half of 2007 may also have begun to reflect the increasing lack of nonbank sources of credit as global credit market conditions deteriorated sharply chart 4 depicts this growth 

  

the company experienced little or no net organic loan growth in 2008 in its three southwestern banks cbt nba and nsb which were most heavily impacted by deteriorating conditions in the residential real estate markets in these banks repayments and chargeoffs of residential acquisition and development loans largely offset some growth in other types of lending 

despite credit quality deterioration and net loan portfolio shrinkage in these three banks the company experienced actual periodend to periodend loan growth of 71 in 2008 however 12 billion of the total loan growth of 28 billion reflected the required purchase from lockhart of small business loans made and securitized in prior years these loans were purchased due to lockhart’s inability to sell commercial paper and a ratings downgrade that resulted not from deterioration in the loans but rather from a downgrade of bond insurance company mbia which provided the credit enhancement of the aaarated securitization tranches excluding these purchases all of this organic loan growth totaled 16 billion or 41 all of this growth occurred in the first half of 2008 in the third quarter the company actively held down net loan growth to mitigate the funding and capital strains mentioned earlier in the fourth quarter after funding strains and capital positions improved the company relaxed these selfimposed growth constraints however fourth quarter growth in many loan categories was offset by repayments and chargeoffs in the southwest residential acquisition and development portfolio in 2008 net loan growth in our cbt nba and nsb subsidiaries was negative due to these repayments and chargeoffs of real estate secured loans 

reflecting trends throughout the banking industry average core deposits grew only 18 billion or 57 from yearend 2007 including the effect of the silver state acquisition which lagged the growth rate of loans in addition average noninterestbearing demand deposits decreased by 03 billion from yearend 2007 thus the company increased its reliance on more costly sources of funding during the year 

in 2008 the company reviewed opportunities to augment organic growth by the potential acquisition of several distressed and failed banks but concluded only one—the purchase in september from the fdic of the insured deposits and a minimal amount of loans of the failed silver state bank in nevada in february 2009 the company was the successful bidder in the fdic disposition of the loans and deposits of the failed alliance bank in southern california this bid was made after the company had conducted due diligence on the alliance credit portfolio and involved a credit loss sharing agreement with the fdic the company believes that current economic stresses affecting a number of banking companies may result in more opportunities in 2009 to acquire distressed or failed banks where risk can be mitigated but this cannot be assured 

credit quality 

the ratio of nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned “oreo” increased to 271 at yearend compared to 073 at the end of 2007 net loan chargeoffs for 2008 were 3937 million or 096 of average loans compared to 636 million or 017 of average loans for 2007 charts 7 and 8 highlight net chargeoffs by loan purpose and bank affiliate the provision for loan losses during 2008 increased significantly to 6483 million compared to 1522 million for 2007 while the company’s ratio of nonperforming assets to net loans and oreo is now higher than peer averages see chart 5 its net chargeoff rate remains well below peer averages see chart 6 we believe that both of these trends reflect the collateral secured nature of many of the company’s problem loans which lead to higher nonaccrual levels and lower net losses than for example portfolios of peers with large unsecured credit card or other consumer loan concentrations 

all of these trends largely reflect the impact of deteriorating credit quality conditions in residential land acquisition and development and construction lending in the southwest in addition in the latter part of 2008 the company began to see evidence of spillover as evidenced by for example rising delinquency rates of this deterioration into other geographies and components of its portfolio including some segments of its residential first mortgage portfolio commercial and industrial lending and nonresidential commercial real estate construction lending due to the continuing and worsening recessionary economic conditions that unfolded late in 2008 and into 2009 we believe that stresses on our credit portfolio likely will continue at least in the first half of 2009 and possibly throughout the year and into 2010

interest rate risk 

our focus in managing interest rate risk is to not take positions based upon management’s forecasts of interest rates but rather to maintain a position of slight “assetsensitivity” this means that our assets primarily loans tend to reprice slightly more quickly than our liabilities primarily deposits the company makes extensive use of interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk in order to seek to achieve this desired position this practice has enabled us to achieve a relatively stable net interest margin during periods of volatile interest rates which is depicted in chart 9 however due to changes in newly originated and renewed loan spreads changes in the relationship between the prime rate and london interbank offer rate “libor” changes in the pattern of prime rate behavior in several of our banks and other factors our hedging strategy was more difficult to conduct in 2008 in particular we incurred nonhedge derivative losses in noninterest income and a number of our interest 

  

rate swaps became ineffective under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and were terminated nonetheless on the whole our interest rate risk management believes its actions continued to result in one of the highest and most stable net interest margins in the industry we believe that our risk position at december 31 2008 was more “asset sensitive” than has typically been the case reflecting in part a lessening of hedging activity due to the historically low interest rate environment 

taxableequivalent net interest income in 2008 increased 46 over 2007 the net interest margin declined to a still high 418 for 2008 down from 443 for 2007 the company was able to achieve this performance despite rising levels of nonaccrual loans and other nonperforming assets adverse changes in its funding mix and significant pressures on funding costs these factors resulted in a fairly steady compression until the fourth quarter of the net interest margin

throughout 2008 the relationships among a number of interest rates that are key drivers of the company’s business deviated significantly and for long periods from normal of particular significance were the relationships between deposit rates the prime rate and libor due to liquidity strains throughout the banking industry rates on bank deposits remained higher than would have been expected despite the unprecedented frb actions to reduce rates in some cases deposit rates in the company’s markets appear to have remained high in part due to the particular stresses being felt by several large institutions that later failed or were sold these pressures combined with the lack of lower cost core deposit growth kept the company’s cost of funding its loans and other assets higher than might have been expected these same stresses were felt worldwide and until very late in 2008 libor rates stayed unusually high in relation to riskfree rates and in relation to lending rates which generally followed the fed funds rates down as the frb aggressively pushed that rate lower 

strong loan growth in the first half of 2008 thus was funded primarily with interestbearing deposits and nondeposit funding noninterestbearing deposits as noted actually declined during the year which pressured the net interest margin mitigating these funding cost pressures were somewhat improved loan pricing spreads relative to libor and prime rates during the year

controlling expenses 

during 2008 the company’s efficiency expensetorevenue ratio increased to 675 from 605 for 2007 the efficiency ratio is the relationship between noninterest expense and total taxableequivalent revenue the increase in the efficiency ratio to 675 for 2008 was primarily due to the effect on revenue of the impairment and valuation losses on securities as previously discussed because of the significant securities impairment and valuation losses the company believes that its efficiency ratio is not a particularly useful measure of how well operating expenses were contained in 2007 and 2008 nor does it believe that this measure is particularly useful for its peers many of which also experienced large losses and impairment charges as a result of market turmoil and deteriorating credit conditions the company’s efficiency ratio was 589 and 567 if the impairment and valuation losses on securities are excluded for 2008 and 2007 respectively noninterest expense increased 50 in 2008 compared to 2007 over half of this increase resulted from further chargedowns of oreo and oreo expense excluding the effects of changes in oreo expense noninterest expense grew 17 in 2008 compared to 2007

effects of global financial crisis on the company 

it is now well recognized that during the period of roughly 20042006 a speculative bubble developed in residential housing in some of the company’s key markets including arizona southern nevada and parts of california and elsewhere in the united states the volume of mortgage debt outstanding grew at unprecedented rates fueled by record low interest rates and increasingly lax lending standards as reflected by socalled subprime alta and other alternative mortgages median housing prices and housing starts both increased to record levels during this period home equity lending standards also deteriorated as lenders were lulled by low default rates and rising home prices 

the company itself never originated subprime mortgages had almost no direct exposure to these loans and never offered residential option adjustable rate mortgage “arm” or “negative amortization” loans however the company has a significant business in financing residential land acquisition development and construction 

  

activity the frb began raising interest rates in 20052007 as it became increasingly apparent that the prevailing levels of housing activity were unsustainable new housing starts hit a record of over 2 million units in each of 2005 and 2006 by december 2007 they had fallen to a revised annualized rate of approximately 11 million nationally and by december 2008 had fallen further to about 550000 this precipitous decline in housing activity has placed significant stress on a number of the company’s homebuilder customers and therefore on the company’s loan portfolio in this sector this portfolio peaked in mid2006 as a percentage of the total loan portfolio and declined as a percentage of the total loan portfolio thereafter additionally the portfolio began to shrink in dollar terms in the latter half of 2007 in the southwestern markets and continued to shrink throughout 2008 as a result of paydowns loan sales chargeoffs and foreclosures nonaccrual loans and provisions for loan losses began to increase significantly in late summer 2007 and continued to increase in 2008 as it became clearer that this housing slump would likely be longer and deeper than originally believed it also became clear that in the latter months of 2008 the economic recession began to deepen and also became global and likely would persist and possibly continue to deepen well into 2009 the company therefore believes that nonaccrual loans the provision for loan losses and net chargeoffs will likely remain elevated throughout this period 

a number of previously successful and respected financial institutions failed were “rescued” or acquired with governmental assistance in 2008 including in the united states bear stearns in march indymac bank in july fannie mae freddie mac merrill lynch and lehman brothers in september and wachovia and washington mutual in october as this crisis unfolded capital and funding markets became increasingly strained and eventually essentially ceased to function worldwide in midseptember market values of financial institutions globally including that of the company plummeted and issuance of new funding and capital became increasingly expensive or impossible 

traditional markets for underwritten offerings of holding company unsecured senior debt effectively became closed to regional banking companies like zions in the last few months of 2007 and remained closed through 2008 during this time zions had several hundred million dollars of senior debt funding that matured and needed to be replaced with new funding unless cash reserves were to be depleted zions successfully refunded or newly issued a total of 560 million of medium term senior notes from the second half of 2007 through august 2008 using its brokerdealer subsidiary zions direct during this time it was one of a very few if any regional banking companies to successfully issue this type of debt financing similarly the market for underwritten perpetual preferred stock offerings essentially closed to all regional banking companies after may 2008 but zions again used zions direct to issue approximately 47 million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock in july finally in early september zions became the last us regional banking company to issue any significant amount of common equity in 2008 when it issued 250 million of common stock 

beginning in january 2008 several of the company’s affiliate banks began to bid for funds in the frb’s taf program and at a peak in december 2008 the company had a total of 21 billion of such funds by yearend this amount had declined to 18 billion and further declined to 05 billion by midfebruary 2009 lockhart also elected to participate in the frb’s cpff program and at yearend had sold 80 million of its commercial paper to the frb in october the company submitted an application for 14 billion of preferred capital under the treasury’s cpp program near the maximum 148 billion for which it was eligible this application was approved and funded in november in early december the company and each of its affiliate banks elected to participate in the fdic’s tlgp and in january 2009 the company issued the maximum amount of such debt for which it was eligible 2549 million taken together these and other actions taken by the company significantly improved both its holding company and bank liquidity and capital positions and at yearend left the company in a much stronger position to manage through the continuing economic downturn however as many normal capital and funding markets remained highly disrupted at the end of 2008 further stresses in 2009 may be anticipated 

these capital market stresses also had a significant impact on the company’s investment securities portfolio a total of 317 million of otherthantemporaryimpairment “otti” and valuation charges were taken against earnings during 2008 compared to 158 million in 2007 in addition reductions in fair value of 

  

this portfolio that were recorded in other comprehensive income “oci” totaled 246 million in 2008 compared to 111 million in 2007 collateralized debt obligation “cdo” securities became increasingly difficult to value in 2008 as normal markets for them ceased to exist and under the provisions of sfas 157 the company switched to level 3 model valuations for the great majority of them by yearend 2008 see page 37 for further discussion of the company’s valuation of these securities since the weakening economy continues to place stress on the underlying bank insurance and real estate exposures in many of these securities the company believes it is possible that further impairment charges andor oci impact may occur in 2009 

capital and return on capital 

as regulated financial institutions the parent and its subsidiary banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios one of our goals is to maintain capital levels that are at least “well capitalized” under regulatory standards the company and each of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the “well capitalized” guidelines at december 31 2008 in addition the parent and certain of its banking subsidiaries have issued various debt securities that have been rated by the principal rating agencies as a result another goal is to maintain capital at levels consistent with an “investment grade” rating for these debt securities the company has maintained its “investment grade” debt ratings as have those of its bank subsidiaries that have ratings 

at yearend 2008 the company’s tangible common equity ratio increased to 589 compared to 570 at the end of 2007 as noted previously amid very difficult capital market conditions in the latter half of 2008 the company strengthened its capital position by issuing 47 million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and 250 million of common equity in november 2008 the company participated in the cpp also known as tarp capital and issued 14 billion of cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a common stock warrant attached to the us treasury further in october 2008 the company reduced the quarterly dividend on its common stock from 043 to 032 per share and in january 2009 again reduced this dividend to 004 per share in order to conserve capital in a highly uncertain environment 

this series of actions resulted in capital ratios at zions at yearend that were higher than in over a decade for all ratios except the tangible common equity ratio at december 31 2008 the company’s tangible common equity ratio was 589 and its tangible equity ratio was 886 

  

the company expects that it and the banking industry as a whole may be required by market forces andor regulation to operate with higher capital ratios than in the recent past in addition the cpp capital preferred dividend increases from 5 to 9 in 2013 making it much more expensive as a source of capital if not redeemed at or prior to that time thus in addition to maintaining higher levels of capital the company’s capital structure may be subject to greater variation over the next few years than has been true historically 

in addition we believe that the company should engage or invest in business activities that provide attractive returns on equity chart 13 illustrates that as a result of earnings improvement the exit of underperforming businesses and returning unneeded capital to the shareholders the company’s return on average common equity improved from 2004 to 2005 the decline in 2006 resulted from the additional common equity held due to the acquisition of amegy the further decline in the return on average common equity in 2007 and again in 2008 resulted primarily from goodwill impairment securities impairment charges and larger provision for loan losses discussed previously as well as from the additional common equity issued to acquire stockmen’s 

  

as depicted in chart 14 tangible return on average tangible common equity further improved in 2006 as the company continued to improve its core operating results however it deteriorated significantly in 2007 and 2008 primarily as a result of the securities impairment and valuation losses and the increased provision for loan losses discussed previously 

note tangible return is net earnings applicable to common 

shareholders plus aftertax amortization of core deposit and 

other intangibles and impairment losses on goodwill 

challenges to operations 

as we enter 2009 we see a number of significant challenges confronting the industry and our company 

global capital and funding markets remain under significant stress and most observers believe that the current us and global economic recession may grow more severe at least through the first half of 2009 this continued economic weakness may lead to 

 

  

  

 capital and funding markets remain highly disrupted as we enter 2009 some funding markets improved somewhat late in 2008 but these improvements may be largely due to the unprecedented efforts of the frb and fdic to inject liquidity into the financial system it is highly uncertain how those markets will develop in 2009 and how they will react if and when this governmental support begins to be withdrawn while the company by many measures has higher levels of capital and funding than it has had in a very long time the company like all financial institutions at some point may need to access capital and funding markets to support its operations the conditions under which the company can access those markets may remain highly uncertain in 2009 

these challenges and others are more fully discussed under “risk factors” on page 11 

  

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the notes to consolidated financial statements contain a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies we believe that an understanding of certain of these policies along with the related estimates that we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important in order to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following is a discussion of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

we have included sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

fair value accounting 

effective january 1 2008 the company adopted sfas no 157 fair value measurements and sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements adoption of sfas 157 for the measurement of all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities was delayed one year until january 1 2009 the adoption of sfas 157 did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements but significantly expanded the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 

sfas 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date to measure fair value sfas 157 has established a hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs this hierarchy uses three levels of inputs to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities as follows 

level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities includes certain us treasury and other us government and agency securities actively traded in overthecounter markets certain securities sold not yet purchased and certain derivatives 

level 2 – observable inputs other than level 1 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in less active markets or other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data also includes derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with observable market inputs or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data this category generally includes certain us government and agency securities certain cdo securities corporate debt securities certain private equity investments certain securities sold not yet purchased and certain derivatives see “accounting for derivatives” on page 44 for further details on fair value accounting for derivatives 

level 3 – unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity for financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation additionally observable inputs such as nonbinding single dealer quotes that are not corroborated by observable market data are included in this category this category generally includes certain private equity investments and certain cdo securities 

  

the company uses models when quotations are not available for certain securities or in markets where trading activity has slowed or ceased when quotations are not available and are not provided by third party pricing services management judgment is necessary to determine fair value in situations involving management judgment fair value is determined using discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models which incorporate available market information including appropriate benchmarking to similar instruments analysis of default and recovery rates estimation of prepayment characteristics and implied volatilities 

at december 31 2008 approximately 60 of total assets or 33 billion consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis of this amount 24 billion of these financial instruments used valuation methodologies involving marketbased or marketderived information collectively level 1 and 2 measurements to measure fair value approximately 895 million of these financial assets are measured using modelbased techniques or nonbinding single dealer quotes both of which constitute level 3 measurements at december 31 2008 approximately 045 of total liabilities or 221 million consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2008 approximately 050 of total assets or 276 million of financial assets were valued on a nonrecurring basis at level 2 

fair value option 

sfas 159 allows for the option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value initially and at subsequent measurement dates with changes in fair value included in earnings the option may be applied instrument by instrument but is on an irrevocable basis on january 1 2008 the company applied the fair value option to one availableforsale real estate investment trust “reit” trust preferred cdo security and three retained interests on selected small business loan securitizations the reit cdo and retained interests were valued using level 3 models the cumulative effect of adopting sfas 159 reduced the beginning balance of retained earnings at january 1 2008 by approximately 115 million comprised of a decrease of 117 million for the reit cdo and an increase of 02 million for the three retained interests during 2008 the net change in fair value decreased pretax earnings by approximately 92 million consisting of 71 million for the reit cdo security and 21 million for the retained interests these adjustments to fair value are included in fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss in the statement of income 

the company elected the fair value option for the reit cdo security as part of a directional hedging program in an effort to hedge the credit exposure the company has to homebuilders in its reit cdo portfolio management selected this security because it had the most exposure to the homebuilder market compared to the other reit cdo securities in the company’s portfolio both in dollar amount and as a percentage and was therefore considered the most suitable for hedging the fair value option adoption for the reit cdo allows the company to avoid the complex hedge accounting provisions under sfas 133 associated with the implemented hedging program 

on june 23 2008 zions bank purchased 787 million of securities from lockhart which comprised the entire remaining small business loan securitizations created by zions bank and held by lockhart as a result the three small business securitization retained interests elected under the fair value option were included in this transaction and were part of the premium amount recorded with the loan balances at zions bank see “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 for further discussion of these securities purchased 

estimates of fair value 

the company measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting examples of these include derivative instruments availableforsale and trading securities and private equity investments additionally fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with sfas no 107 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  examples of these nonrecurring uses of fair value include loans held for sale accounted 

  

for at the lower of cost or fair value impaired loans longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets depending on the nature of the asset or liability the company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating the instrument’s fair value these valuation techniques and assumptions are in accordance with sfas 157 

fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants if observable market prices are not available then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measures sfas 157 established a threelevel hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques between observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and unobservable data such as the company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes 

fair values for investment securities trading assets and most derivative financial instruments are based on independent third party market prices or if identical market prices are not available they are based on the market prices of similar instruments if available if market prices of similar instruments are not available instruments are valued based on the best available data some of which may not be readily observable in the market the fair values of loans held for sale are typically based on quotes from market participants the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties less estimated selling costs 

estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value if the carrying amount of the company’s investment in the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount if any by which goodwill is impaired in determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units management uses discounted cash flow models which require assumptions about growth rates of the reporting units and the cost of equity to the extent that adequate data is available other valuation techniques relying on market data may be incorporated into the estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value for longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates the life of the asset andor the fair value of the assets the company tests longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

  

valuation of collateralized debt obligations 

the company values cdo availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities using several methodologies based on the appropriate fair value hierarchy consistent with currently available market information at december 31 2008 the company valued substantially all of the cdo portfolio using level 3 pricing methods as follows 

schedule 3 

cdo fair values 

 

 internal model 

four developments during 2008 influenced the company to use a level 3 cash flow modeling approach to value essentially all of its bank and insurance trust preferred securities at december 31 2008 

 

  

  

   

  

 in the third quarter of 2008 the company began using a licensed third party model to value bank and insurance trust preferred cdos the model uses marketbased estimates of expected loss for the individual pieces of underlying collateral to arrive at a poollevel expected loss rate for each cdo these loss assumptions are applied to the cdo’s structure to generate cash flow projections for each tranche of the cdo the fair value of each tranche is determined by discounting its resultant lossadjusted cash flows with appropriate market based discount rates at december 31 2008 the discount rate determination referenced several market inputs including current collateralized loan obligation spreads obtained from a third party 

the method for deriving loss expectation for collateral underlying the cdos depends on whether the collateral is from a public or private company for public companies a term structure of probabilities of default “pds” is obtained from a commercially available service the service estimates pds using a proprietary reduced form model derived using logistic regression on a historical default database because the service’s model requires equity valuation related inputs along with other macro and firm specific inputs to produce default probabilities the service does not produce results for private firms and some very small public firms that do not have readily available market data 

for private companies and the few small public companies not evaluated by the service pds are estimated based on credit ratings the credit ratings come from two external rating sources one specific to banks and the other to insurers the company has credit ratings for each piece of collateral whether private or public using the pd data on the public companies obtained from the commercial service the company calculates the average pd for each credit rating level by industry the rating level average is then applied to all corresponding credits within each rating level that do not have a pd from the commercial service 

the pds for the underlying collateral are then used to develop cdo deallevel expected loss curves an external service which models the unique cashflow waterfall and structure of each cdo deal is used to generate tranchelevel cash flows using the company’s derived cdo deallevel loss assumptions along with other relevant assumptions the resultant cashflows are discounted using current market spreads approximated from related product markets these spreads differ depending upon the rating agency ratings usually the fitch rating of the cdo with higher spreads being applied to lower rated cdos 

the company did find evidence of one forced trade during the third quarter of 2008 in a tranche of a cdo that is owned by the company the forced trade occurred at a price of 35 of face value this particular deal had amortized down considerably from issuance and the tranche was currently the most senior in the cdo at the time of the trade the underlying collateral consisted of only five bank obligations and a freddie mac zerocoupon principalonly security strip due 2031 two of the five bank obligations were from wells fargo corporation which also has publicly available secondary market trading levels on a similar public trust preferred issuance even under the assumption that all three of the nonwells fargo obligations in the cdo immediately defaulted with no recovery the projected tranche cashflows discounted at the yield of the public wells fargo trust preferred issue resulted in a value of 68 of face value based on this analysis the observed trade at 35 does 

  

not reflect the level at which an informed market participant would value the security as a comparison the company’s model produced a price of 58 the company feels that the difference between the model price of 58 and the above outlined scenario price of 68 reflects an appropriate liquidity discount given the lack of activity in cdo markets compared to publicly traded trust preferred markets this particular security is valued at december 31 2008 by the company at 55 

the following schedule sets forth the sensitivity of the current cdo fair values using an internal model to changes in the most significant assumptions utilized in the model 

schedule 4 

sensitivity of bank and insurance cdo valuations to adverse changes of current model key valuation assumptions 

 

  

   the adverse changes in expected cumulative credit losses resulted in a larger decrease in fair value for heldtomaturity “htm” than availableforsale “afs” securities because the afs portfolio is composed primarily of more senior cdo tranches in general these senior tranches receive accelerated principal payments under scenarios of high credit losses provided that the credit losses do not exceed the available subordination in the cdo deal by contrast more junior tranches which are in our htm portfolio absorb credit losses and defer principal and interest payments upon increasing credit losses 

third party models 

at december 31 2008 the company utilized third party valuation services for sixteen securities with an aggregate amortized cost of 151 million in the assetbacked security “abs” cdo and trust preferred asset classes these securities continued to have insufficient observable market data available to directly determine prices the company reviewed the methodologies employed by third party models this included a review of all relevant data inputs and the appropriateness of key model assumptions these assumptions included but were not limited to probability of default collateral recovery rates discount rates overcollateralization levels and rating transition probability matrices from rating agencies the model valuations obtained from third party services 

  

were evaluated for reasonableness including quarter to quarter changes in assumptions and comparison to other available data which included third party and internal model results and valuations a range of value estimates is not provided because third party vendors utilized point estimates 

dealer quotes 

the 37 million of assetbacked securities at amortized cost are valued using nonbinding and unadjusted dealer quotes multiple quotes are not available and the values provided are based on a combination of proprietary dealer quotes broker disclosure levels vary and the company seeks to minimize dependence on this level 3 source of the 37 million of securities approximately 18 million are aaa rated 

monoline cds spreads 

a total of 72 million at amortized cost of insured securities purchased out of lockhart were valued using the relevant monoline insurers’ credit derivative levels

otherthantemporaryimpairment – debt investment securities 

we review investment debt securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of otti with formal reviews performed quarterly otti losses on individual investment securities are recognized as a realized loss through earnings when it is probable that the company will not collect all of the contractual cash flows or the company is unable to hold the securities to recovery otti losses include credit losses and a discount for liquidity 

the company’s otti evaluation process conforms with the rules contained in emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 9920 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  fsp no eitf 99201 amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 9920  and sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  these rules require the company to take into consideration current market conditions fair value in relationship to cost extent and nature of change in fair value issuer rating changes and trends volatility of earnings current analysts’ evaluations all available information relevant to the collectability of debt securities our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value which may be maturity and other factors when evaluating for the existence of otti in our securities portfolio 

on january 12 2009 the fasb issued fsp eitf 99201 amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 9920  this fsp is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december 15 2008 and shall be applied prospectively the fsp amends eitf 9920 by eliminating the requirement that a holder’s best estimate of cash flows be based upon those that “a market participant” would use instead the fsp requires that otti be recognized as a realized loss through earnings when it is “probable” there has been an adverse change in the holder’s estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously projected which is consistent with the impairment model in sfas 115 

the company recognized pretax otti losses of 3040 million during 2008 and 1086 million during 2007 on investment debt securities all of the impairment for 2008 related to securities valued using level 3 inputs management estimates that approximately 135 million of the impairment for 2008 related to credit impairment 

the decision to deem these securities otti was based on a specific analysis of the structure of each security and an evaluation of the underlying collateral using information and industry knowledge available to the company future reviews for otti will consider the particular facts and circumstances during the reporting period in review 

  

allowance and reserve for credit losses 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios along with other relevant factors these evaluations are inherently subjective and require us to make numerous assumptions estimates and judgments 

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type for commercial loans we use historical loss experience factors by loan segment adjusted for changes in trends and conditions to help determine an indicated allowance for each segment based on individual loan grades these factors are evaluated and updated using migration analysis techniques and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific portfolio segment the other considerations used in our analysis include volumes and trends of delinquencies levels of nonaccrual loans repossessions and bankruptcies trends in criticized and classified loans and expected losses on loans secured by real estate in addition new credit products and policies economic conditions concentrations of credit risk and the experience and abilities of lending personnel are also taken into consideration 

in addition to the segment evaluations nonaccrual loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of 500 thousand or more are individually evaluated in accordance with sfas no 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan to determine the level of impairment and establish a specific reserve a specific allowance may also be established for adversely graded loans below 500 thousand when it is determined that the risk associated with the loan differs significantly from the risk factor amounts established for its loan segment and risk grade 

the allowance for consumer loans is determined using historically developed loss experience “roll rates” at which loans migrate from one delinquency level to the next higher level using average roll rates for the most recent twelvemonth period and comparing projected losses to actual loss experience the model estimates the expected losses in dollars for the forecasted period by refreshing the model with updated data it is able to project losses for a new twelvemonth period each month segmenting the portfolio into nine product groupings with similar risk profiles this methodology is an accepted industry practice and the company believes it has a sufficient volume of information to produce reliable projections 

as a final step to the evaluation process we perform an additional review of the adequacy of the allowance based on the loan portfolio in its entirety this enables us to mitigate but not eliminate the imprecision inherent in loan and segmentlevel estimates of expected credit losses this review of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any adjustments necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and concentration risks 

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses some are quantitative while others require us to make qualitative judgments although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address all of the components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses which would negatively impact the company’s results of operations in future periods as an example if a total of 10 billion of nonclassified loans were to be immediately classified as special mention substandard and doubtful in the same proportion as the existing portfolio of the criticized and classified loans the amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2008 would increase by approximately 64 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in the level of the criticized and classified 

  

loans may have on the allowance estimation process we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the potential losses in the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

we are in the process of developing potential changes to enhance our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses the potential changes include incorporating a twofactor grading system to include probability of default and loss given default we currently anticipate that these changes will be phased in during 2009 regardless of the methodology employed we expect current economic conditions may result in increases to the alll throughout 2009 

reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

the company has historically maintained a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2008 refinements to this process were implemented to include all unfunded commitments including the unfunded portions of partially funded credits which were previously reserved for as part of the allowance for loan losses 

nonmarketable equity securities 

the company either directly through its banking subsidiaries or through its small business investment companies “sbic” owns investments in venture funds and other capital securities that are not publicly traded and are not accounted for using the equity method since these nonmarketable securities have no readily ascertainable fair values they are reported at amounts we have estimated to be their fair values in estimating the fair value of each investment we must apply judgment using certain assumptions initially we believe that an investment’s cost is the best indication of its fair value provided that there have been no significant positive or negative developments subsequent to its acquisition that indicate the necessity of an adjustment to a fair value estimate if and when such an event takes place we adjust the investment’s cost by an amount that we believe reflects the nature of the event in addition any minority interests in the company’s sbics reduce its share of any gains or losses incurred on these investments 

as of december 31 2008 the company’s total investment in nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for using the equity method was 1330 million of which its equity exposure to investments held by the sbics net of related minority interest of 264 million was 392 million in addition exposure to nonsbic equity investments not accounted for by the equity method was 674 million 

the values we have assigned to these securities where no market quotations exist are based upon available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that ultimately will be realized on these securities key information used in valuing these securities include the projected financial performance of these companies the evaluation of the investee company’s management team and other industry economic and market factors if there had been an active market for these securities the carrying value may have been significantly different from the amounts reported in addition since zions bank and amegy are the principal business segments holding these investments they would experience the largest impact of any changes in the fair values of these securities 

accounting for goodwill 

goodwill arises from business acquisitions and represents the value attributable to the unidentifiable intangible elements in our acquired businesses goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs this annual test as of october 1 of each year evaluations are also performed on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place such events could include among others a significant adverse change in the business climate an adverse action by a regulator an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit 

  

the first step in this evaluation process is to determine if a potential impairment exists in any of the company’s reporting units and if required from the results of this step a second step measures the amount of any impairment loss the computations required by steps 1 and 2 require us to make a number of estimates and assumptions in completing step 1 we determine the fair value of the reporting unit that is being evaluated in determining the fair value we generally calculate value using a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies in the western and southwestern states comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash or income flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we use a similar methodology in evaluating impairment in nonbank subsidiaries but generally use companies and acquisition transactions nationally in the analysis 

if step 1 indicates a potential impairment of a reporting unit step 2 requires us to estimate the “implied fair value” of the goodwill of the reporting unit this process estimates the fair value of the unit’s individual assets and liabilities in the same manner as if a purchase of the reporting unit were taking place to do this we must determine the fair value of the assets liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit based upon the best available information we estimate the fair market value of all of the tangible assets identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the associated reporting units in accordance with the principals of sfas 157 loans deposits with maturities and debt are fair valued using standard software and assumptions used by zions in its interest rate risk management processes and using other estimates such as credit assumptions to comply with sfas 157 deposits with no maturities are valued at book value larger occupied properties are appraised while for smaller properties and furniture fixtures and equipment it is assumed that depreciated book value approximates fair market value if the implied fair value of goodwill calculated in step 2 is less than the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit an impairment is indicated and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to the calculated value 

the company applies a control premium to the market comparables pricing metrics used in the model to determine the reporting units’ equity values control premiums represents the ability of a controlling shareholder to benefit from synergies and other intangible assets that arise from control that might cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization based on a review of recent bank transactions within the company’s geographic footprint comparing market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value the company determined that a control premium of 25 was appropriate 

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition changes in revenue growth trends cost structures and technology changes in discount rates changes in stock and mergers and acquisitions market values and changes in industry or market sector conditions 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation for the entire organization effective october 1 2008 and we also rolled forward our goodwill impairment evaluation to december 31 2008 due to company’s performance deterioration and market decline from october 1 2008 this 

  

rollforward resulted in the recognition of additional impairment in the fourth quarter compared to the impairment if only the october 1 analysis had been used step 1 was performed by using both market value and transaction value approaches for all reporting units and in certain cases the discounted cash flow approach was also used in the market value approach we identified a group of publicly traded banks using primarily size location and business mix compared to zions’ subsidiary banks we then used valuation multiples including a control premium developed from this group to apply to our subsidiary banks in the transaction value approach we reviewed the purchase price paid in recent mergers and acquisitions of banks similar in size location and business mix to zions’ subsidiary banks from these purchase prices we developed a set of valuation multiples which we applied to our subsidiary banks in instances where the discounted cash flow approach was used we discounted projected cash flows to their present value to arrive at our estimate of fair value 

upon completion of step 1 of the evaluation process we concluded that potential impairment existed at the company’s nba vectra nsb and p5 reporting units step 2 was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation consultant and the company’s internal valuation resources and resulted in 3538 million of impairment losses all the goodwill associated with nba vectra and nsb and essentially all the goodwill at p5 was determined to be impaired this evaluation process required us to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the company’s reporting units and actual values may differ significantly from these estimates such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would in turn negatively impact the company’s results of operations and the business segments where the goodwill is recorded significant remaining amounts of goodwill at december 31 2008 were as follows amegy – 1249 million cbt – 379 million and zions bank – 20 million 

at december 31 2008 the company’s book value exceeded the market value by approximately 21 billion the company reconciled book equity and market equity values as of december 31 2008 in our yearend evaluation of any potential additional impairment by attempting to identify items priced into the market equity value but not in the book value of the company these reconciling items were based on market expectation of fair value between book and market equity including discounts to the loan portfolio the company’s exposure to lockhart holding unrealized losses related to the offbalance sheet securities and unrecognized and unrealized losses related to htm securities held on balance sheet we believe applying a 25 control premium associated with company or reporting units and the above mentioned factors explains the 21 billion difference between book and market equity values 

we expect that the current disrupted market conditions may require us to evaluate goodwill more frequently including quarterly as the circumstances warrant any differences between estimated fair values and carrying values could result in future impairment of goodwill 

accounting for derivatives 

our interest rate risk management strategy involves hedging the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so as to mitigate adverse effects on the company’s net interest margin and cash flows from changes in interest rates while we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading we consider it prudent to use certain derivative instruments to add stability to the company’s interest income and expense to modify the duration of specific assets and liabilities and to manage the company’s exposure to interest rate movements 

additionally the company executes derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and options forward currency exchange contracts and energy commodity swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies those derivatives are immediately hedged by offsetting derivative contracts such that the company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions the company does not use credit default swaps in its investment or hedging operations 

as of december 31 2008 the recorded amounts of derivative assets classified in other assets and derivative liabilities classified in other liabilities were 6423 million and 1781 million respectively when quoted market prices are not available the valuation of derivative instruments is determined using widely 

  

accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates commodity prices and implied volatilities the estimates of fair value are made by an independent third party using a standardized methodology that nets the discounted expected future cash receipts and cash payments based on observable market inputs these future net cash flows however are susceptible to change due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates most significantly foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as a result the estimated values of these derivatives will change over time as cash is received and paid and also as market conditions change as these changes take place they may have a positive or negative impact on our estimated valuations based on the nature and limited purposes of the derivatives that the company employs fluctuations in interest rates have only had a modest effect on its results of operations as such fluctuations are generally expected to be countered by offsetting changes in income expense andor values of assets and liabilities however the company retains basis risk due to changes between the prime rate and libor on nonhedge derivative basis swaps 

in addition to making the valuation estimates we also face the risk that certain derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges and currently meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of sfas 133 may not qualify in the future as “highly effective” as defined by the statement as well as the risk that hedged transactions in cash flow hedging relationships may no longer be considered probable to occur further new interpretations and guidance related to sfas 133 may be issued in the future and we cannot predict the possible impact that such guidance may have on our use of derivative instruments going forward 

although the majority of the company’s hedging relationships have been designated as cash flow hedges for which hedge effectiveness is assessed and measured using a “long haul” approach the company also had five fair value hedging relationships outstanding as of december 31 2008 that were designated using the “shortcut” method as described in sfas 133 paragraph 68 the company believes that the shortcut method continues to be appropriate for those hedges because we have precisely complied with the documentation requirements and each of the applicable shortcut criteria described in paragraph 68 during 2008 an immaterial amount of hedge ineffectiveness was required to be reported in earnings on the company’s outstanding cash flow hedging relationships in addition the company reclassified a loss of 17 million from other comprehensive income to earnings during 2008 as the hedged forecasted transactions related to certain terminated cash flow hedging relationships became probable not to occur this loss is included in fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss 

derivative contracts can be exchangetraded or overthecounter “otc” the company’s exchangetraded derivatives consist of forward currency exchange contracts which are part of the company’s services provided to commercial customers exchangetraded derivatives are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as the values of these derivatives are obtained from quoted prices in active markets for identical contracts 

the company’s otc derivatives consist of interest rate swaps and options as well as energy commodity derivatives for customers the company has classified its otc derivatives in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the significant inputs to the overall valuations are based on marketobservable data or information derived from or corroborated by marketobservable data including marketbased inputs to models model calibration to marketclearing transactions broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency where models are used the selection of a particular model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market the company generally uses similar models to value similar instruments valuation models require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices yield curves credit curves measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets such as generic forwards swaps and options model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 

to comply with the provisions of sfas 157 the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in 

  

the fair value measurements of its otc derivatives the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives which incorporates both the current and potential future exposure and then applying each counterparty’s credit spread to the applicable exposure for derivatives with twoway exposure such as interest rate swaps the counterparty’s credit spread is applied to the company’s exposure to the counterparty and the company’s own credit spread is applied to the counterparty’s exposure to the company and the net credit valuation adjustment is reflected in the company’s derivative valuations the total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using marketobservable inputs such as yield curves and volatilities for the company’s own credit spread and for counterparties having publicly available credit information the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider for counterparties without publicly available credit information which are primarily commercial banking customers the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations are estimated by the company based on current market conditions including consideration of current borrowing spreads for similar customers and transactions review of existing collateralization or other credit enhancements and changes in credit sector and entityspecific credit information in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk the company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings current threshold amounts mutual puts and guarantees additionally the company actively monitors counterparty credit ratings for significant changes 

as of december 31 2008 the net credit valuation adjustments reduced the settlement values of the company’s derivative assets and liabilities by 125 million and 50 million respectively during 2008 the company recognized a loss of 31 million related to credit valuation adjustments on nonhedge derivative instruments which is included in noninterest income various factors impact changes in the credit valuation adjustments over time including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts as well as changes in market rates and volatilities which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments 

although the company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize level 3 inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties however as of december 31 2008 the company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives as a result the company has classified its otc derivative valuations in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

when appropriate valuations are also adjusted for various factors such as liquidity and bidoffer spreads which factors were deemed immaterial by the company as of december 31 2008 

sharebased compensation 

as discussed in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment  which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values 

the company used the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the value of stock options for all stock option grants prior to 2007 and off cycle stock option grants during 2007 and 2008 the assumptions used to apply this model include a weighted average riskfree interest rate a weighted average expected life an expected dividend yield and an expected volatility use of these assumptions is subjective and requires judgment as described in note 17 

from april 24–25 2008 the company successfully conducted an auction of its employee stock option appreciation rights securities “esoars” as allowed by sfas 123r the company used the results of that auction to value its primary grant of employee stock options issued on april 24 2008 the value established was 573 per option which the company estimates is approximately 24 below its blackscholes model valuation 

  

on that date the company recorded the related estimated future settlement obligation of esoars as a liability in the balance sheet the 2008 stock option expense for these grants was 22 million if the esoars value was 10 lower the expense would be 20 million and if the esoars value was 10 higher the expense would be 24 million additionally the primary grant of options in 2007 was valued with the results of an esoars auction in 2007 the number of stock options granted at the primary grant date on may 4 2007 and april 24 2008 were 963680 and 1542238 respectively or 914 and 608 of the total stock options granted in 2007 and 2008 respectively 

on october 22 2007 the company announced it had received notification from the sec that its esoars are sufficiently designed as a marketbased method for valuing employee stock options under sfas 123r the sec staff did not object to the company’s view that the marketclearing price of esoars in the company’s auction was a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the underlying employee stock options 

the accounting for stock option compensation under sfas 123r decreased income before income taxes by 131 million and net income by approximately 92 million for 2008 or 008 per diluted share see note 17 for additional information on stock options and restricted stock 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where it conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws related regulations and case law in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a quarterly basis if business events or circumstances warrant reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits during 2008 the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 96 million net of any federal andor state tax benefits of this reduction 52 million decreased the company’s tax provision for 2008 and 44 million reduced taxrelated balance sheet accounts the company has tax reserves at december 31 2008 of approximately 66 million net of federal andor state benefits for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions 

pending adoption of accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations “141r” which replaces sfas no 141 business combinations  sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any resulting goodwill and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree sfas 141r will require the company to record fair value estimates of contingent consideration and certain other potential liabilities during the original purchase price allocation expense acquisition costs as incurred and does not permit certain restructuring activities previously allowed under eitf issue no 953 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination to be recorded as a component of purchase accounting sfas 141r also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 and must be applied prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date the company will adopt sfas 141r as of january 1 2009 as required we have not determined the effect that the adoption of sfas 141r will have on our consolidated financial statements but the effect will generally be limited to future acquisitions in 2009 except for certain tax treatment of previous acquisitions 

  

sfas 141r amended sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  and fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  previously sfas 109 and fin 48 respectively generally required postacquisition adjustments to business combination related deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions to be recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill sfas 141r does not permit this accounting and generally will require any such changes to be recorded in current period income tax expense thus after sfas 141r is adopted all changes to valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions established in acquisition accounting whether the combination was accounted for under sfas 141 or sfas 141r must be recognized in current period income tax expense 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests “minority interests” in subsidiaries sfas 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity rather than in the liability or mezzanine section between liabilities and equity upon adoption at december 31 2008 and 2007 the company will reclassify 273 million and 309 million respectively from minority interest to a new line item noncontrolling interests to be in included in shareholders’ equity additionally sfas 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest sfas 160 also requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statement of income of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest currently net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest generally is reported as an expense or other deduction in arriving at consolidated net income sfas 160 is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 and must be applied prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will apply retrospectively the company will adopt sfas 160 as of january 1 2009 as required other than the reclassification described above the company does not anticipate that sfas 160 will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1572  effective date of fasb statement no 157 which defers the effective date of sfas 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 with respect to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities which are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis therefore we have deferred application of sfas 157 to such nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until january 1 2009 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133  which establishes enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities sfas 161 requires contextual discussion of the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments for risk management purposes in terms of primary underlying risk disclosure of volume of derivative activity and enhanced credit risk disclosures also sfas 161 requires additional tabular disclosures of fair value amounts financial performance financial position and gains and losses on derivative and related hedged items the company will adopt sfas 161 as of january 1 2009 as required 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fsp no eitf 0361 determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities  this fsp was issued to clarify that unvested sharebased payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities this fsp also provides guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating securities and compute basic earnings per share using the twoclass method this fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company will adopt the fsp as of january 1 2009 as required 

results of operations 

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest component of zions’ revenue for the year 2008 it was 913 of our taxableequivalent revenues compared to 822 in 2007 and 764 in 2006 the increased 

  

percentage for 2008 and 2007 was mainly due to the impairment and valuation losses on securities which reduced total taxableequivalent revenues by 3171 million and 1582 million respectively on a taxableequivalent basis net interest income for 2008 was up 873 million or 46 from 2007 which was up 1191 million or 67 from 2006 the increase in taxableequivalent net interest income for 2008 and 2007 was mainly due to increased interestearning assets driven by loan growth partially offset by declines of 25 basis points in the net interest margin for 2008 and 20 basis points during 2007 the incremental tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all years discussed and presented 

by its nature net interest income is especially vulnerable to changes in the mix and amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in the interest rates and yields associated with these assets and liabilities significantly impact net interest income see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 110 for a complete discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and associated risk 

a gauge that we use to measure the company’s success in managing its net interest income is the level and stability of the net interest margin the net interest margin was 418 in 2008 compared with 443 in 2007 and 463 in 2006 for the fourth quarter of 2008 the company’s net interest margin was 420 which benefited primarily from the capital investment from the us treasury reduced deposit rates and significantly lower borrowing costs 

the decreased net interest margin for 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from increased nonperforming assets reducing average asset yields loan yields dropping more than deposit rates a decline in noninterestbearing demand deposits competitive pricing pressures and purchases of low yielding lockhart commercial paper average loans and leases increased 42 billion and average money market investments increased 11 billion due to the impact of the capital investment from the us treasury and purchases of commercial paper from lockhart average interestbearing deposits increased 20 billion from 2007 with the increase being driven primarily by higher cost internet money market brokered deposits and foreign deposits average borrowed funds increased 30 billion compared to 2007 primarily due to increased borrowing from the federal home loan bank “fhlb” and the federal reserve average noninterestbearing deposits declined 257 million compared to 2007 and were 243 of total average deposits for 2008 compared to 262 for 2007 

the margin compression for 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from the company’s strong loan growth being funded mainly by higher cost deposit products and nondeposit borrowings a decline in noninterestbearing demand deposits competitive pricing pressures and purchases of lockhart commercial paper higher yielding average loans and leases increased 44 billion from 2006 while lower yielding average money market investments and securities decreased slightly by 324 million average interestbearing deposits increased 32 billion from 2006 with most of the increase in higher cost internet money market time and foreign deposits average borrowed funds increased 850 million compared to 2006 

the company expects to continue its efforts to maintain a slightly “assetsensitive” position with regard to interest rate risk however our estimates of the company’s actual position are highly dependent upon changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates modeling assumptions and the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes 

throughout 2008 the frb lowered the federal funds rate seven times by approximately 400 basis points this decrease had a rapid impact on loans tied to libor and the prime rate as these rates were lowered competitive pressures on deposit rates impeded our ability to fully reprice deposits as the frb lowered rates and rates paid to consumers for their deposits were lowered less than 400 basis points this rate compression between loans and deposits had a negative impact on the net interest margin during 2008 we expect that these competitive pricing pressures may continue into 2009 see “interest rate risk” on page 111 for further information

schedule 6 analyzes the yeartoyear changes in net interest income on a fully taxableequivalent basis for the years indicated for purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans however interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions in addition interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates 

schedule 6 

analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate 

 

  

  in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate changes due to the volumerate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate both increase the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate when the rate increases and volume decreases the variance is allocated to the rate 

  

provisions for credit losses 

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that based on our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks in the portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs and statistical trends and other economic factors see “credit risk management” on page 99 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

for the year 2008 the provision for loan losses was 6483 million compared to 1522 million for 2007 and 726 million for 2006 the increased provision for 2008 resulted mainly from significant deterioration in our credit quality particularly from our exposure to residential land development and construction activity in the southwest with arizona california and nevada being most severely impacted and also weakening in commercial loan portfolios see “nonperforming assets” and “allowance and reserve for credit losses” on pages 104 and 106 for further details net loan and lease chargeoffs increased to 3937 million in 2008 up from 636 million in 2007 and 458 million in 2006 the 3301 million increase during 2008 was driven by increased chargeoffs of 1336 million at nba 689 million at nsb 614 million at zions bank and 387 million at cbt primarily related to residential land development and construction loans including the provision for unfunded lending commitments the total provision for credit losses was 6497 million for 2008 1540 million for 2007 and 738 million for 2006 the provision for loan losses was 2852 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and net chargeoffs for the quarter were 1797 million 

the company’s expectation is that credit conditions will continue to soften in most of our markets due to continued weakening in general economic conditions we expect provisioning and net chargeoffs to continue at elevated levels for at least the next several quarters 

noninterest income 

noninterest income represents revenues the company earns for products and services that have no interest rate or yield associated with them noninterest income for 2008 comprised 87 of taxableequivalent revenues reflecting the 3171 million of impairment and valuation losses on securities which reduced noninterest income for 2008 compared to 178 for 2007 and 236 for 2006 schedule 7 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

  

schedule 7 

noninterest income 

 

 noninterest income for 2008 decreased 2216 million or 537 compared to 2007 the largest component of this decrease was the 1589 million increase in impairment and valuation losses on securities other significant components contributing to the noninterest income decrease in 2008 included loan sales and servicing income income from securities conduit fair value and nonhedge derivative loss and net equity securities gains noninterest income for 2007 decreased 1389 million or 252 compared to 2006 also reflecting the impact of 1582 million of impairment and valuation losses on securities 

service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased 234 million in 2008 and 228 million in 2007 the increase was mainly due to the impact of fee increases across the company and reduced deposit account earnings credits due to lower interest rates the increase in 2007 was mainly due to the impact of fee increases across the company and the acquisition of stockmen’s 

other service charges commissions and fees which is comprised of automated teller machine “atm” fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit card interchange fees cash management fees lending commitments syndication and servicing fees and other miscellaneous fees decreased 29 million or 17 from 2007 which was up 136 from 2006 the decrease in 2008 was principally due to lower lending related fees and official check fees offset by increased accounts receivable factoring fees debit card fees and cash management related fees the cash management fees include remote check imaging fees thirdparty ach transaction fees and webbased medical claims transaction fees the increase in 2007 was primarily driven by debit card fees and cash management related fees the increase was offset by decreased insurance income of 50 million resulting from the sale of the company’s grant hatch insurance agency and certain other insurance assets completed during the first quarter of 2007 

trust and wealth management income for 2008 increased 33 compared to 2007 which was up 217 compared to 2006 the modest increase for 2008 was from slower organic growth in the trust and wealth management business and declines in fees due to lower balances of assets under management primarily as a result of declines in market values of a number of asset classes the increase for 2007 was from organic growth in the trust and wealth management business including growth related to our contango wealth management and associated trust business as well as growth in the amegy trust and wealth management business 

capital markets and foreign exchange include trading income public finance fees foreign exchange income and other capital market related fees and increased 144 from 2007 which was up 104 from 2006 

  

the increase in 2008 was primarily driven by increased trading income partially offset by lower public finance fees the increase in 2007 was primarily the result of higher public finance fees 

dividends and other investment income consist of revenue from the company’s bankowned life insurance program and revenues from other investments revenues from other investments include dividends on fhlb stock federal reserve bank stock and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates including certain alternative venture investments and were 156 million in 2008 230 million in 2007 and 133 million in 2006 the decreased income from other investments in 2008 is primarily due to a 141 million decrease in equity in earnings of farmer mac offset by a 60 million increase in earnings from amegy’s alternative investments program the decrease in earnings from farmer mac is mainly due to their losses in securities holdings in lehman brothers and fannie mae revenue from bankowned life insurance programs was 307 million in 2008 279 million in 2007 and 266 million in 2006 

loan sales and servicing income includes revenues from securitizations of loans gains and losses from sales of loans as well as revenues that we earn through servicing loans that we sold to third parties for 2008 loan sales and servicing income decreased 366 compared to 2007 and decreased 290 between 2007 and 2006 the decreased income for 2008 is mainly due to reduced servicing fees on securitized small business loans upon dissolution of securitization trusts as described in “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 these loans were recorded on zions bank’s balance sheet and not serviced for investors the decrease for 2007 compared to 2006 mainly resulted from lower servicing fees from lower loan balances and retained interest impairment writedowns of 126 million in 2007 these writedowns resulted primarily from higher than expected loan prepayments increased default assumptions and changes in the interest rate environment as determined from our periodic evaluation of beneficial interests as required by eitf 9920 as of december 31 2008 the company had no retained interests in small business securitizations recorded on the balance sheet see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company’s securitization programs 

income from securities conduit decreased 127 million or 698 for 2008 compared to 2007 and decreased 435 between 2007 and 2006 this income represents fees we receive from lockhart a qspe securities conduit the decrease in income is due to the higher cost of assetbacked commercial paper used to fund lockhart resulting from the disruptions in the credit markets which began in august of 2007 and a decrease in the size of lockhart’s securities portfolio the book value of lockhart’s securities portfolio declined to 738 million at december 31 2008 from 21 billion at december 31 2007 and from 41 billion at december 31 2006 due to zions’ required purchase of securities out of lockhart and repayments of principal we expect that the book value of the lockhart portfolio will continue to decrease income from securities conduit will depend both on the amount of securities held in the portfolio and on the cost of the commercial paper used to fund those securities see “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 “liquidity management actions” on page 116 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding securitizations and lockhart 

fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss consists of the following 

schedule 8 

fair value and nonhedge derivative income loss 

 

   

the losses on nonhedge derivatives for 2008 and 2007 resulted from decreasing spreads between libor and the prime rate during the second half of 2007 in an effort to employ the most liquid instrument available for zions’ hedging program and execute transactions with the most economically favorable terms it has been zions’ practice to use libor as the floating index on swaps executed with external counterparties as a significant portion of the company’s loan assets are prime rate floating loans many of the company’s swaps are structured with a prime floating rate in conjunction with the execution of swaps in which the company receives a fixed rate and pays prime zions also executes a swap in which it pays libor plus a spread and receives prime the company therefore has chosen to retain the primelibor basis risk in this hedging activity 

net equity securities gains in 2008 were 08 million compared to net gains of 177 million in 2007 and 178 million in 2006 net gains for 2008 included a 124 million gain on the visa stock offering a 77 million gain on the sale of an interest in a mutual fund management company an 110 million impairment loss on the company’s investment in farmer mac and net losses of 84 million on venture capital equity investments net gains for 2007 included a 25 million gain on the sale of an investment in a community bank and net gains on venture capital equity investments of 154 million net of related minority interest of 54 million income taxes and other expenses venture capital investments contributed 26 million to net losses in 2008 compared to net income of 34 million for 2007 and 41 million for 2006 

impairment losses on investment securities and valuation losses on securities purchased from lockhart were 3171 million in 2008 compared to 1582 million in 2007 the 2008 losses consisted of impairment losses of 3040 million on abs reit trust preferred and bank and insurance trust preferred cdos and valuation losses of 131 million on securities purchased from lockhart during 2007 impairment losses on reit trust preferred cdo securities were 1086 million and valuation losses on securities purchased from lockhart were 496 million see “otherthantemporaryimpairment – debt investment securities” on page 40 “investment securities portfolio” on page 85  and “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 for further discussion 

other noninterest income for 2008 was 156 million compared to 222 million for 2007 and 196 million for 2006 the decrease in 2008 included reduced scanner sales to third party financial institutions the increase in 2007 included a 29 million gain on the sale of the company’s insurance business during 2007 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense for 2008 increased 50 over 2007 which was 56 higher than in 2006 the 2008 increase was impacted by the increased other real estate expense due to the deterioration in the company’s loan credit quality excluding other real estate expense noninterest expense increased 244 million or 17 over 2007 schedule 9 summarizes the major components of noninterest expense and provides a comparison of the components over the past three years

nm – not meaningful 

the company’s efficiency ratio was 675 for 2008 compared to 605 for 2007 and 569 for 2006 the increase in the efficiency ratio for 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to the previously discussed impairment and valuation losses on securities the efficiency ratio was 589 for 2008 and 567 for 2007 excluding the impairment and valuation losses on securities 

salary costs for 2008 increased 42 over 2007 which were up 58 from 2006 the increases for 2008 resulted mainly from merit pay salary increases offset by reductions in variable pay the salary costs for 2008 also included sharebased compensation expense of approximately 318 million up from 283 million for 2007 the increases for 2007 resulted mainly from merit pay salary increases and increased staffing related to other business expansion employee health and insurance benefits for 2008 decreased 105 from 2007 which increased 242 from 2006 employee health and insurance expense for 2008 included an adjustment which reduced expense by approximately 30 million to reflect the elimination of a health insurance benefit retirement expense for 2008 decreased primarily because no accrual was required for the company’s profit sharing plan salaries and employee benefits are shown in greater detail in schedule 10 

schedule 10 

salaries and employee benefits 

 

   

occupancy expense increased 68 million or 63 compared to 2007 which was up 78 from 2006 the 2008 increase was impacted by higher facilities rent expense and higher facilities maintenance and includes 17 million of expense associated with damage to branches and other facilities caused by hurricane ike in the third quarter of 2008 the 2007 increase was impacted by higher facilities rent expense higher facilities maintenance and utilities expense and the impact of the acquisition of stockmen’s 

furniture and equipment expense for 2008 increased 36 million or 37 compared to 2007 which was up 88 from 2006 the increase in 2007 was mainly due to increased maintenance contract costs related to technology and operational assets 

other real estate expense increased to 504 million compared 44 million for 2007 and 01 million for 2006 the increase is primarily due to increased oreo balances and writedowns resulting from declining property values mainly in arizona and nevada 

advertising expense was 307 million in 2008 269 million in 2007 and 265 million in 2006 the increased expense in 2008 included increased internet related advertising expenses 

fdic premiums for 2008 increased 134 million or 2062 compared to 2007 which was up 204 from 2006 we expect this expense to increase in 2009 

other noninterest expense for 2008 decreased 42 million or 18 compared to 2007 which was up 55 from 2006 the increase in 2007 included an 81 million visa litigation accrual and a 40 million writedown on repossessed equipment which was collateral for an equipment lease the visa litigation accrual represents an estimate of the company’s proportionate share of a contingent obligation to indemnify visa inc for certain litigation matters during 2008 the company reduced the visa accrual by 56 million as a result of visa funding a litigation escrow account and settling certain covered litigation 

impairment losses on goodwill 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 2007 and 2006 the company completed the annual goodwill impairment analysis as required by sfas 142 the annual goodwill impairment analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in total impairment losses on goodwill of 3538 million at the nba vectra nsb and p5 reporting units 

the primary causes of the impairment losses on goodwill in three of our reporting units as of december 31 2008 were declines in market values of comparable companies declines in acquisition transaction values and reduced earnings at the reporting units which resulted primarily from deterioration in credit quality of loan portfolios see “accounting for goodwill” on page 42 for further discussion of the goodwill impairment 

foreign operations 

six of our subsidiary banks each operate a foreign branch in grand cayman grand cayman islands bwi the branches only accept deposits from qualified domestic customers while deposits in these branches are not subject to frb reserve requirements or fdic insurance requirements there are no federal or state income tax benefits to the company or any customers as a result of these operations 

foreign deposits at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 totaled 26 billion 34 billion and 26 billion respectively and averaged 32 billion for 2008 27 billion for 2007 and 21 billion for 2006 all of these foreign deposits were related to domestic customers of the banks see schedule 32 on page 93 for foreign loans outstanding 

  

income taxes 

the company’s income tax benefit for 2008 was 434 million compared to income tax expense of 2357 million for 2007 and 3180 million for 2006 the company’s effective income tax rates including the effects of minority interest were 140 in 2008 323 in 2007 and 353 in 2006 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes 

the average effective tax rate in 2008 was lower than in prior years mainly because of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charges also increased securities impairment charges loan loss provision and oreo chargedowns recorded in 2008 affected taxable revenue thereby increasing the proportion of nontaxable income relative to total income during 2008 the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 96 million net of any federal andor state tax benefits of this reduction 52 million decreased the company’s tax provision for 2008 and 44 million reduced taxrelated balance sheet accounts 

during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 122 million net of any federal andor state tax benefits of this reduction 91 million decreased the company’s tax provision for 2007 and 31 million reduced goodwill the primary cause of the decrease was the closing of various state statutes of limitations and tax examinations as a result of the recognition of certain tax benefits accrued interest payable on unrecognized tax benefits was also reduced by approximately 28 million net of any federal andor state benefits since the company classifies interest and penalties related to tax matters as a component of tax expense the reduction in interest on unrecognized tax benefits also resulted in a decrease to the company’s tax provision for 2007 the average effective tax rate in 2007 also was lower than in prior years because the securities impairment charges recorded in 2007 affected taxable revenue thereby increasing the proportion of nontaxable income relative to total income

nonperforming assets were 4124 million at december 31 2008 compared to 450 million one year ago an increase of 3674 million or 8164 this deterioration can be attributed to real estate secured loans which account for 79 of nonperforming loans the ratio of nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2008 was 279 compared to 035 at december 31 2007

provided the credit enhancement on the senior tranche of securitized small business loans a smaller amount of securities were repurchased as required due to downgrades of the securities themselves finally during 2008 zions bank also purchased varying amounts of commercial paper issued by lockhart to fund its assets purchasing these securities and commercial paper contributed to the growth in average earning assets the net interest margin was 377 for 2008 compared to 390 for 2007 and 389 for 2006 the biggest impact on margin compression has been the increase in nonperforming assets and increased cost of deposits

 net income for cbt decreased 641 to 386 million for 2008 compared to 1074 million for 2007 and 1726 million for 2006 the decrease in net income was primarily due to recognition of impairment losses on investment securities increased provision for loan losses and to a lesser extent a decrease in net interest income 

nonperforming assets were 1470 million at december 31 2008 compared to 624 million one year ago an increase of 846 million or 1356 nonperforming assets include 1350 million of nonperforming loans and 120 million of oreo for 2008 compared to 623 million of nonperforming loans and no oreo for 2007 the majority of the increase in nonperforming loans is attributable to deterioration of commercial real estate construction and land development loans cbt experienced moderate increases in nonperforming commercial and mortgage loans the ratio of nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2008 was 187 compared to 080 at december 31 2007

noninterest income increased 522 to 1929 million compared to 1267 million for 2007 and 1149 million for 2006 the largest increases in noninterest income were due to the income received from

the arizona economy has been contracting since the 3 rd quarter of 2007 normally the state’s economy follows the national economy however in this current recession arizona along with many western states lead this decline the decline continued to be fairly severe during 2008 the state’s unemployment grew by over 56 to 61 in the twelve months ending october 31 2008 the state’s population grew slightly in the same twelve month period by 16 to over 64 million however the pace of quarterly net migration into the state slowed to just over 8000 in the third quarter of 2008 nearly a fourth of the level experienced in the same quarter in 2007 statewide residential building permits dropped to just over 27000 a decline of 43 in the fiscal year indications are that 2009 will remain challenging as unemployment is expected to rise to nearly 8 population growth is anticipated to decline to 12 and residential building permits are expected to decline approximately 22 projections for 2010 and beyond reflect a more positive trend although remain modest in comparison to factors experienced by the state during a growth period of 20032006

 nba experienced a net loss of 2186 million in 2008 compared to net income of 678 million for 2007 and 732 million for 2006 the decrease in the net results for nba was primarily due to recognition of goodwill impairment totaling 1686 million as of december 31 2008 all of nba’s goodwill has been written off additionally with the worsening economic trends in arizona as noted above creditrelated costs increased significantly in the year during the year the company recorded a total loan loss provision of 2118 million and nearly doubled to 124 million the allowance for loan losses at yearend 

as clearly reflected in the year’s loan loss provision nba’s credit quality worsened in the year the steady decline in almost every sector of the arizona economy especially notable in the real estate sector caused stress on the bank’s portfolio nonperforming assets were 2730 million at december 31 2008 compared to 761 million one year prior an increase of 1969 million or 2587 the bank’s exposure to real estate lending both commercial and residential contributed to the majority of the increase in nonperforming assets for the year nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2008 was 649 compared to 166 at december 31 2007 

net loan and lease chargeoffs were 1472 million for 2008 compared with 136 million for 2007 and 113 million for 2006 net loan and lease chargeoffs in 2008 were primarily related to the bank’s real estate portfolio including real estate construction land development and land loans the loan loss provision was 2118 million for 2008 compared to 305 million for 2007 and 163 million for 2006 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases was 298 and 142 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

net interest income at nba for 2008 declined by 125 or 313 million as compared to 2007 this decrease resulted from a 45 decline in nba’s average earning assets compression in the net margin arising from a highly competitive marketplace for deposit acquisition and retention and increased nonperforming loans 

  

the net interest margin was 464 for 2008 compared to 508 for 2007 and 520 for 2006 most shortterm benchmark interest rates declined during the year however our ability to reduce customer deposit rates in tandem was hampered by heightened bank competition for liquidity 

noninterest income increased 401 to 468 million compared to 334 million for 2007 and 254 million for 2006 this increase is principally due to the recognition of income from interest rate swaps which became ineffective during the year the bank maintains swap positions to hedge against interest rate risks hedged against certain portfolio loans when these positions are deemed ineffective the swap is cancelled and the income or loss is recognized in noninterest income during 2008 the income from this activity was 144 million compared with a minor loss in 2007 additionally noninterest income includes fees earned from customers on their transaction accounts offset by customer earnings credit with the interest rate market decline the net fees earned by the bank increased bank service charges which include net charges on transaction accounts and other fees increased to 170 million an increase of 155 when compared with 2007 

noninterest expense for 2008 increased 188 million or 132 from 2007 the increase is principally the result of increases in oreo expense of 276 million and increased credit and collection costs of 28 million the increase in oreo expense was primarily the result of continued declines in the value of foreclosed properties other significant components of noninterest expense include salaries and employee benefits occupancy costs and advertising all of which were near or below levels experienced in 2007 the efficiency ratio was 6045 for 2008 as compared to 4990 for 2007 and 4281 for 2006

net loans and leases contracted 439 million or 96 in 2008 compared to 2007 over 75 of this contraction occurred in commercial real estate loans as the bank reduced its exposure to real estate related transactions during 2008 nba expects a similar decrease during 2009 as compared with 2008 due to continued reductions in commercial real estate loan exposure and lack of demand in this sector the allowance for loan losses grew by 59 million for the year taking into account the challenging local economic conditions the bank expects to continue its management and focus its attention on controlling its real estate portfolio exposure while maintaining a positive and growing influence in the commercial sector of the market

the markets in which we operate are heavily dependent on traveltourism and construction during spring 2008 financial conditions in these sectors began to deteriorate dramatically as of december 2008 and compared to december 2007 gaming revenues are down 223 airline passenger count is down 133 and visitor volume is down 102 during the same period in clark county and washoe county nsb’s two biggest market areas residential construction permits have declined 877 and 574 respectively and commercial construction permits declined 550 and 529 respectively these declining metrics have led to an increase in the nevada unemployment rate to 79 at november 2008 compared to 53 one year earlier and a decline in the overall employment numbers of 12 during the same period the consensus outlook for 2009 is that nevada’s economy will remain challenged as residential foreclosures continue to mount and overall consumer spending which correlates to travel and tourism spending is expected to remain suppressed given nationwide higher unemployment and general uncertainty about the economy

 nsb had a net loss of 458 million for 2008 compared to net income of 524 million for 2007 and 711 million for 2006 the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to declining market conditions in the state of nevada as evidenced by increased loan loss provisioning write downs of other real estate owned and a goodwill impairment charge the net interest margin also declined due to an adverse change in the deposit funding mix the relatively lower value of noninterestbearing deposits in a low rate environment and an increase in nonperforming assets additionally nsb experienced several nonrecurring charges related to the acquisition of silver state bank and the planned exit from the 28 grocery store branches 

nonperforming assets were 2220 million at december 31 2008 compared to 442 million one year ago an increase of 1778 million or 4023 the majority of the increase is attributable to deterioration of real estate construction land development and land loans particularly those loans with exposure to the residential market nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2008 was 685 compared to 137 at december 31 2007 nsb expects stress in the loan portfolio to increase in 2009 and for nonperforming assets to continue to increase as market conditions remain challenging 

net loan and lease chargeoffs were 716 million for 2008 compared with 27 million for 2007 and 10 million for 2006 net loan and lease chargeoffs in 2008 were primarily related to construction and land development loans and to a lesser extent declining collateral values underlying residential and multifamily loans the loan loss provision was 1003 million for 2008 compared to 233 million for 2007 and 87 million for 2006 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases was 258 173 and 110 at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively chargeoffs are expected to continue in 2009 especially as nonperforming assets are disposed through sale or writedown 

  

nsb’s net interest income decreased in 2008 by 129 or 235 million due primarily to an overall reduction in the interest rate environment but increases in nonperforming assets also pressured the margin also the majority of growth in our deposit portfolio which is our primary source of funding was in interestbearing deposits such as money market accounts the net interest margin was 443 for 2008 compared to 506 for 2007 and 546 for 2006 

nsb recognized otti losses on investment securities of 20 million in december 2008 the parent purchased the impaired securities at fair value 

other noninterest income increased 301 to 428 million compared to 329 million for 2007 and 312 million for 2006 the majority of the increase is attributable to gains on terminated interest rate swaps totaling 80 million while service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased 15 million or 83 due to management’s focus on reducing service charge waivers and crossselling of treasury management products 

noninterest expense for 2008 increased 261 million or 233 from 2007 the largest driver of this increase was an increase of 118 million in oreo expense management has remained proactive in obtaining updated appraisals and marking down oreo holdings as property values have declined in nsb’s markets other increases for 2008 included a 39 million or 78 increase in salaries and benefits attributed to a modest increase in the number of fte and payroll costs incurred due to the acquisition of silver state bank much of which is nonrecurring additionally salaries and benefits for 2007 included a reversal of certain variable compensation accruals nsb also incurred several nonrecurring nonsalaries charges related to the acquisition of silver state bank and the planned exit from the 28 grocery store branches finally legal and credit collection costs increased along with the increase in nonperforming assets the efficiency ratio was 6896 for 2008 as compared to 5182 for 2007 and 4837 for 2006 

nsb incurred a goodwill impairment loss of 210 million during 2008 due to a decline in market values of banking companies in general and degradation in the shortterm earnings potential of nsb as of december 31 2008 all of the goodwill has been written off 

  

schedule 20 

nevada state bank 

 

 net loans and leases contracted 31 million or 10 in 2008 compared to 2007 the decline was primarily due to reductions in construction and land development loan balances of 129 million due to management’s intent to diversify the loan portfolio and the challenging market conditions present in nevada commercial loans increased 63 million partially offsetting the decline in construction and land development loans management intends to continue this trend of diversifying the loan portfolio into 2009 and expects construction loans to continue to decline 

total deposits increased 210 million or 64 in 2008 compared to 2007 with the majority of growth occurring in savings and money market accounts the ratio of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits was 260 in 2008 and 281 in 2007 with the decline caused by a general slowdown in the real estate industry in nevada and thus many of nsb’s customers carrying lower operating account balances brokered deposits consisted of 603 million of certificate of deposit account registry system “cdars” cd’s at yearend as the bank took back from cdars balances equal to the amount of customer funds placed into them 

total securities declined 218 million or 529 in 2008 compared to 2007 the majority of the decline was caused by the maturity or sale of agency or us government sponsored agency securities the proceeds from the sale and maturity of these securities were generally not reinvested due to balance sheet management considerations 

  

the total riskbased capital ratio at december 31 2008 was 1558 compared to 1105 and 1163 at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the increase in the total riskbased capital ratio for 2008 was mainly due to the issuance of qualifying tier 1 capital preferred stock of 260 million to the parent in december 2008 a 1125 million redemption of qualifying tier 2 capital subordinated debt due to the parent and the net loss of 248 million excluding the goodwill impairment 

vectra bank colorado

the colorado economy has experienced slower growth during 2008 reflecting the impact of the economic downturn on the state job growth has slowed but the state still added 5000 new jobs between november 2007 and november 2008 – an employment growth rate of 02 weaker employment growth resulted in a jobless rate of 58 in november 2008 as compared to 40 a year earlier while home prices have declined in colorado the housing market has faired better than many parts of the nation according to an spcaseshiller measure of home values housing prices in denver the largest housing market in the state fell 52 year over year – one of the three smallest declines of 20 cities nationwide measured in the index most regional economists expect colorado to continue performing better than the nation as a whole while the energy education and health services sectors are expected to grow in 2009 the jobless rate will rise as the construction financial and information sectors continue to deteriorate

vectra bank colorado 

 

   

vectra had a net loss of 1350 million for 2008 compared to net income of 222 million for 2007 and 201 million for 2006 the net loss was due to an impairment loss on goodwill of 1515 million this impairment of all of the goodwill at vectra is due to a decline in market values of banking companies in general and a decrease in the shortterm earnings potential of vectra the writeoff is a noncash accounting adjustment that does not impact operations liquidity or regulatory and tangible capital ratios of the bank additionally the bank recognized a 64 million otti loss on a security during the fourth quarter of 2008 excluding the goodwill and securities impairment charges the bank had a profit of approximately 204 million on core operations this performance also reflects elevated provision levels of 159 million in 2008 as compared to 40 million in 2007 and 42 million in 2006 

given the difficult economic environment credit quality while stressed remained relatively strong at vectra nonperforming assets were 271 million at december 31 2008 compared to 104 million one year ago an increase of 167 million the ratio of nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2008 was 131 compared to 052 at december 31 2007 net loan and lease chargeoffs were 136 million for 2008 compared with 13 million for 2007 and 17 million for 2006 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases was 131 compared to 132 at december 31 2007 and 137 at the end of 2006 

net interest income at vectra increased 69 to 1036 million in 2008 due to a 126 or 271 million increase in average earning assets and a reduction in the cost of funds the net interest margin was 431 for 2008 compared to 453 for 2007 and 473 for 2006 the margin declined during 2008 as yields on earning assets declined while competitive pressures on deposit pricing limited the reduction in funding costs 

other noninterest income increased 64 to 299 million compared to 281 million for 2007 and 268 million for 2006 other noninterest income rose year over year due to higher generation of deposit service fees 

noninterest expense for 2008 decreased 04 million or 05 from 2007 salaries and employee benefits had a modest increase of 08 million or 19 the majority of which related to annual merit increases and a modest increase in staff levels expense increases in other categories were more than offset by a decrease in core deposit intangible amortization in 2008 of 19 million as a result of disciplined expense management the bank continued to improve its efficiency ratio which was 6719 for 2008 as compared to 6878 for 2007 and 6999 for 2006 

  

schedule 22 

vectra bank colorado 

 

 net loans and leases expanded 78 million or 39 to 2065 million in 2008 compared to 1987 million in 2007 the growth was primarily in commercial lending partially offset by declines in commercial real estate loans the bank’s liquidity position improved in 2008 as a result of moderate loan growth and significant increases in deposit balances total deposits increased 375 million or 214 to 2127 million in 2008 compared to 1752 million in 2007 increases in certificates of deposits and brokered funds account for the majority of deposit growth in 2008 reducing the ratio of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits to 216 in 2008 down from 277 in 2007 the bank continues to focus on its relationship banking model supporting its target small and medium sized business and consumer segments by offering full service banking products tailored to meet their needs 

total securities declined 62 million or 188 to 267 million in 2008 compared to 329 million in 2007 the change included the sale of a 13 million cdo security to the parent on which vectra recognized an otti loss of 64 million and normal prepayment and payoff activity on the securities portfolio 

the total riskbased capital ratio at december 31 2008 was 1123 compared to 1054 and 1117 at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the increase in the total riskbased capital ratio for 2008 was mainly due to the issuance of qualifying tier 1 capital preferred stock of 10 million to the parent in december 2008

the pacific northwest economy which normally lags the general us economy by 12 to 18 months entered a recessionary period in the fourth quarter of 2008 as evidenced by job losses across nearly all industry sectors increased unemployment continuing declines in housing prices and home sale activity and weakening in the commercial real estate markets foreclosures have risen dramatically as well as personal bankruptcies 2009 is expected to be a very challenging year in the region 

schedule 23 

the commerce bank of washington 

 

 net income for tcbw decreased 91 to 140 million for 2008 compared to 154 million for 2007 and 142 million for 2006 the decrease in net income was primarily due to a decline in the net interest margin caused by the accelerated drop in the prime rate in december tcbw terminated its ineffective interest rate swap portfolio which resulted in a pretax gain of 20 million tcbw also incurred a 13 million pretax otti charge for a bank trust preferred cdo security 

credit quality was strong for the year tcbw did not have any nonperforming assets at december 31 2008 compared to 02 million at yearend 2007 however some deterioration in other credit quality metrics occurred in the fourth quarter reflecting the rapidly weakening pacific northwest economy 

net interest income at tcbw by 13 million or 37 for 2008 compared to 2007 the net interest margin was 405  for 2008 compared to 441 for 2007 and 453 for 2006 the reduction in the margin and net 

  

interest income was primarily due to the heavy concentration of variable rate loans and securities on the balance sheet resulting in sensitivity to sharply declining interest rates 

other noninterest income increased 760 to 44 million compared to 25 million for 2007 and 20 million for 2006 the increase is due to a pretax gain of 20 million from ineffective interest rate swaps that were subsequently terminated 

noninterest expense for 2008 increased 04 million or 28 from 2007 increases for 2008 included a 03 million increase in fdic insurance and an overall decrease in salaries and employee benefits of 04 million or 38 the efficiency ratio was 3952 for 2008 as compared to 3768 for 2007 and 3838 for 2006

total deposits decreased 5 million or 08 in 2008 compared to 2007 however average deposits increased by 64 or 34 million over the same period the ratio of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits increased to 307 in 2008 from 238 in 2007 partially due to the fdic program to provide unlimited insurance on noninterest bearing demand deposits 

  

total securities declined 127 million or 390 in 2008 compared to 2007 the change was driven by the maturity of short term agency securities no longer needed to collateralize the repurchase agreement portfolio and the parent’s purchase of an impaired security at fair value 

the bank continued to be well capitalized in 2008 with a total riskbased capital ratio of 1332 at 2008 compared to 1346 at 2007 and 1450 at 2006 the modest decline was due to strong loan growth in 2007 and 2008

balance sheet analysis 

interestearning assets 

interestearning assets are those with interest rates or yields associated with them one of our goals is to maintain a high level of interestearning assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum 

interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities and loans and leases schedule 5 which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of the company’s interestearning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields as shown in the schedule average interestearning assets in 2008 increased 108 to 477 billion from 430 billion in 2007 mainly driven by loan growth average interestearning assets comprised 887 of total average assets in 2008 compared with 881 in 2007 average interestearning assets were 923 of average tangible assets in both 2008 and 2007 

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits and commercial paper federal funds sold and security resell agreements increased 1265 in 2008 to 1889 million from 834 million in 2007 the increase in average money market investments is mainly due to assetbacked commercial paper that the company purchased from lockhart during 2008 the average commercial paper purchased from lockhart was 865 million for 2008 compared to 251 million for 2007 also average interestearning balances due from the federal reserve were 315 million for 2008 due in part to the impact of the company receiving tarp funds in the fourth quarter average investment securities decreased 108 for 2008 compared to 2007 average net loans and leases for 2008 increased 113 compared to 2007 

investment securities portfolio 

we invest in securities both to generate revenues for the company and to manage liquidity schedules 26 and 27 presents a profile of the company’s investment portfolios at december 31 2008 schedule 28 presents a profile of the company’s investment portfolios at december 31 2007 and 2006 the amortized cost amounts represent the company’s original cost for the investments adjusted for accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments related to the security and impairment losses the estimated fair values are the amounts that we believe most accurately reflect assumptions that other participants in the market place would use in pricing the securities as of the dates indicated 

schedule 26 presents the company’s assetbacked securities classified by the highest of the ratings from any of moody’s investors service fitch ratings or standard  poors schedule 27 presents the assetbacked securities classified by the lowest of the ratings from any of these ratings agencies during 2008 the company observed greater divergence of ratings on these securities due to more and greater securities downgrades by one or two of the agencies compared to the others the majority of these securities had “negative outlook” or “negative watch” designations by one of more rating agency at december 31 2008

 the amortized cost of investment securities at yearend 2008 decreased 1152 million from 2007 the change was largely due to security sales security paydowns and otti writedowns offset in part by zions bank purchasing securities from lockhart see further discussion of securities purchases from lockhart in “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 as discussed further in “market risk – fixed income” on page 113 changes in fair value on availableforsale securities have been reflected in shareholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income “oci” 

during the second quarter of 2008 the company reassessed the classification of certain assetbacked and trust preferred cdos on april 28 2008 the company reclassified approximately 12 billion at fair value of these availableforsale securities to heldtomaturity the related unrealized pretax loss of approximately 273 million included in oci remained in oci and is being amortized as a yield adjustment through earnings over the remaining terms of the securities on december 24 2008 the company reclassified an additional availableforsale security with a fair value of approximately 51 million to heldtomaturity no gain or loss was recognized at the time of reclassifications the company considers the heldtomaturity classification to be more appropriate because it has the ability and the intent to hold these securities to maturity 

included in assetbacked securities at december 31 2008 are cdos collateralized by trust preferred securities issued by banks insurance companies or reits the reit cdos have some exposure to the subprime market in addition the 135 million carrying value of heldtomaturity and availableforsale “assetbacked securities – other” includes 63 million of certain structured assetbacked collateralized debt obligations “abs cdos” also known as diversified structured finance cdos purchased from lockhart which have nonzions’ originated subprime and home equity mortgage securitizations the 63 million of abs cdos includes approximately 11 million of subprime mortgage securities and 7 million of home equity credit line securities see further discussion of certain cdos held by lockhart in “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 

  

at december 31 2008 1 of the 27 billion of fair value of availableforsale securities portfolio as shown previously was valued at level 1 71 was valued at level 2 and 28 was valued at level 3 under the sfas 157 valuation hierarchy see “fair value accounting” on page 34 and note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value accounting 

the amortized cost of availableforsale investment securities valued at level 3 was 929 million and the fair value of these securities was 750 million the securities valued at level 3 were comprised of cdos for these level 3 securities net pretax unrealized loss recognized in oci in 2008 was 179 million as of december 31 2008 we believe that the par amounts of the level 3 availableforsale securities for which no otti has been recognized do not differ from the amounts we currently anticipate realizing on settlement or maturity see “valuation of collateralized debt obligations” on page 37 for further details about the cdo securities pricing methodologies

nonrated securities 

 

 the assetbacked subordinated tranches shown in 2007 created from the company’s loans were mainly the subordinated retained interests of small business loan securitizations during 2008 zions bank was required to purchase from lockhart senior tranches of these securitizations upon dissolution of related securitization trusts the company recorded the previously securitized loans on its balance sheet as loans see “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 for further information on lockhart and the security purchases although the credit quality of these nonrated securities generally is high it would be difficult to market them in a short period of time since they are not rated and there is no active trading market for them 

loan portfolio 

as of december 31 2008 net loans and leases accounted for 760 of total assets compared to 738 at yearend 2007 and 785 of tangible assets as compared to 770 at december 31 2007 schedule 32 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2008 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in certain cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 111

 during 2008 the company completed a loan classification project and amounts for 2008 and 2007 reflect reclassifications resulting from that project information to reclassify loans for periods prior to 2007 is not available 

net loans and leases increased 28 billion during 2008 compared to 44 billion during 2007 the increase in loans includes 12 billion of loans resulting from the purchase of certain securities from lockhart as discussed in “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 these securities were backed by loans originated or underwritten by zions bank and are reflected on the company’s balance sheet primarily as owner occupied commercial loans loan growth slowed considerably during 2008 at zions bank amegy and vectra cbt experienced modest loan growth during 2008 after contracting during 2007 nba and nsb experienced a reduction in outstanding loans due to very challenging economic times in their markets 

we expect that while net loan growth may continue in 2009 in most of our subsidiary banks growth will continue to be limited at nba nsb and cbt until conditions in the residential real estate sector improve it appears that loan demand may be slowing in many of our markets due to weakening economic conditions and we believe that continued repayments and chargeoffs of residential real estate acquisition and development loans in some markets may offset growth of other loan types and growth in other geographies 

  

sold loans being serviced 

the company performs loan servicing operations on both loans that it holds in its portfolios as well as loans that are owned by third party investorowned trusts servicing loans includes 

 

  

  

  

 the company receives a fee for performing loan servicing for third parties failure by the company to service the loans in accordance with the contractual requirements of the servicing agreements may lead to the termination of the servicing contract and the loss of future servicing fees 

schedule 33 

sold loans being serviced 

 

 the company has securitized and sold a portion of the loans that it originated and purchased in many instances we agreed to provide the servicing on these loans as a condition of the sale schedule 33 summarizes the sold loans other than conforming longterm first mortgage real estate loans that the company was servicing as of the dates indicated and the related loan sales activity as reflected in the schedule sales for 2008 increased approximately 127 million compared to 2007 which were down 154 million from 2006 the company did not complete a small business loans securitization during 2008 or 2007 and also discontinued selling new home equity credit lines originations during the fourth quarter of 2006 during 2008 the company purchased small business securitization related securities from lockhart and upon dissolution of related securitization trusts recorded the related loans on its balance sheet see “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 for further discussion also during 2008 the company completed a “cleanup” call on its home equity credit line securitization small business consumer and other sold loans being serviced totaled 06 billion at the end of 2008 compared to 19 billion at the end of 2007 in addition at december 31 2008 conforming longterm first mortgage real estate loans being serviced for others was 1173 million compared with 1232 million at yearend 2007 

  

although it performed the servicing the company exerted no control nor had any equity interest in any of the trusts that owned the securitized small business and home equity credit line loans as is a common practice with securitized transactions the company had subordinated retained interests in the securitized assets representing junior positions to the other investors in the trust securities see notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on asset securitizations and “offbalance sheet arrangement” on page 96 

other earning assets 

as of december 31 2008 the company had 1044 million of other noninterestbearing investments compared with 1034 million in 2007 the increase in other noninterestbearing investments resulted mainly from increases in bankowned life insurance and increases in nonsbic investment funds 

schedule 34 

other noninterestbearing investments 

 

  

 bankowned life insurance investments increased 22 million during 2008 mainly representing the increase in cash surrender value of the policies which is not taxable since it is anticipated that the bankowned life insurance will be held until the eventual death of the insured employees 

sbic investments decreased 7 million from december 31 2007 due to losses and write downs on investments in our venture funds 

nonsbic investment funds increased 41 million during 2008 primarily as a result of increased investment in funds within new and existing investment commitments and appreciation on investments 

other public company investments declined 26 million during 2008 primarily due to impairment write downs of approximately 110 million on farmer mac and 20 million on insurecom and equity in losses of farmer mac of 118 million 

deposits and borrowed funds 

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company intense competition for deposits during much of the year resulted in core deposit growth lagging the company’s loan growth and also impeded our ability to reprice our deposits as the federal reserve lowered rates during the second half of the year however there were indications of improved deposit pricing and some improvement in deposit growth late in the year 

  

schedule 5 summarizes the average deposit balances for the past five years along with their respective interest costs and average interest rates average noninterestbearing deposits decreased 27 in 2008 from 2007 while interestbearing deposits increased 76 during the same time period 

total deposits at december 31 2008 increased 44 billion to 413 billion or 119 over the balances reported at december 31 2007 core deposits increased 14 billion to 338 billion or 43 compared to 325 billion at december 31 2007 noninterestbearing demand deposits at december 31 2008 increased 01 billion to 97 billion compared to 96 billion at december 31 2007 demand savings and money market deposits comprised 749 of total deposits at december 31 2008 compared with 720 as of december 31 2007 the increase was mainly driven by increased brokered deposits and internet money market deposits during 2008 

during 2008 the company increased brokered deposit programs and internet money market accounts to serve as an additional source of liquidity for the company and reduce its reliance on fhlb advances and other shortterm borrowings at december 31 2008 total deposits included 33 billion of brokered deposits compared to 77 million at december 31 2007 and internet money market deposits were 25 billion compared to 22 billion at december 31 2007 money market brokered deposits comprised 26 billion of the increase in brokered deposits the average balance of brokered deposits was 653 million for 2008 and 77 million for 2007

offbalance sheet arrangement 

the company administers one qspe securities conduit lockhart which was established in 2000 lockhart was structured to purchase securities that are collateralized by small business loans originated or purchased by zions bank such loans were originated during and prior to 2005 lockhart obtains funding through the issuance of assetbacked commercial paper and holds securities which include us government agency securities collateralized by small business loans and aaaaarated securities in november 2008 lockhart elected to participate in the federal reserve’s cpff and as of december 31 2008 had sold 80 million of commercial paper to the federal reserve under this program 

liquidity agreement 

zions bank is the sole provider of a liquidity facility to lockhart pursuant to the liquidity agreement zions bank is required to purchase nondefaulted securities from lockhart to provide funds to repay maturing commercial paper upon lockhart’s inability to access the commercial paper market for sufficient funding or upon a commercial paper market disruption as specified in the governing documents of lockhart in addition pursuant to the governing documents including the liquidity agreement if any security in lockhart is downgraded to below aa or the downgrade of one or more securities results in more than ten securities having ratings of aa to aa zions bank must either 1 place its letter of credit on the security 2 obtain a credit enhancement on the security from a third party or 3 purchase the security from lockhart at book value 

the maximum amount of liquidity that zions bank can be required to provide pursuant to the liquidity agreement is limited to the total amount of securities held by lockhart this maximum amount was 738 million at december 31 2008 21 billion at december 31 2007 41 billion at december 31 2006 and 53 billion at december 31 2005 

in addition to providing the liquidity agreement zions bank receives a fee in exchange for providing hedge support and administrative and investment advisory services to lockhart 

a hedge agreement between lockhart and zions bank provides for the bank to pay lockhart should lockhart’s monthly cost of funds exceed its monthly asset yield due to the extreme dislocation in short term 

  

libor lockhart’s cost of funds exceeded its asset yield for the first time in september of 2008 the spread between lockhart’s monthly asset yield and cost of funds has been volatile as a result of decreasing asset yields and to a lesser extent commercial paper rates resulting from the ongoing contraction disruption and volatility in the credit markets while this spread has again been positive since november it is possible that this hedge agreement may be triggered in the future 

in addition to rating agency downgrades of securities held by lockhart that would require zions bank to purchase securities from lockhart downgrades of lockhart’s commercial paper below p1 by moody’s or below f1 by fitch would prevent issuance of commercial paper by lockhart and result in security purchases under the liquidity agreement 

during 2008 certain assets held by lockhart were downgraded by rating agencies and lockhart was unable to sell varying amounts of commercial paper due to continued deterioration in the assetbacked commercial paper markets these events caused purchases by zions bank of securities from lockhart as follows 

on november 5 2008 ambac assurance corporation was downgraded by moody’s to baa1 resulting in the downgrade of a 78 million security held by lockhart zions bank purchased the security at book value on november 6 2008 and recorded the related pretax writedown of 79 million in adjusting the security to fair value 

on june 19 2008 mbia inc was downgraded by moody’s to below aa and as a result the mbia inc insured assets held by lockhart were downgraded to below aa therefore on june 23 2008 zions bank purchased 787 million of securities from lockhart as required by the liquidity agreement the purchases comprised the entire remaining small business loan securitizations created by zions bank and held by lockhart no gain or loss was recognized on these purchases upon dissolution of the securitization trusts including 87 million of related securities owned by the parent the company recorded 897 million of loans on its balance sheet including 23 million of premium the retained interests related to the securities purchased were included in the purchase transaction and recorded with the premium amount 

on march 5 2008 lockhart was unable to sell sufficient commercial paper to fund commercial paper maturities and zions bank purchased 85 million of mbiainsured securities and a 75 million bank trust preferred cdo from lockhart the mbiainsured securities consisted of securitizations of small business loans from zions bank and their purchase resulted in no gain or loss upon dissolution of the securitization trusts the loans were recorded on zions bank’s balance sheet a pretax writedown of 44 million was recorded by zions bank in adjusting the bank trust preferred cdo security to fair value 

on february 5 2008 a 5 million security held by lockhart was downgraded by moody’s from aa1 to baa1 zions bank purchased this security at book value and recorded the related pretax writedown of 08 million in adjusting the security to fair value in addition lockhart was unable to sell sufficient commercial paper to fund commercial paper maturities and zions bank purchased 115 million of mbiainsured securities from lockhart these securities consisted of securitizations of small business loans from zions bank and their purchase resulted in no gain or loss upon dissolution of the securitization trusts the loans were recorded on zions bank’s balance sheet 

if lockhart is unable to issue additional commercial paper to finance maturing commercial paper or if additional assets of lockhart are downgraded below the ratings described above zions bank will be obligated to purchase additional assets from lockhart because these purchases are transacted at book value zions bank may incur losses if the assets’ book value exceeds their fair value at december 31 2008 the 738 million book value of lockhart’s assets exceeded their fair value by approximately 119 million the company does not expect lockhart’s securities portfolio to ever again exceed 738 million 

  

subsequent event 

on january 14 2009 a 25 million reit trust preferred security held by lockhart was downgraded by fitch from aa to bb zions bank purchased this security at book value under the liquidity agreement the related pretax writedown of 89 million was recorded by zions bank in marking the security to fair value 

assets held by lockhart 

the following schedule summarizes lockhart’s assets by category related amortized cost estimated fair value and ratings 

schedule 35 

lockhart funding llc assets 

 

  

  at december 31 2008 the weighted average interest rate reset of lockhart’s assets was 34 months and the weighted average life of lockhart’s assets was estimated at 178 years the weighted average life of lockhart’s assetbacked commercial paper was 13 days 

possible consolidation of lockhart 

as a qspe currently defined by the provisions of sfas 140 lockhart remains offbalance sheet and is not consolidated in the company’s financial statements should the parent and its subsidiaries together own more than 90 of the outstanding commercial paper beneficial interest of lockhart lockhart would cease to be a qspe and would be required to be consolidated in november of 2008 lockhart sold approximately 10 of its outstanding commercial paper into the cpff the cpff will terminate on october 31 2009 unless it is further extended 

at december 31 2008 lockhart’s assets totaled 738 million at book value and the company owned 412 million of lockhart commercial paper 

if zions bank had been required to purchase all of lockhart’s assets with a book value of 738 million at december 31 2008 including the effect of the fair value loss on those assets its consolidated total riskbased capital ratio as of december 31 2008 would have been reduced by approximately 11 basis points and its consolidated tangible equity ratio as of december 31 2008 would have been reduced by approximately 17 basis points the company has adequate liquidity and borrowing capacity to fund the net additional 03 billion necessary to purchase the lockhart assets if it were required given that the company has 55 billion of assets the potential consolidation of lockhart would not be significant to the company 

see “liquidity management actions” on page 116 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on lockhart 

  

risk elements 

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is integral to those operations and is also a key determinant of the company’s overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower or contractual counterparty to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

credit risk is managed centrally through a uniform credit policy credit administration and credit exam functions at the parent effective management of credit risk is essential in maintaining a safe sound and profitable financial institution we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio further an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to management and to the credit review committee of the board of directors 

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each bank is able to modify corporate credit policy to be more conservative however corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to create a more liberal policy historically only a limited number of such modifications have been approved this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

with regard to credit risk associated with counterparties in offbalance sheet credit instruments zions bank and amegy have international swap dealer association “isda” agreements in place under which derivative transactions are entered into with major derivative dealers each isda agreement details the collateral arrangements between zions bank and amegy and their counterparties in every case the amount of the collateral required to secure the exposed party in the derivative transaction is determined by the fair value on the derivative and the credit rating of the party with the obligation the credit rating used in these situations is provided by either moody’s or standard  poor’s this means that a counterparty with a “aaa” rating would be obligated to provide less collateral to secure a major credit exposure than one with an “a” rating all derivative gains and losses between zions bank or amegy and a single counterparty are netted to determine the net credit exposure and therefore the collateral required we have no exposure to credit default swaps 

the company also has offbalance sheet credit risk associated with a liquidity agreement provided by zions bank to the qspe securities conduit lockhart see “offbalance sheet arrangement” page 96 for further details on lockhart 

the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular property type or with an individual customer or counterparty the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers located within the geographical footprint of its banking subsidiaries see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on concentrations of credit risk 

  

the company’s credit risk management strategy includes diversification of its loan portfolio the company maintains a diversified loan portfolio with some emphasis in real estate as displayed in schedule 36 at yearend 2008 no single loan type exceeded 273 of the company’s total loan portfolio 

schedule 36 

loan portfolio diversification 

 

 in addition as reflected in schedule 37 as of december 31 2008 the commercial real estate loan portfolio is also well diversified by property type purpose and collateral location 

  

schedule 37 

commercial real estate portfolio by property type and collateral location 

represents percentages based upon outstanding commercial real estate loans 

at december 31 2008 

 

  

 loantovalue “ltv” ratios are another key determinant of credit risk in commercial real estate lending the company estimates that the weighted average ltv ratio on the total commercial real estate portfolio at december 31 2008 detailed in yearend amounts in schedule 37 was approximately 57 however continued declines in property values in many of our distressed markets may understate the actual current ltv levels this estimate is based on the most current appraisals generally obtained as of the date of origination downgrade or renewal of the loans 

lending to finance residential land acquisition development and construction is a core business for the company in some geographic markets significant declines in the availability of mortgage financing to buyers of newly constructed homes declining home values and general uncertainty in the residential real estate market are having an adverse impact on the operations of many of the company’s developer and builder customers 

as discussed throughout this document the company’s level of credit quality continued to weaken during 2008 the deterioration in credit quality is mainly related to the weakness in residential development and construction activity in the southwest that started in the latter half of 2007 although not to the degree as experienced in the southwestern states some signs of deterioration also surfaced in utahidaho during the first quarter of 2008 and in the texas market in the fourth quarter of 2008 residential construction and land development loans in arizona and nevada remains the most troubled segment of the portfolio and account for the most meaningful declines in commercial real estate credit quality during the last half of 2008 the company experienced increased criticized and classified loans in its commercial loan portfolio during the year in utah and texas and increased loan delinquencies in segments of its residential mortgage portfolio in utah and idaho we expect continued credit quality deterioration over the next few quarters 

  

the company does not pursue subprime residential mortgage lending including option arm and negative amortization loans it does have approximately 576 million of high fico a credit score developed by the fair isaac corporation stated income loans including “onetime close” loans to finance the construction of a home which convert into a permanent jumbo mortgage this portfolio began to show significant credit quality deterioration in the second half of 2008 

commercial real estate loans 

selected information regarding our commercial real estate “cre” loan portfolio is presented in the following table 

schedule 38 

commercial real estate portfolio by loan type and geography 

at december 31 2008 

 

  

    

approximately 30 of the commercial term loans consist of miniperm loans on which construction is complete and the project is either in the process of stabilization or has stabilized and the owner is waiting to seek permanent financing given the current volatile conditions in the financial markets miniperm loans generally have maturities of 3 to 7 years the remaining 70 are term loans with initial maturities generally of 15 to 20 years stabilization criteria differ by product and are dependent on cash flow created by leaseup for office industrial and retail products and occupancy for retail and apartment products 

approximately 31 of the commercial construction and land development portfolio is designated as acquisition and development most of these acquisition and development properties are tied to specific retail apartment office or other projects underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness of the sponsor the owners’ equity is always expected to be injected prior to bank advances remargining requirements are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow the projected economics of the project are primary in the underwriting because it determines the ultimate value of the property and the ability to service debt therefore in most projects with the exception of multifamily projects we look for substantial preleasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service ratio of 120 

although residential construction and development deals with a different product type many of the requirements previously mentioned such as creditworthiness of the developer upfront injection of the developer’s equity remargining requirements and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan heavy consideration is given to market acceptance of the product location strength of the developer and the ability of the developer to stay within budget progress inspections performed by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made loan agreements generally include limitations on the number of model homes and homes built on a spec basis with preference given to presold homes 

real estate appraisals are ordered independently of the credit officer and the borrower generally by the banks’ appraisal review function which is staffed by qualified appraisers appraisals are ordered from outside appraisers at the inception renewal or for cre loans upon the occurrence of any event causing a “criticized” or “classified” grade to be assigned to the credit the frequency for obtaining updated appraisals for these adversely graded credits is increased when declining market conditions exist advance rates will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor but corporate guidelines generally limit advances to 5065 for raw land 6575 for land development 6575 for finished commercial lots 7580 for finished residential lots 80 for presold homes 7580 for models and spec homes and 7580 for commercial properties exceptions may be granted on a casebycase basis 

loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules rent rolls and on construction projects independent progress inspection reports the receipt of these schedules is closely monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement additionally the frequency of loanbyloan reviews has been increased to a quarterly basis for all commercial and residential land acquisition development and construction loans at california bank  trust national bank of arizona and nevada state bank 

interest reserves are generally established as an expense item in the budget for a real estate construction or development loan it has proven preferable for the borrower to put their total amount of available equity into the project at the inception of the construction rather than holding enough of their available funds to pay the interest during the construction period this enables the bank to maximize the amount of equity obtained and control the amount of money set aside to pay interest on the construction loan the company’s practice is to monitor the construction sales andor leasing progress to determine whether or not the project remains viable at any time during the life of the credit that the project is determined not to be viable the bank has the ability to discontinue the use of the interest reserve and take appropriate action to protect its collateral position via negotiation andor 

  

legal action as deemed appropriate at yearend 2008 zions affiliates have 1898 loans with an outstanding balance of 36 billion where available interest reserves amount to 190 million in instances where projects have been determined unviable the interest reserves have been frozen 

we have not been involved to any meaningful extent with insurance arrangements credit derivatives or any other default agreements as a mitigation strategy for commercial real estate loans however we do make use of personal or other guarantees as risk mitigation strategies 

the company stress tests its cre loan portfolio on a quarterly basis this testing is back tested and the results of the testing are reviewed quarterly with the rating agencies and banking regulators the stress testing methodology includes a loanbyloan monte carlo simulation which is an approach that measures potential loss of principal and related revenues the monte carlo simulation stresses the probability of default and loss given default for cre loans based on a variety of factors including regional economic factors loan grade loantovalue collateral type and geography 

nonperforming assets 

nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans loans restructured at other than market terms other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection consumer loans are not normally placed on nonaccrual status generally closedend nonreal estate secured consumer loans are charged off when they become 120 days past due openend consumer loans are charged off when they become 180 days past due unless they are adequately secured by real estate at which point they are placed on nonaccrual status loans occasionally may be restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments this generally occurs when the financial condition of a borrower deteriorates to the point where the borrower needs to be given temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan oreo is acquired primarily through or in lieu of foreclosure on loans secured by real estate 

as reflected in schedule 39 the company’s nonperforming assets as a percentage of net loans and leases and oreo increased significantly during 2008 the percentage was 271 at december 31 2008 compared with 073 on december 31 2007 and 024 on december 31 2006 total nonperforming assets were 1140 million at yearend 2008 compared to 284 million at december 31 2007 and 82 million at december 31 2006 

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2008 increased 687 million from the balances at december 31 2007 which included increases of 296 million for commercial construction and land development loans 227 million for commercial and industrial and owner occupied loans and 84 million for consumer real estate loans the increase in nonaccrual construction and land development loans was primarily in arizona california nevada and utah reflecting the weakness in residential development and construction activity in those states we expect this weakness to continue in 2009 

  

schedule 39 

nonperforming assets 

 

  

 included in nonaccrual loans are loans that we have determined to be impaired loans other than those included in large groups of smallerbalance homogeneous loans are considered impaired when based on current 

  

information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement including scheduled interest payments the amount of the impairment is measured based on either the present value of expected cash flows the observable fair value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan 

the company’s total recorded investment in impaired loans was 770 million at december 31 2008 and 226 million at december 31 2007 estimated losses on impaired loans are included in the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2008 the allowance included 52 million for impaired loans with a recorded investment of 306 million at december 31 2007 the allowance for loan losses included 21 million for impaired loans with a recorded investment of 103 million see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on impaired loans 

allowance and reserve for credit losses 

allowance for loan losses in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

for commercial loans we use historical loss experience factors by loan segment adjusted for changes in trends and conditions to help determine an indicated allowance for each portfolio segment these factors are evaluated and updated using migration analysis techniques and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific segment these other considerations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the segment evaluations nonaccrual loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of 500 thousand or more are individually evaluated in accordance with sfas no 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan to determine the level of impairment and establish a specific reserve a specific allowance is established for loans adversely graded below 500 thousand when it is determined that the risk associated with the loan differs significantly from the risk factor amounts established for its loan segment 

the allowance for consumer loans is determined using historically developed experience rates at which loans migrate from one delinquency level to the next higher level using average roll rates for the most recent twelvemonth period and comparing projected losses to actual loss experience the model estimates expected losses in dollars for the forecasted period by refreshing the model with updated data it is able to project losses for a new twelvemonth period each month segmenting the portfolio into nine product groupings with similar risk profiles this methodology is an accepted industry practice and the company believes it has a sufficient volume of information to produce reliable projections 

  

as a final step to the evaluation process we perform an additional review of the adequacy of the allowance based on the loan portfolio in its entirety this enables us to mitigate the imprecision inherent in most estimates of expected credit losses this review of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any adjustments necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excessive concentration risks 

the company has initiated a comprehensive review of its allowance for loan losses methodology with a view toward updating and conforming this methodology across all of its banking subsidiaries the company began implementing this updated methodology in 2007 and expects that these changes will be phased in during 2009 

schedule 40 summarizes the company’s loan loss experience by major portfolio segment

summary of loan loss experience 

 

  

   

schedule 41 provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation among the portfolio segments no significant changes took place in the past five years in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment 

schedule 41 

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 

 

 the total allowance for loan losses at december 31 2008 increased 228 million from the level at yearend 2007 for 2008 the increase in the allowance for loan losses for commercial lending reflects 22 billion of loan growth mainly at zions bank and amegy the increase also reflects deterioration of credit quality in this portfolio due to the worsening recessionary economic conditions during 2008 the 76 million increase in the allowance for commercial real estate loans largely reflects the impact of deteriorating credit quality conditions primarily in the residential construction and land acquisition and development portfolios in the southwest and in utah 

reserve for unfunded lending commitments the company also estimates a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is included with other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet with any related increases or decreases in the reserve included in noninterest expense in the statement of income 

we determine the reserve for unfunded lending commitments using a process that is similar to the one we use for commercial loans based on historical experience we have developed experiencebased loss factors that we apply to the company’s unfunded lending commitments to estimate the potential for loss in that portfolio these factors are generated from tracking commitments that become funded and develop into problem loans 

the company has historically maintained a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2008 refinements to this process were implemented to include unfunded commitments including unfunded portions of partially funded credits this action resulted in the reclassification of 279 million from the allowance for loan losses to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments

 interest rate and market risk management 

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates on the company’s net interest income market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company the boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board must understand the key strategies set by management for managing risk establish and periodically revise policy limits and review reported limit exceptions the board has established the management assetliability committee “alco” to which it has delegated the functional management of interest rate and market risk for the company alco’s primary responsibilities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have the net interest margin increase slightly in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being slightly “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise 

we attempt to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and by avoiding large exposures to fixed rate interestearning assets that have significant negative convexity the prime lending rate and the libor curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

we monitor this risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods duration of equity and income simulation in the duration of equity method we measure the expected changes in the fair values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the income simulation method we analyze the expected changes in income in response to changes in interest rates 

duration of equity is derived by first calculating the dollar duration of all assets liabilities and derivative instruments dollar duration is determined by calculating the fair value of each instrument assuming interest rates sustain immediate and parallel movements up 1 and down 1 the average of these two changes in fair value is the dollar duration subtracting the dollar duration of liabilities from the dollar duration of assets and adding the net dollar duration of derivative instruments results in the dollar duration of equity duration of equity is computed by dividing the dollar duration of equity by the fair value of equity 

income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income is measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio 

both of these measurement methods require that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of duration and income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is managed actively to try to maintain a consistent slightly assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

we should note that estimated duration of equity and the income simulation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these estimates we view both the duration of equity and the income simulation results as falling within a range of possibilities 

for income simulation company policy requires that interest sensitive income from a static balance sheet be limited to a decline of no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 basis points 

as of the dates indicated schedule 44 shows the company’s estimated range of duration of equity and percentage change in interest sensitive income based on a static balance sheet in the first year after the rate 

  

change if interest rates were to sustain an immediate parallel change of 200 basis points the “low” and “high” results differ based on the assumed speed of repricing of administeredrate deposits money market interestonchecking and savings 

schedule 44 

duration of equity and interest sensitive income 

 

 the company believes that the dynamic balance sheet changes during 2008 including changes in the mix of deposits and other funding sources have tended to have a somewhat larger effect on the net interest spread and net interest margin than has the company’s interest rate risk position in addition competitive pressures on deposit rates impeded our ability to reprice deposits which had a negative impact on the net interest margin during 2008 market disruptions and funding pressures experienced by many financial institutions kept market deposit prices from falling as much as expected when the federal reserve board began reducing shortterm interest rates finally continued changes in loan pricing spreads and other interest rate behaviors have made it more difficult to implement the company’s normal interest rate risk management activities using interest rate swaps approximately 10 billion of receivefixed interest rate swaps were terminated during 2008 and were not replaced in this period of historically low interest rates at the same time the company’s subsidiary banks made increasing use of interest rate floors on new loans as a result the company ended 2008 with an interest rate risk position that was more assetsensitive than at the end of 2007 as shown in schedule 44 

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at the end of 2008 approximately 78 of the company’s commercial loan and commercial real estate portfolios were floating rate and primarily tied to either prime or libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have floating interest rates this means that these loans reprice quickly in response to changes in interest rates – more quickly on average than does their funding base this posture results in a natural position that is more “assetsensitive” than the company believes is desirable 

the company attempts to mitigate this tendency toward asset sensitivity through the use of interest rate floors on loans to protect against declining rates and more importantly through the use of interest rate swaps we have also contracted to convert most of the company’s longterm fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt through the use of interest rate swaps see “fair value hedges” in schedule 45 more importantly we engage in an ongoing program of swapping primebased and liborbased loans for “receivefixed” contracts at yearend 2008 the company had a notional amount of approximately 24 billion of such cash flow hedge contracts this notional amount is approximately 10 billion less than at yearend 2007 this reduction primarily reflects the termination of a number of swaps in 2008 and the company’s decision not to replace those swaps in a historically low interest rate environment these swaps also expose the company to counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk the company’s approach to managing this risk is discussed in “credit risk management” on page 99 the company retains basis risk due to changes between the prime rate and libor on nonhedge derivative basis swaps see “accounting for derivatives” on page 44 for further details about our derivative instruments

market risk – fixed income 

the company engages in the underwriting and trading of municipal and corporate securities this trading activity exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities held by the company 

at december 31 2008 trading account assets had been reduced to 421 million and securities sold not yet purchased were 357 million 

at yearend 2008 the company made a market in 480 fixed income securities through zions bank and its whollyowned subsidiary zions direct inc during 2008 62 of all trades were executed electronically the company is an oddlot securities dealer which means that most corporate security trades are for less than 250000 

  

the company is exposed to market risk through changes in fair value and otti of htm and afs securities the company also is exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in fair value in availableforsale securities and interest rate swaps are included in oci each quarter during 2008 the aftertax change in oci attributable to afs securities was 112 million the aftertax change in oci attributable to htm securities transferred from afs in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2008 was 1239 million the change attributable to interest rate swaps was 1314 million for a net decrease to shareholders’ equity of 37 million if any of the afs securities or htm securities transferred from afs becomes other than temporarily impaired any loss in oci is reversed and the impairment is charged to operations see “investment securities portfolio” on page 85 for additional information on otti 

market risk – equity investments 

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded and subject to fluctuations in their market prices or values in addition the company owns equity securities in companies that are not publicly traded that are accounted for under cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs in any case the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since the fair value of these securities may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss these equity investments are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

the company also invests in prepublic venture capital companies through various venture funds net of expenses income tax effects and minority interest losses were 30 million in 2008 and gains were 39 million in 2007 and 40 million in 2006 from these venture funds the company’s remaining equity exposure to these venture funds net of related minority interest at december 31 2008 was approximately 544 million compared to approximately 640 million at december 31 2007 

in addition to the program described above amegy has in place an alternative investments program these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds generally are not part of the strategy since the underlying companies are typically not credit worthy the carrying value of the investments at december 31 2008 was 546 million compared to 374 million at december 31 2007 the company has a total remaining nonfinancial funding commitment of 1002 million to sbic nonsbic funds and private equity investments as of december 31 2008 771 million of this total funding commitment is at amegy 

the company also from time to time either starts and funds businesses of a strategic nature or makes significant investments in companies of strategic interest these investments may result in either minority or majority ownership positions and usually give the parent or its subsidiaries board representation these strategic investments are in companies that are financial services or financial technologies providers examples include contango and netdeposit which are majority or whollyowned by the company and insurecom and identrust in which the company owns significant but minority positions 

liquidity risk 

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

  

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy that is adhered to by the parent and the subsidiary banks this policy includes guidelines by which liquidity and funding are managed these guidelines address maintaining liquidity needs diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and bank subsidiaries 

managing liquidity and funding is performed centrally by zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for making any recommended changes to existing funding plans as well as to the policy guidelines these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and potentially to the company’s board of directors the subsidiary banks only have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and the federal reserve and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank andor correspondent banks the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer but are not involved in any other funding decision processes 

contractual obligations 

schedule 46 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2008 

schedule 46 

contractual obligations 

 

  

      

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in the previous schedule the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive cash or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change for further information on derivative contracts see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity management actions 

the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes and dividends to preferred and common shareholders including the cpp preferred equity issued to the treasury the parent’s cash needs are routinely met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes management and other fees equity contributed through the exercise of stock options commercial paper and longterm debt and equity issuances the parent also maintains internal backup liquidity lines with several of its subsidiary banks that are secured by pledged collateral the subsidiary banks’ primary source of funding is their core deposits operational cash flows while constituting a funding source for the company are not large enough to provide funding in the amounts that fulfill the needs of the parent and the bank subsidiaries for 2008 operations contributed 1174 million toward these needs as a result the company utilizes other sources at its disposal to manage its liquidity needs 

during 2008 the parent received 106 million in cash dividends from various subsidiaries at december 31 2008 the banking subsidiaries could pay 374 million of dividends to the parent under regulatory guidelines without the need for regulatory approval the amounts of dividends the banking subsidiaries can pay to the parent are restricted by earnings retained earnings and riskbased capital requirements this source of funding to the parent may become more limited or even unavailable if the operating performance of subsidiary banks deteriorates under continued weak economic conditions or changes in regulation or law see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of dividend capacities and limitations 

for the year 2008 issuances of senior mediumterm debt exceeded repayments of longterm debt resulting in net cash inflows of 109 million as follows 

 

  

  

 on january 15 2009 we issued approximately 255 million of senior floating rate notes due june 21 2012 at a coupon rate of threemonth libor plus 37 basis points the debt is guaranteed under the fdic’s tlgp that became effective on november 21 2008 

see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of the company’s longterm borrowings 

  

on a consolidated basis repayments of shortterm borrowings exceeded fundings excluding shortterm fhlb borrowings and resulted in a 2367 million use of cash in 2008 the parent has a program to issue shortterm commercial paper however current market conditions have severely constrained activity in this program and at december 31 2008 outstanding commercial paper was 15 million 

the parent has secured revolving credit facilities totaling 395 million with five subsidiary banks these revolving credit facilities are limited to the total of pledged securities owned by the parent and municipal securities owned by a nonbank subsidiary and hypothecated to the parent no amount was outstanding on these facilities at december 31 2008 

access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is directly tied to the credit ratings they receive from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the parent and its three largest banking subsidiaries had the following ratings as of december 31 2008 

schedule 47

nr – not rated 

on february 28 2008 moody’s downgraded its ratings for the parent on longterm issuersenior debt to a3 on subordinated debt to baa1 and on shorttermcommercial paper to p2 it also changed its outlook from negative to stable also moody’s downgraded its ratings for the three largest banking subsidiaries on longterm issuersenior debt and certificate of deposit to a2 affirmed the shorttermcommercial paper rating of p1 and changed its outlook from negative to stable 

on august 11 2008 moody’s changed its rating outlook to watch negative for the parent and the three largest subsidiary banks on december 3 2008 moody’s reaffirmed its current ratings and changed its longterm issuer ratings outlook to outlook negative for the parent on september 3 2008 sp reaffirmed its current ratings and changed its long term issuer ratings outlook to outlook negative for the parent and the largest subsidiary bank 

the subsidiaries’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2008 these core deposits in aggregate constituted 819 of consolidated deposits compared with 879 of consolidated deposits at 

  

december 31 2007 at december 31 2008 total brokered deposits were 33 billion up from 77 million at december 31 2007 for 2008 deposit increases resulted in net cash inflows of 3662 million which primarily resulted from a 3192 million increase in brokered deposits 

on october 3 2008 the fdic increased deposit insurance to 250000 through december 31 2009 in addition the fdic implemented a program to provide full deposit insurance coverage for noninterestbearing transaction deposit accounts through december 31 2009 unless insured banks elect to opt out of the program the company did not opt out of this program 

the fhlb system is a significant source of liquidity for the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank and tcbw are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nba are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity requirements for 2008 the activity in shortterm fhlb borrowings resulted in a net cash outflow of 2725 million amounts of unused lines of credit available for additional fhlb advances totaled 88 billion at december 31 2008 borrowings from the fhlb may increase in the future depending on availability of funding from other sources such as deposits the subsidiary banks must maintain their fhlb memberships to continue accessing this source of funding the company is aware of recent news reports and fhlb member bank press releases regarding the financial strength of the fhlb system the company is actively monitoring its ability to borrow from the fhlb banks and took actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 to reduce its borrowings from the fhlb banks 

in december 2007 the federal reserve board announced a new program the term auction facility “taf” to make 28 day loans to banks in the united states and to foreign banks through foreign central banks these loans are made using an auction process zions bank is currently participating in the taf and may continue to do so as long as money can be borrowed at an attractive rate the amount that can be borrowed is based upon the amount of collateral that has been pledged to the federal reserve bank at december 31 2008 18 billion in borrowings were outstanding under this program as compared to 450 million at december 31 2007 however by february 13 2009 the taf borrowings outstanding had been reduced to 500 million at december 31 2008 the amount available for additional federal reserve borrowings was approximately 43 billion which had increased to 57 billion by february 13 2009 an additional 13 billion could be borrowed at december 31 2008 upon the pledging of additional available collateral 

at december 31 2008 the company’s subsidiary banks had a total of 131 billion of immediately available unused borrowing capacity at the fed and various fhlbs which had increased to 143 billion as of february 13 2009 

zions bank has in prior years used asset securitizations to sell loans and provide a flexible alternative source of funding as a qspe securities conduit sponsored by zions bank lockhart has purchased and held creditenhanced securitized assets resulting from certain small business loan securitizations zions bank provides a liquidity facility to lockhart for a fee lockhart purchases floatingrate us government and aaarated securities with funds from the issuance of commercial paper 

due to the disruptions in the assetbacked commercial paper markets that began in august 2007 and continued into 2008 lockhart was unable to issue commercial paper sufficient to fund its assets and the company and its subsidiary banks purchased lockhart commercial paper and held it on their balance sheets the company was also required to purchase assets under the liquidity agreement due to security ratings downgrades and the inability of lockhart to issue commercial paper see “offbalance sheet arrangement” beginning on page 96 for information about lockhart and the liquidity agreement this includes details of the purchase of commercial paper and securities and the possible effect on the company’s liquidity and capital ratios if lockhart was required to be consolidated or the company was required to purchase its remaining securities in november 2008 lockhart also diversified its funding sources by electing to participate in the federal reserve’s cpff program and at december 31 2008 had 80 million outstanding under the program the cpff program currently is scheduled to terminate on october 31 2009 

  

while not considered a primary source of funding the company’s investment activities can also provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture that is being observed for 2008 investment securities activities resulted in net cash inflows of 08 billion 

maturing balances in the various loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows in most cases however loan growth has resulted in net cash outflows from a funding standpoint for 2008 loan growth resulted in a net cash outflow of 25 billion compared to 39 billion in 2007 we expect that loans will continue to be a use of funding rather than a source in 2009 

operational risk management 

operational risk is the potential for unexpected losses attributable to human error systems failures fraud or inadequate internal controls and procedures in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has created a corporate risk management department whose responsibility is to help company management identify and assess key risks and monitor the key internal controls and processes that the company has in place to mitigate operational risk we have documented controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

to manage and minimize its operating risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments in addition reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we maintain contingency plans and systems for operations support in the event of natural or other disasters efforts are continually underway to improve the company’s oversight of operational risk including enhancement of riskcontrol self assessments and of antifraud measures 

capital management 

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company and its subsidiary banks other major cmc responsibilities include 

 

  

 the cmc in managing the capital of the company may set capital standards that are higher than those approved by the board but may not set lower limits 

the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

 

  

  

   

 see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on riskbased capital 

during 2008 the company took several actions to raise additional capital in order to maintain a strong capital position as follows 

 

  

  

 these actions increased total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2008 to 65 billion an increase of 228 over the 53 billion at december 31 2007 tangible equity including preferred stock was 47 billion at the end of 2008 and 31 billion at the end of 2007 tangible common equity was 31 billion an increase of 86 from 29 billion at yearend 2007 

as of december 31 2008 the company had 563 million of remaining authorization from its board of directors for the repurchase of common stock the company has not repurchased any shares since august 2007 and in compliance with the conditions of the capital purchase program the company will not repurchase any common shares during the period the senior preferred shares are outstanding without permission from the us department of the treasury 

  

during its january 2009 meeting the board of directors declared a dividend of 004 per common share payable on february 25 2009 to shareholders of record on february 11 2009 this is a reduction from the prior quarter dividend of 032 per common share the company paid dividends in 2008 of 161 per common share compared with 168 per share in 2007 and 147 per share in 2006 under the terms of the capital purchase program the company may not increase the dividend on its common stock above 032 per share per quarter during the period the senior preferred shares are outstanding without permission from the us department of the treasury 

the company paid 1739 million in dividends on common stock in 2008 and used 29 million to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock 

the company recorded preferred stock dividends of 244 million during 2008 compared to 143 million during 2007 

the company has not stated target capital ratio levels for the period when more normal financial conditions resume but has stated 1 that its longterm target range is likely to be higher than the previously articulated tangible equity target range of 625 to 650 and 2 that during current distressed financial market and economic conditions the company believes that maintaining capital ratios above that range is appropriate the company’s capital ratios were as follows at december 31 2008 and 2007 

schedule 48 

capital ratios 

 

  

 the increased capital ratios at december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 reflect the impact of the issuance of common and preferred stock during the year offset by loan growth increased after tax unrealized losses of 1352 million on investment securities included in oci and the net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2008 the parent and its subsidiary banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios as of december 31 2008 the company and each of its subsidiary banks exceeded the “well capitalized” guidelines under regulatory standards 

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskcapital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply in january 2001 the bcbs released a proposal to replace basel i with a new capital framework “basel ii” that would set capital requirements for operational risk and materially change the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures operational risk is defined by the proposal as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events basel i does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 

  

in september 2006 the us banking regulators issued an interagency advance notice of proposed rulemaking “npr” with regard to the us implementation of the basel ii framework published in december 2007 the final rule requires banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” we are not an “opt in” bank holding company as the company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt the advanced approach however we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to companies that do adopt the advanced approach may make it necessary for the company to elect to “opt in” at some point and we have begun investing in the required capabilities and required data whether or not this scenario emerges our risk management will be well served by our continuing investment in more sophisticated analytical capabilities and in an enhanced data environment 

in july 2008 the us banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would provide “noncore” banks with the option to adopt the standardized approach proposed in basel ii replacing the previously proposed basel 1a framework while the advanced approach uses sophisticated mathematical models to measure and assign capital to specific risks the standardized approach categorizes risks by type and then assigns capital requirements we are evaluating the benefit of adopting the standardized approach 

however in the nearterm we believe that capital issued under the cpp and the potential for capital to be issued after a regulatory “stress test” administered pursuant to arra may override any consideration of any basel ii capital approach

the primary factors in competing for business include pricing convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered and the level of service delivered the company must compete effectively along all of these parameters to remain successful 

  

supervision and regulation 

  

the parent is a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company under the bhc act the grammleachbliley act of 1999 “the glb act” provides a regulatory framework for financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the federal reserve board “frb” the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company the parent must satisfy certain ongoing criteria 

  

in addition the company’s subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or the banking laws of their respective states as well as the rules and regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” they are also under the supervision of and are subject to periodic examination by the occ or their respective state banking departments the frb and the fdic many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the securities and exchange commission “sec” financial industry regulatory authority “finra” andor state securities regulators our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states in which they conduct business 

  

the company is subject to various requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate these regulations include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply the bcbs has been working for a number of years on revisions to basel i and in june 2004 released the final version of its proposed new capital framework “basel ii” with an update in november 2005 basel ii provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk – an internal ratingsbased approach tailored to individual institutions’ circumstances which for many asset classes is itself broken into a “foundation” approach and an “advanced” or “airb” approach the availability of which is subject to additional restrictions and a standardized approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in existing riskbased capital guidelines basel ii also sets capital requirements for operational risk and refines the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures however us regulatory authorities consistently have taken the position that us banks would not be permitted to utilize the “foundation” approach operational risk is defined to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events basel i does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 

  

in december 2007 us banking regulators published the final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or on balance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” we do not currently expect to be an early “opt in” bank holding company as the company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt the advanced approach however we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to companies that do adopt the advanced approach may make it necessary for the company to elect to “opt in” at some point and we have begun investing in the required capabilities and required data 

  

also in july 2007 the us banking regulators agreed to issue a proposed rule that would provide “noncore” banks with the option of adopting the standardized approach proposed in basel ii replacing the previously proposed basel 1a framework while the advanced approach uses sophisticated mathematical models to measure and assign capital to specific risks the standardized approach categorizes risks by type and then assigns capital requirements following the publication of the proposed rule the company will evaluate the benefit of adopting the standardized approach 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the parent is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company quoted on the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” global select market the parent is subject to nasdaq listing standards for quoted companies 

  

the company is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which addresses among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

  

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a system of strong corporate governance practices this system includes corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct and charters for the audit credit review compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

  

the company has adopted policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the company the company intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

  

regulators congress and state legislatures continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

  

government monetary policies 

  

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by fiscal and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect shortterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit the methods of monetary policy available to the frb include 

  

   

   

   

   

these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

  

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the company including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

more recently us banking regulators issued the final rule which requires banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” we do not currently expect to be an early “opt in” bank holding company however our initial analysis indicates that a significant risk of competitive inequity may exist between banks operating under basel ii and those not using basel ii by potentially allowing basel ii banks to operate with lower levels of capital for certain lines of business 

  

   

the company’s board of directors established an enterprisewide risk management policy and appointed an enterprise risk management committee in late 2005 to oversee and implement the policy in addition to credit and interest rate risk the committee also monitors the following risk areas market risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk information technology risk strategic risk and reputation risk

executive summary 

  

company overview 

  

zions bancorporation “the parent” and subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 53 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is the twentythird largest domestic bank holding company in terms of deposits operating banking businesses through 508 domestic branches and 627 atms in ten western and southwestern states arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah and washington our banking businesses include zions first national bank “zions bank” in utah and idaho california bank  trust “cbt” amegy corporation “amegy” and its subsidiary amegy bank in texas national bank of arizona “nba” nevada state bank “nsb” vectra bank colorado “vectra” in colorado and new mexico the commerce bank of washington “tcbw” and the commerce bank of oregon “tcbo” 

  

the company also operates a number of specialty financial services and financial technology businesses that conduct business on a regional or national scale the company is a national leader in small business administration “sba” lending public finance advisory services and software sales and cash management services related to “check 21 act” electronic imaging and clearing of checks in addition zions is included in the sp 500 and nasdaq financial 100 indices 

  

in operating its banking businesses the company seeks to combine the advantages that it believes can result from decentralized organization and branding with those that can come from centralized risk management capital management and operations in its specialty financial services and technology businesses the company seeks to develop a competitive advantage in a particular product customer or technology niche 

  

banking businesses 

  

as shown in charts 1 and 2 the company’s loans and core deposits are widely diversified among the banking franchises the company operates 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

we believe that the company distinguishes itself by having a strategy for growth in its banking businesses that is unique for a bank holding company of its size this growth strategy is driven by four key factors 1 focus on high growth markets 2 keep decisions that affect customers local 3 centralize technology and operations to achieve economies of scale and 4 centralize and standardize policies and management controlling key risks 

  

focus on high growth markets 

  

each of the states in which the company conducts its banking businesses has experienced relatively high levels of historical economic growth and each ranks among the top onethird of states as ranked by population and household income growth projected by the us census bureau despite slowdowns in population employment and key indicators of economic growth in some of these markets in 2007 which is expected to persist through much of 2008 the company believes that over the medium to longer term all of these markets will continue to be among the fastest growing in the country 

  

schedule 1 

  

demographic profile 

by state 

  

   

    

the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in these banking markets within each of the states where the company operates we focus on the market segments that we believe present the best opportunities for us we believe that these states over time have experienced higher rates of growth business formation and expansion than other states we also believe that these states will continue to experience higher rates of commercial real estate development as businesses provide housing shopping business facilities and other amenities for their growing populations as a result a common focus of all of zions’ subsidiary banks is small and middle market business banking including the personal banking needs of the executives and employees of those businesses and commercial real estate development in many cases the company’s relationship with its customers is primarily driven by the goal to satisfy their needs for credit to finance their expanding business opportunities in addition to our commercial business we also provide a broad base of consumer financial products in selected markets including home mortgages home equity lines auto loans and credit cards this mix of business often leads to loan balances growing faster than internally generated deposits this was particularly true in much of 2007 as loan growth significantly outpaced low cost deposit growth in addition it has important implications for the company’s management of certain risks including interest rate and liquidity risks which are discussed further in later sections of this document 

  

keep decisions that affect customers local 

  

the company operates eight different communityregional banks each under a different name and each with its own charter chief executive officer and management team this structure helps to ensure that decisions related to customers are made at a local level in addition each bank controls among other things most decisions related to its branding market strategies customer relationships product pricing and credit decisions within the limits of established corporate policy in this way we are able to differentiate our banks from much larger “mass market” banking competitors that operate regional or national franchises under a common brand and often around “vertical” product silos we believe that this approach allows us to attract and retain exceptional management and that it also results in providing service of the highest quality to our targeted customers in addition we believe that over time this strategy generates superior growth in our banking businesses 

  

centralize technology and operations to achieve economies of scale 

  

we seek to differentiate the company from smaller banks in two ways first we use the combined scale of all of the banking operations to create a broad product offering without the fragmentation of systems and operations that would typically drive up costs second for certain products for which economies of scale are believed to be important the company “manufactures” the product centrally or outsources it from a third party examples include cash management credit card administration mortgage servicing and deposit operations in this way the company seeks to create and maintain efficiencies while generating superior growth 

  

centralize and standardize policies and management controlling key risks 

  

we seek to standardize policies and practices related to the management of key risks in order to assure a consistent risk profile in an otherwise decentralized management model among these key risks and functions are credit interest rate liquidity and market risks although credit decisions are made locally within each affiliate bank these decisions are made within the framework of a corporate credit policy that is standard among all of our affiliate banks each bank may amend the policy in a more conservative direction however it may not amend the policy in a more liberal direction in that case it must request a specific waiver from the company’s chief credit officer in practice only a limited number of waivers have been granted similarly the credit examination function is a corporate activity reporting to the credit review committee of the board of directors and administratively reporting to the director of enterprise risk management who reports to the company’s ceo this assures a reasonable consistency of loan quality grading and loan loss reserving practices among all affiliate banks 

  

interest rate risk management liquidity and market risk and portfolio investments also are managed centrally by a boarddesignated asset liability management committee pursuant to corporate policies regarding interest rate risk liquidity investments and derivatives 

  

internal audit also is a centralized corporate function reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors and administratively reporting to the director of enterprise risk management who reports to the company’s ceo 

  

finally the board established an enterprise risk management committee in late 2005 which is supported by the director of enterprise risk management this committee seeks to monitor and mitigate as appropriate these and other key operating and strategic risks throughout the company 

  

management’s overview of 2007 performance 

  

the company’s primary or “core” business consists of providing community and regional banking services to both individuals and businesses in ten western and southwestern states we believe that this core banking business performed well in many markets during 2007 but came under considerable stress in the second half of the year as residential housing markets deteriorated significantly particularly in arizona california and nevada this deterioration adversely affected the company’s residential land acquisition development and construction related business its loans to these business activities in these markets comprise approximately six percent of the company’s total loan portfolio 

  

despite credit quality deterioration and the virtual cessation of net organic loan growth in our banks in these three states the company experienced strong loan growth of 128 most of our growth in 2007 was organic however on january 17 2007 we also acquired stockmen’s bancorp inc “stockmen’s” a bank holding company with 12 billion in assets headquartered in kingman arizona stockmen’s parent company was merged into the parent and stockmen’s banking subsidiary was merged into our nba affiliate bank on november 2 2007 the company sold 11 stockmen’s branches located in california which included 169 million of loans and 190 million of deposits during the year the company explored other acquisition opportunities throughout its current geographical area markets but only completed the stockmen’s acquisition and the acquisition of intercontinental bank shares corporation “intercon” in texas with 115 million in assets through the first half of the year the company generally found that the prices being sought by potential sellers were too high to allow the company to create significant value for its shareholders through bank acquisitions later as some of its key markets weakened the company did not pursue certain opportunities because of the difficulty in quantifying potential risks in a rapidly changing banking environment the company believes that current economic stresses affecting a number of banking companies may result in more potential acquisition opportunities at more reasonable prices later in 2008 and beyond but this cannot be assured 

  

the company reported earnings for 2007 of 4794 million or 442 per diluted common share this compares with 5793 million or 536 per diluted share for 2006 and 4801 million or 516 per share for 2005 return on average common equity was 957 and return on average assets was 101 in 2007 compared with 1289 and 132 in 2006 and 1586 and 143 in 2005 

  

the key drivers of the company’s performance during 2007 were as follows 

  

schedule 2 

  

key drivers of performance 

2007 compared to 2006 

  

   

   

as illustrated by the previous schedule the company’s earnings growth in 2007 compared to 2006 reflected the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we continue to focus on four primary objectives to drive our business success 1 organic loan and deposit growth 2 maintaining credit quality at high levels 3 managing interest rate risk and 4 controlling expenses however in 2007 results were significantly 

  

and adversely impacted by the effects of the housing market subprime mortgage and global liquidity crisis on the company this affected both the cost and availability of funding to the company and its sponsored offbalance sheet entity lockhart as well as the values of a number of securities held by the company for investment 

  

organic loan and deposit growth 

  

since 2003 the company has experienced steady and strong loan growth and moderate deposit growth augmented in 2005 and 2006 by the amegy acquisition and in 2007 by the stockmen’s acquisition through most of this period we consider this performance to be a direct result of steadily improving economic conditions throughout most of our geographical footprint and of effectively executing our operating strategies the continued strong organic loan growth in the latter half of 2007 may also have begun to reflect the increasing lack of nonbank sources of credit as global credit market conditions deteriorated sharply chart 3 depicts this growth 

  

  

as expected the company experienced little or no net organic loan growth in 2007 in its three southwestern banks cbt nba and nsb which were most heavily impacted by deteriorating conditions in the residential real estate markets in these banks declining rates of residential housing development and construction lending offset growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending the company expects that the slower rate of residential development and construction lending will continue to result in continued slower or no net loan growth in cbt nba and nsb through most if not all of 2008 

  

however loan growth remained strong throughout the year in our banks that serve geographies in which economic conditions remained more robust including zions bank amegy vectra and tcbw the result was net loan growth of 44 billion including the effect of the stockmen’s acquisition or 128 from yearend 2007 compared to yearend 2006 and a mix shift away from commercial real estate and towards commercial lending sectors in new loan originations 

  

reflecting trends throughout the banking industry core deposits grew only 19 billion from yearend 2006 a rate of 60 – significantly lagging the growth rate of loans in addition noninterestbearing demand deposits decreased by 04 billion from yearend 2006 thus the company increased its reliance on more costly sources of funding during the year 

  

maintaining credit quality at high levels 

  

the ratio of nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned deteriorated to 073 at yearend compared to 024 at the end of 2006 net loan chargeoffs for 2007 were 64 million compared to 46 million for 2006 the provision for loan losses during 2007 increased significantly to 1522 million compared to 726 million for 2006 all of these trends largely reflect the impact of deteriorating credit quality conditions in residential land acquisition and development and construction lending in the southwest and also very strong loan growth however these credit quality measures remain stronger than our peer group averages the company also has not seen clear evidence of material spillover of this deterioration into other components of its portfolio including residential mortgages credit card other consumer lending and commercial and industrial lending however in view of the unsettled market conditions and possible recession of the economy we are closely monitoring our credit measures

managing interest rate risk 

  

our focus in managing interest rate risk is not to take positions based upon management’s forecasts of interest rates but rather to maintain a position of slight “assetsensitivity” this means that our assets primarily loans tend to reprice slightly more quickly than our liabilities primarily deposits the company makes extensive use of interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk in order to seek to achieve this desired position this practice has enabled us to achieve a relatively stable net interest margin during periods of volatile interest rates which is depicted in chart 5 

  

taxableequivalent net interest income in 2007 increased 67 over 2006 the net interest margin declined to a still high 443 for 2007 down from 463 for 2006 the company was able to achieve this performance despite the challenges of a flattoinverted yield curve through most of 2007 and significant pressures on both loan pricing and funding costs that resulted in fairly steady compression of the net interest spread the difference between the average yield on all interestearning assets and the average cost of all interestbearing funding sources 

  

  

the company’s net interest margin declined more than we expected in the second half of 2007 as a result of several unusual events and trends first from august through yearend the company purchased various amounts of commercial paper issued by lockhart during the global liquidity crisis that emerged in august see “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 for a discussion of this offbalance sheet funding entity on average the company held approximately 763 million of lockhart commercial paper on its balance sheet during the fourth quarter of 2007 these assets had a very low spread over the cost of funding them and detracted approximately six basis points from the margin during the quarter the company anticipates that this lockhartrelated spread compression will continue and likely will worsen during part or all of 2008 

  

second strong loan growth through the year was funded primarily with interestbearing deposits and nondeposit funding noninterestbearing deposits as noted actually declined during the year this change in funding mix detracted approximately eight basis points from the margin in the fourth quarter and on average three basis points for the full year compared to 2006 we expect that pressure on the net interest margin may continue in 2008 

  

finally when the federal reserve board “frb” began lowering shortterm interest rates in the second half of the year deposit pricing adjusted downward much more slowly than expected based on historical patterns the company believes this is the result of strong liquidity pressures and the resulting competition for deposits that emerged globally in the second half of the year that were experienced by many depository institutions and in particular some depository institutions in the west that were heavily exposed to residential mortgages including subprime mortgages 

  

see the section “interest rate risk” on page 99 for more information regarding the company’s assetliability management “alm” philosophy and practice and our interest rate risk management 

  

controlling expenses 

  

during 2007 the company’s efficiency ratio increased to 605 from 569 for 2006 the efficiency ratio is the relationship between noninterest expense and total taxableequivalent revenue the increase in the efficiency ratio to 605 for 2007 was primarily due to the effect of the impairment and valuation losses on securities as previously discussed therefore the company believes that its “raw” efficiency ratio is not a particularly useful measure of how well operating expenses were contained in 2007 nor does it believe that this measure is particularly useful for its peers in 2007 many of which experienced large losses impairment charges and loan loss provisions as a result of market turmoil and deteriorating credit conditions the company’s efficiency ratio was 567 if the impairment and valuation losses on securities are excluded – essentially unchanged from 2006 and better reflecting our success in keeping operating expenses under control

effects of housing market subprime mortgage and global liquidity crisis on the company 

  

it is now well recognized that during the period of roughly 20042006 a speculative bubble developed in residential housing in some of the company’s key markets including arizona southern nevada and parts of california and elsewhere in the country the volume of mortgage debt outstanding grew at unprecedented rates fueled by record low interest rates and increasingly lax lending standards as reflected by socalled subprime alta and other alternative mortgages median housing prices and housing starts both 

  

increased to record levels during this period home equity lending standards also deteriorated as lenders were lulled by low default rates and rising home prices 

  

the company itself never originated subprime mortgages had almost no direct exposure to these loans and never offered residential “option arm” “negative amortization” or “piggyback” loans and purchased very few brokeroriginated mortgages or brokered home equity loans however the company has a significant business in financing residential land acquisition development and construction activity as the frb began raising interest rates in 20052007 it became increasingly apparent that the prevailing levels of housing activity were unsustainable permits to build new homes hit a record peak of over 2155000 in 2005 and then began to decline by december 2007 they had fallen to an annualized rate less than 900000 nationally this precipitous decline in housing activity has placed significant stress on a number of the company’s homebuilder customers and therefore on the company’s loan portfolio in this sector this portfolio peaked in mid 2006 as a percentage of the total loan portfolio and declined as a percentage of the total loan portfolio thereafter additionally the portfolio began to shrink in dollar value terms in the latter half of 2007 in the southwestern markets nonaccrual loans and provisions for loan losses began to increase significantly in late summer 2007 as it became clearer that this housing slump would likely be longer and deeper than originally believed the company now believes that these conditions are likely to persist throughout 2008 and into 2009 and that nonaccrual loans the provision for loan losses and net chargeoffs will likely remain elevated throughout this period 

  

as home prices in many markets stopped appreciating and then began to decline in 2007 and as interest rates remained elevated an increasing number of subprime mortgages began to default and rating agencies began to downgrade ratings on mortgagebacked securities “mbs” and debt obligations developed from pools of mbss socalled collateralized debt obligations or “cdos” values of such mbss and cdos began to decline and the holders of such instruments began to report large losses at first these were isolated but by the late summer these securities losses were both growing increasingly large and affecting a growing number of better known and well regarded financial institutions 

  

as the market lost confidence that it understood these problems and which institutions had exposure to them liquidity began to be withdrawn from all participants this affected lockhart an offbalancesheet entity sponsored by zions bank even though it had almost no exposure to subprime instruments investors became unwilling to buy socalled “assetbacked commercial paper” “abcp” regardless of the quality of the assets backing the commercial paper “cp” starting in august and continuing through yearend and into 2008 lockhart had increasing difficulty issuing sufficient cp to fund its assets the cp that it did issue was at much higher rates than had prevailed historically and had a much shorter term – often only overnight the company and its affiliates purchased lockhart cp and held it on their balance sheets these actions enlarged the company’s balance sheet decreased its net interest margin decreased its capital ratios and decreased the fee income earned from lockhart 

  

in late december it became clear that lockhart would not be able to sell sufficient cp over or shortly after yearend to fully fund its assets this then triggered the liquidity agreement between zions bank and lockhart and on december 26 and 27 zions bank 

  

purchased 840 million of securities out of lockhart at lockhart’s book value zions bank recorded these assets on its balance sheet at fair value and recognized a pretax loss of 331 million through its income statement in addition during the fourth quarter two cdo securities held by lockhart were downgraded by one rating agency to below aa which also triggered the purchase of 55 million of these securities from lockhart these were also recorded on the company’s balance sheet at fair value and a pretax loss of 165 million was recognized 

  

finally several real estate investment trusts “reit” cdos held on the balance sheet of the company declined sharply in value during the third and fourth quarters these declines in value reflected in part the growing illiquidity of the markets for any type of debt securities with real estate exposure however in december as these declines in value continued and deepened the company conducted an analysis of the risk exposures represented by these cdos as a result of this analysis the company deemed seven of these cdos to be otherthantemporarily impaired on december 18 th  and recorded a 941 million pretax impairment charge through its income statement to write the securities down to estimated fair value on december 28 th  an additional cdo was determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired and a pretax charge of 145 million was recorded 

  

altogether these purchases of securities from lockhart and the writedowns of securities held on our balance sheet reduced pretax income during the fourth quarter by 1582 million or 089 per share aftertax these writedowns were in significant part the result of the turmoil in residential real estate markets and growing illiquidity of financial markets in the second half of the year there can be no assurance that the company will not record additional losses in 2008 arising from the same causes or related causes elsewhere in this report including “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 we disclose our exposure to and valuation marks to fair value by major asset class in both lockhart’s securities and the company’s availableforsale securities portfolio 

  

capital and return on capital 

  

as regulated financial institutions the parent and its subsidiary banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios one of our goals is to maintain capital levels that are at least “well capitalized” under regulatory standards the company and each of its banking subsidiaries met the “well capitalized” guidelines at december 31 2007 in addition the parent and certain of its banking subsidiaries have issued various debt securities that have been rated by the principal rating agencies as a result another goal is to maintain capital at levels consistent with an “investment grade” rating for these debt securities the company has maintained its “investment grade” debt ratings as have those of its bank subsidiaries that have ratings at yearend 2007 the company’s tangible common equity ratio decreased to 570 compared to 598 at the end of 2006 in december 2006 the company issued 240 million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock this additional capital raised the company’s tangible equity ratio to 651 at the end of 2006 the company announced in the fourth quarter of 2006 that it would target a tangible equity ratio of 625  650 replacing the previously announced tangible common equity ratio target at december 31 2007 the company’s tangible equity ratio was 617 which was slightly below this targeted range 

  

in december 2006 the company resumed its stock repurchase plan which had been suspended since july 2005 because of the amegy acquisition on december 11 2006 the board authorized a 400 million repurchase program the company repurchased and retired 3933128 shares of its common stock during 2007 at a total cost of 3188 million and an average per share price of 8104 under this share repurchase authorization the remaining authorized amount for share repurchases as of december 31 2007 was 563 million due to growing uncertainties in global capital and funding markets the company decided that it was prudent to take steps to conserve capital and suspended its common stock repurchase program on august 16 2007 

  

  

the company continues to believe that capital in excess of that required to support the risks of the business in which it engages should be returned to the shareholders however although the company has 563 million stock buyback authorization remaining due to continued capital market disruptions and the potential for deteriorating economic conditions in 2008 it does not currently expect to resume this program until at least late 2008 

  

  

in addition we believe that the company should engage or invest in business activities that provide attractive returns on equity chart 9 illustrates that as a result of earnings improvement the exit of underperforming businesses and returning unneeded capital to the shareholders the company’s return on average common equity improved from 2003 to 2005 the decline in 2006 resulted from the additional common equity held due to additional intangible assets primarily goodwill and core deposit intangibles that resulted from the premium paid to acquire amegy the further decline in the return on average common equity in 2007 resulted primarily from the securities impairment charges and larger provision for loan losses discussed previously as well as from the additional intangible assets that resulted from the premium paid to acquire stockmen’s 

  

  

as depicted in chart 10 tangible return on average tangible common equity further improved in 2006 as the company continued to improve its core operating results however it deteriorated significantly in 2007 primarily as a result of the securities impairment and valuation losses and the increased provision for loan losses discussed previously 

  

  

note tangible return is net earnings applicable to common 

shareholders plus aftertax amortization of core deposit and 

other intangibles and impairment losses on goodwill 

  

specialty financial services and technology businesses 

  

in addition to its community and regional banking businesses the company operates a number of specialized businesses some of which are national in scope these businesses include sba 7a loan originations in which the company ranks in the top 15 nationally the company also ranks 1 in the nation in owner occupied real estate loans originated in conjunction with the sba 504 loan program and provides public finance advisory and underwriting services and software and cash management services related to the electronic imaging of checks pursuant to the check 21 act other such specialty businesses include our contango capital advisors inc “contango” feeonly wealth management advisory business and our employee stock option appreciation rights securities “esoars” marketbased employee stock options expense determination service 

  

national real estate lending 

  

this business consists of making sba 504 and similar low loantovalue primarily owneroccupied first mortgage small business commercial loans during both 2007 and 2006 the company originated directly and purchased from correspondents approximately 15 billion and 12 billion of these loans respectively from 2000 through 2005 the company securitized and credit enhanced these loans and sold them to a qualifying specialpurpose entity “qspe” lockhart which funded them through the issuance of commercial paper however during 2007 and 2006 no additional loans were securitized and sold to lockhart the company does not expect to securitize and sell to lockhart any additional loans going forward for reasons discussed elsewhere in this report see “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 for further discussion 

  

treasury management netdeposit and related services 

  

zions believes it has a significant opportunity to increase its treasury management penetration of commercial customers in its geographic territory and continued to invest in these capabilities in 2007 an increased level of investment in treasury management both in technology and service and in sales is expected to continue in 2008 

  

in addition to enhancing its general treasury management capabilities zions has made significant investments specifically in creating enhanced capabilities in services related to claims processing and reconciliation for medical providers included among these investments was the acquisition of the remaining minority interests in p5 inc “p5” during 2006 zions had for several years owned a majority interest in this startup provider of webbased claims reconciliation services at yearend 2007 p5 provided these services to over 1200 medical practitioners mostly pharmacy outlets as compared to 800 at yearend 2006 the company is in the process of integrating p5’s services and other payment processing services into its more traditional treasury management products and services for the medical provider industry p5 also has applied for and has been granted several patents covering key aspects of internetbased medical claims processing and lending against medical claims submitted through the internet it also is considering appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights 

  

we also continue to invest in our netdeposit inc “netdeposit” subsidiary that was created to develop and sell software and processes that facilitate electronic check clearing with the implementation of the check 21 act late in 2004 this company and its products are well positioned to take advantage of the revolution in check processing now underway in america during 2007 

  

netdeposit reduced earnings by 005 per diluted share compared to 007 per share in 2006 revenues for 2007 increased 325 from 2006 during 2007 netdeposit largely completed the buildout of its full suite of intended products and launched major upgrades of older products consequently late in 2007 we were able to slow the rate of additional investment in this business and reduce expenses we currently believe that netdeposit is likely to reach breakeven late in 2008 

  

the company generates revenues in several ways from this business first netdeposit licenses software sells consulting services and resells scanners to other banks and processors newly announced customers since january 1 2007 include us merchant services whitney bank farm bureau bank united commercial bank and home national bank these activities initially generate revenue from scanner sales consulting and licensing fees deploymentrelated fees related to work station site licenses and check processing follow but have been slower to increase than expected as deployment throughout the industry has been slower than expected 

  

second netdeposit has licensed its software to the company’s banks which use the capabilities of the software to provide stateofthe art cash management services to business customers and to correspondent banks at yearend over 6000 zions affiliate bank cash management customers were using netdeposit and we processed over 89 billion of imaged checks from our cash management customers in the month of december 

  

third zions bank uses netdeposit software to provide checkclearing services to correspondent banks zions bank has contracts and comarketing agreements with a number of bank processors and resellers 

  

netdeposit seeks to protect its intellectual property in business methods related to the electronic processing and clearing of checks during 2007 two patents were issued to netdeposit and several additional patent applications are pending the company believes that one or more competitors may be infringing on its patents and is now considering appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights 

  

wealth management 

  

we have extensive relationships with small and middlemarket businesses and business owners that we believe present an unusual opportunity to offer wealth management services as a result the company established a wealth management business contango and launched the business in the latter half of 2004 the business offers financial and tax planning trust and inheritance services overthecounter exchangetraded and synthetic derivative and hedging strategies quantitative asset allocation and risk management and a global array of investment strategies from equities and bonds through alternative and private equity investments at yearend contango had over 13 billion of client assets under management and a strong pipeline of referrals from our affiliate banks as compared to over 885 million under management at december 31 2006 at december 31 2007 the company had total discretionary assets under management of 29 billion including assets managed by contango amegy and western national trust company a whollyowned subsidiary of zions bank during 2007 contango generated net losses of 008 per diluted share compared with 007 per diluted share during 2006 

  

employee stock option appreciation rights 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment  which is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  we have developed a marketbased method for the valuation of employee stock options for sfas 123r purposes this method uses an online auction to price a tracking instrument that measures the fair value of the option grant on january 25 2007 we received notice from the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission “sec” that they concur with our view that our tracking instrument with modifications described in the notification is sufficiently designed to be used for sfas 123r 

  

from may 47 2007 the company successfully conducted an auction of its esoars as allowed by sfas 123r the company used the results of that auction to value its employee stock options issued on may 4 the value established was 1206 per option which the company estimates is approximately 14 below its blackscholes model valuation on that date the company recorded the related estimated future settlement obligation of esoars as a liability in the balance sheet 

  

on october 22 2007 the company announced it had received notification from the sec that its esoars are sufficiently designed as a marketbased method for valuing employee stock options under sfas 123r the sec staff did not object to the company’s view that the marketclearing price of esoars in the company’s auction was a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the underlying employee stock options 

  

the company has not as yet conducted esoars auctions on behalf of any nonzions companies but anticipates that it is likely to do so in 2008 

  

challenges to operations 

  

as we enter 2008 we see several significant challenges to improving performance 

  

global capital and funding markets remain under significant stress and most observers are increasing their forecast probabilities for a recession in the u s economy we believe this will likely have several ramifications for the company first the continued ability of lockhart to issue sufficient commercial paper to fund its assets will remain uncertain therefore it is quite possible that the company will continue to purchase lockhart’s commercial paper andor purchase assets from lockhart pursuant to the liquidity agreement downgrades of additional lockhart securities also are possible which would if sufficiently severe trigger their purchase by zions bank pursuant to the liquidity agreement all of these actions are likely to keep the company’s balance sheet larger than it otherwise would like and to depress its net interest margin the same conditions may lead to further weaknesses in securities we own that are collateralized by junior debt and trust preferred debt including reit cdos 

  

continued weakness in the residential housing construction markets particularly in arizona nevada and california is likely to result in continued higher levels of loan loss provisions and nonperforming assets than has been experienced by the company in recent years if the economy does slip into a more broadbased recession this credit quality weakness could spread to other sectors of our loan portfolio although we have seen no material indication of that yet 

  

we expect that commercial real estate loans which declined in cbt and nsb in the fourth quarter may continue to decline in our southwestern markets throughout the first half of 2008 however commercial loan growth has been strong particularly at zions bank amegy and vectra which has kept aggregate company loan growth robust in addition the company has been able to obtain somewhat better pricing as measured by spread over matched maturity cost of funds on a number of newly originated loans in recent months we expect that this pricing improvement may continue for at least the first part of 2008 

  

however due to the previously discussed general tight conditions for funding of all types as well as large needs for funding that are specific to several major competitors in our market deposit pricing has not adjusted as expected in response to recent rate reductions by the federal reserve also deposit growth particularly lower cost types of deposits has remained relatively weak these factors combined with the impact of lockhartrelated actions on our assets and liabilities means that our net interest margin came under more downward pressure than expected in the second half of 2007 we now expect that these pressures on the net interest margin may persist in the first half of 2008 

  

compliance with regulatory requirements poses an ongoing challenge in particular regulatory scrutiny of compliance programs related to antimoney laundering “aml” and the bank secrecy act “bsa” continues to increase a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with these complex regulations 

  

we have a number of business initiatives that while we believe they will ultimately produce profits for our shareholders currently generate expenses in excess of revenues three significant initiatives are contango a wealth management business started in 2004 netdeposit our subsidiary that provides electronic check processing systems and the increased investments in treasury management and medical claims capabilities as previously discussed we will need to manage these businesses carefully to ensure that expenses and revenues develop in a planned way and that profits are not impaired to an extent that is not warranted by the opportunities these businesses provide 

  

finally competition from credit unions continues to pose a significant challenge the aggressive expansion of some credit unions far beyond the traditional concept of a common bond presents a competitive threat to zions and many other banking companies while this is an issue in all of our markets it is especially acute in utah where two of the five largest financial institutions measured by local deposits are credit unions that are exempt from all state and federal income tax 

  

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

  

the notes to consolidated financial statements contain a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies we believe that an understanding of certain of these policies along with the related estimates that we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important in order to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following is a discussion of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

we have included sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

  

securitization transactions 

  

the company from time to time enters into securitization transactions that involve transfers of loans or other receivables to offbalance sheet qspes as defined in sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  in most instances we provide the servicing on these loans as a condition of the sale in addition as part of these transactions the company may retain a cash reserve account an interestonly strip or in some cases a subordinated tranche all of which are considered to be retained interests in the securitized assets 

  

whenever we initiate a securitization the first determination that we must make in connection with the transaction is whether the transfer of the assets constitutes a sale under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” if it does the assets are removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet with a gain or loss recognized otherwise the transfer is considered a financing transaction resulting in no gain or loss being recognized and the recording of a liability on the company’s consolidated balance sheet the financing treatment could have unfavorable financial implications including an adverse effect on zions’ results of operations and capital ratios however all of the company’s securitizations have been structured to meet the existing criteria for sale treatment 

  

another determination that must be made is whether the specialpurpose entity involved in the securitization is independent from the company or whether it should be included in its consolidated financial statements if the entity’s activities meet certain criteria for it to be considered a qspe no consolidation is required since all of the company’s securitizations have been with entities that have met the requirements to be treated as qspes they have met the existing accounting criteria for nonconsolidation 

  

finally we must make assumptions to determine the amount of gain or loss resulting from the securitization transaction as well as the subsequent carrying amount for the retained interests in determining the gain or loss we use assumptions that are based on the facts surrounding each securitization using alternatives to these assumptions could affect the amount of gain or loss recognized on the transaction and in turn the company’s results of operations in valuing the retained interests since quoted market prices of these interests are generally not available we must estimate their value based on the present value of the future cash flows associated with the securitizations these value estimations require the company to make a number of assumptions including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

quarterly the company reviews its valuation assumptions for retained beneficial interests under the rules contained in emerging issues task force issue no 9920 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  “eitf 9920” these rules require the company to periodically update its assumptions used to compute estimated cash flows for its retained beneficial interests and compare the net present value of these cash flows to the carrying value the company complies with eitf 9920 by quarterly evaluating and updating its assumptions including the default assumption as compared to the historical credit losses and the credit loss expectation of the portfolio and its prepayment speed assumption as compared to the historical prepayment speeds and prepayment rate expectation changes in certain 2007 assumptions from 2006 for securitizations were made in accordance with this process 

  

at december 31 2007 the company had seven small business securitizations and one home equity loan securitization the retained beneficial interests for certain of the small business securitizations required impairment charges during 2007 and 2006 following the application of eitf 9920 for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 the company incurred impairment charges of 126 million before income taxes as compared to impairment charges of 71 million during 2006 

  

schedule 3 summarizes the key economic assumptions that we used for measuring the values of the retained interests at the date of sale for securitizations during 2006 and 2005 no securitizations of small business loans were completed during 2007 or 2006 also in december 2006 the company ceased selling loans into its revolving home equity loan securitization

zions bank provides a liquidity facility for a fee to a qspe securities conduit lockhart which purchases us government and aaarated securities which are funded through the issuance of its commercial paper at december 31 2007 approximately 53 of the aaarated securities held by lockhart were created by the company’s securitization of small business loans zions bank also receives a fee in exchange for providing hedge support and administrative and investment advisory services 

  

lockhart is an offbalance sheet qspe as defined by sfas 140 should zions bancorporation and affiliates together own more than 90 of lockhart’s outstanding commercial paper lockhart would cease to be a qspe and would be required to be consolidated zions bancorporation affiliates owned 34 and 68 of the outstanding commercial paper of lockhart at december 31 2007 and february 15 2008 respectively 

  

see “offbalance sheet arrangements” beginning on page 85 for further discussion of lockhart including the liquidity agreement and security purchases from lockhart required by the liquidity agreement assets held by lockhart and information regarding the impact to the company if it were required to consolidate lockhart or purchase its remaining assets 

  

allowance for loan losses 

  

the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios along with other relevant factors these evaluations are inherently subjective and require us to make numerous assumptions estimates and judgments 

  

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type for commercial loans we use historical loss experience factors by loan segment adjusted for changes in trends and conditions to help determine an indicated allowance for each segment based on individual loan grades these factors are evaluated and updated using migration analysis techniques and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific portfolio segment the other considerations used in our analysis include volumes and trends of delinquencies levels of nonaccrual loans repossessions and bankruptcies trends in criticized and classified loans and expected losses on loans secured by real estate in addition new credit products and policies economic conditions concentrations of credit risk and the experience and abilities of lending personnel are also taken into consideration 

  

in addition to the segment evaluations nonaccrual loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of 500 thousand or more are individually evaluated in accordance with sfas no 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan to determine the level of impairment and establish a specific reserve a specific allowance may also be established for adversely graded loans below 500 thousand when it is determined that the risk associated with the loan differs significantly from the risk factor amounts established for its loan segment and risk grade 

  

the allowance for consumer loans is determined using historically developed loss experience “roll rates” at which loans migrate from one delinquency level to the next higher level using average roll rates for the most recent twelvemonth period and comparing projected losses to actual loss experience the model estimates the expected losses in dollars for the forecasted period by refreshing the model with updated data it is able to project losses for a new twelvemonth period each month segmenting the portfolio into nine product groupings with similar risk profiles 

  

as a final step to the evaluation process we perform an additional review of the adequacy of the allowance based on the loan portfolio in its entirety this enables us to mitigate the imprecision inherent in most estimates of expected credit losses this review of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any adjustments necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and concentration risks 

  

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses some are quantitative while others require us to make qualitative judgments although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address all of the components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses which would negatively impact the company’s results of operations in future periods as an example if a total of 250 million of nonclassified loans were to 

  

be immediately classified as special mention substandard and doubtful in the same proportion as the existing portfolio of the criticized and classified loans the amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2007 would increase by approximately 153 million this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in the level of the criticized and classified loans may have on the allowance estimation process we believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the potential losses in the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

  

we are in the process of developing potential changes to enhance our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses the potential changes include incorporating a twofactor grading system to include probability of default and loss given default we currently anticipate that these changes will be phased in during 2008 and 2009 

  

nonmarketable equity securities 

  

the company either directly through its banking subsidiaries or through its small business investment companies “sbic” owns investments in venture funds and other capital securities that are not publicly traded and are not accounted for using the equity method since these nonmarketable securities have no readily ascertainable fair values they are reported at amounts we have estimated to be their fair values in estimating the fair value of each investment we must apply judgment using certain assumptions initially we believe that an investment’s cost is the best indication of its fair value provided that there have been no significant positive or negative developments subsequent to its acquisition that indicate the necessity of an adjustment to a fair value estimate if and when such an event takes place we adjust the investment’s cost by an amount that we believe reflects the nature of the event in addition any minority interests in the company’s sbics reduce its share of any gains or losses incurred on these investments 

  

as of december 31 2007 the company’s total investment in nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for using the equity method was 1037 million of which its equity exposure to investments held by the sbics net of related minority interest of 287 million was 443 million in addition exposure to nonsbic equity investments not accounted for by the equity method was 307 million 

  

the values we have assigned to these securities where no market quotations exist are based upon available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that ultimately will be realized on these securities key information used in valuing these securities include the projected financial performance of these companies the evaluation of the investee company’s management team and other industry economic and market factors if there had been an active market for these securities the carrying value may have been significantly different from the amounts reported in addition since zions bank and amegy are the principal business segments holding these investments they would experience the largest impact of any changes in the fair values of these securities 

  

accounting for goodwill 

  

goodwill arises from business acquisitions and represents the value attributable to the unidentifiable intangible elements in our acquired businesses goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs this annual test as of october 1 of each year evaluations are also performed on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place such events could include among others a significant adverse change in the business climate an adverse action by a regulator an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit 

  

the first step in this evaluation process is to determine if a potential impairment exists in any of the company’s reporting units and if required from the results of this step a second step measures the amount of any impairment loss the computations required by steps 1 and 2 call for us to make a number of estimates and assumptions in completing step 1 we determine the fair value of the reporting unit that is being evaluated in determining the fair value we generally calculate value using a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies in the western and southwestern states comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash or income flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we use a similar methodology in evaluating impairment in nonbank subsidiaries but generally use companies and acquisition transactions nationally in the analysis 

  

if step 1 indicates a potential impairment of a reporting unit step 2 requires us to estimate the “implied fair value” of the reporting unit this process estimates the fair value of the unit’s individual assets and liabilities in the same manner as if a purchase of the reporting unit were taking place to do this we must determine the fair value of the assets liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit based upon the best available information if the value of goodwill calculated in step 2 is less than the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit an impairment is indicated and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to the calculated value 

  

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition changes in revenue growth trends cost structures and technology changes in discount rates changes in stock and mergers and acquisitions market values and changes in industry or market sector conditions 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2007 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation for the entire organization effective october 1 2007 step 1 was performed by using both market value and transaction value approaches for all reporting units and in certain cases the discounted cash flow approach was also used in the market value approach we identified a group of publicly traded banks that are similar in size and location to zions’ subsidiary banks and then used valuation multiples developed from the group to apply to our subsidiary banks in the transaction value approach we reviewed the purchase price paid in recent mergers and acquisitions of banks similar in size to zions’ subsidiary banks from these purchase prices we developed a set of valuation multiples which we applied to our subsidiary banks in instances where the discounted cash flow approach was used we discounted projected cash flows to their present value to arrive at our estimate of fair value 

  

upon completion of step 1 of the evaluation process we concluded that no potential impairment existed for any of the company’s reporting units in reaching this conclusion we determined that the fair values of goodwill exceeded the recorded values of goodwill since this evaluation process required us to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the company’s reporting units actual values may differ significantly from these estimates such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would in turn negatively impact the company’s results of operations and the business segments where the goodwill is recorded however had our estimated fair values been 10 lower there would still have been no indication of impairment for any of our banking reporting units 

  

accounting for derivatives 

  

our interest rate risk management strategy involves hedging the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so as to mitigate adverse effects on the company’s net interest margin and cash flows from changes in interest rates while we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading we consider it prudent to use certain derivative instruments to add stability to the company’s interest income and expense to modify the duration of specific assets and liabilities and to manage the company’s exposure to interest rate movements 

  

all derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value as of december 31 2007 the recorded amounts of derivative assets classified in other assets and derivative liabilities classified in other liabilities were 3075 million and 1040 million respectively since there are no market value quotes for the specific derivative instruments that the company holds we must estimate their fair values this estimate is made by an independent third party using a standardized methodology that nets the discounted expected future cash receipts and cash payments based on observable market inputs these future net cash flows however are susceptible to change due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates as a result the estimated values of these derivatives will typically change over time as cash is received and paid and also as market conditions change as these changes take place they may have a positive or negative impact on our estimated valuations based on the nature and limited purposes of the derivatives that the company employs fluctuations in interest rates have only had a modest effect on its results of operations as such fluctuations are generally 

  

expected to be countered by offsetting changes in income expense andor values of assets and liabilities however the company retains basis risk due to changes between the prime rate and libor on nonhedge derivative basis swaps 

  

in addition to making the valuation estimates we also face the risk that certain derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges and currently meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  may not qualify in the future as “highly effective” as defined by the statement as well as the risk that hedged transactions in cash flow hedging relationships may no longer be considered probable to occur during 2007 an immaterial amount of hedge ineffectiveness was required to be reported in earnings on the company’s cash flow hedging relationships further new interpretations and guidance related to sfas 133 continue to be issued and we cannot predict the possible impact that they will have on our use of derivative instruments in the future 

  

although the majority of the company’s hedging relationships have been designated as cash flow hedges for which hedge effectiveness is assessed and measured using a “long haul” approach the company also had five fair value hedging relationships outstanding as of december 31 2007 that were designated using the “shortcut” method as described in sfas 133 paragraph 68 the company believes that the shortcut method continues to be appropriate for those hedges because we have precisely complied with the documentation requirements and each of the applicable shortcut criteria described in paragraph 68 

  

in addition the company has a program to provide derivative financial instruments to certain customers acting as an intermediary in the transaction upon issuance all of these customer derivatives are immediately “hedged” by offsetting derivative contracts such that the company has minimized the net risk exposure resulting from such transactions 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

as discussed in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment  which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values 

  

the company used the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the value of stock options for all stock option grants prior to 2007 and off cycle stock option grants during 2007 the assumptions used to apply this model include a weighted average riskfree interest rate a weighted average expected life an expected dividend yield and an expected volatility use of these assumptions is subjective and requires judgment as described in note 17 

  

from may 47 2007 the company successfully conducted an auction of its esoars as allowed by sfas no 123r the company used the results of that auction to value its primary grant of employee stock options issued on may 4 2007 the value established was 1206 per option which the company estimates is approximately 14 below its blackscholes model valuation on that date the company recorded the related estimated future settlement obligation of esoars as a liability in the balance sheet the 2007 stock option expense for these grants was 27 million if the esoars value was 10 lower the expense would be 25 million and if the esoars value was 10 higher the expense would be 30 million 

  

on october 22 2007 the company announced it had received notification from the sec that its esoars are sufficiently designed as a marketbased method for valuing employee stock options under sfas 123r the sec staff did not object to the company’s view that the marketclearing price of esoars in the company’s auction was a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the underlying employee stock options 

  

the accounting for stock option compensation under sfas 123r decreased income before income taxes by 158 million and net income by approximately 108 million for 2007 or 010 per diluted share see note 17 for additional information on stock options and restricted stock 

  

income taxes 

  

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where it conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws related regulations and case law in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

  

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a quarterly basis if business events or circumstances warrant reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits during 2007 the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 124 million net of any federal andor state tax benefits of this reduction 86 million decreased the company’s tax provision for 2007 and 38 million reduced goodwill and taxrelated balance sheet accounts the company has tax reserves at december 31 2007 of approximately 162 million net of federal andor state benefits for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions 

  

effective january 1 2007 the company adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  as a result of adopting this new accounting guidance the company reduced its existing liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 104 million at january 1 2007 and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment as an increase to retained earnings see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes 

  

valuation of collateralized debt obligations availableforsale securities 

  

during the third quarter of 2007 the company enhanced its methodology to value certain cdos which are included in availableforsale investment securities on the balance sheet the company uses a whole market price quote method 

  

the whole market price quote method for cdos incorporates matrix pricing which uses the prices of similarly rated and type of securities to value comparable securities held by the company and includes restricted single dealer quotes the enhancement was made due to dealers’ reluctance to provide unrestricted price quotes and to provide a more representative view of comparable instruments the mechanics of the whole market price quote method included matrix market pricing when comparable securities’ pricing was available for securities on our balance sheet where comparable pricing was not available the matrix incorporated single dealer quotes 

  

the pricing methodology is consistent with the level 2 input pricing under the fair value measurement framework of sfas no 157 fair value measurements  the company will adopt sfas 157 effective january 1 2008 see notes 1 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion also see “investment securities portfolio” beginning on page 77 for further information 

  

pending adoption of accounting pronouncements 

  

effective january 1 2008 the company will adopt sfas no 157 fair value measurements and sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements adoption of sfas 157 has been delayed one year for the measurement of all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas 157 will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements sfas 159 allows for the option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value initially and at subsequent measurement with changes in fair value included in earnings the option may be applied instrument by instrument but is on an irrevocable basis the company has determined to apply the fair value option to one availableforsale trust preferred reit cdo security and three retained interests on selected small business loan securitizations in conjunction with the adoption of sfas 159 on the selected reit cdo security the company plans to implement a directional hedging program in an effort to hedge the credit exposure the company has to homebuilders in its reit cdo portfolio the cumulative effect of adopting sfas 159 is estimated to reduce the beginning balance of retained earnings at january 1 2008 by approximately 115 million comprised of a decrease of 117 million for the reit cdo and an increase of 02 million for the three retained interests

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

  

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest component of zions’ revenue for the year 2007 it was 822 of our taxableequivalent revenues compared to 764 in 2006 and 760 in 2005 the increased percentage for 2007 was mainly due to the 1582 million of impairment and valuation losses on securities which reduced total taxableequivalent noninterest revenues on a taxableequivalent basis net interest income for 2007 was up 1191 million or 67 from 2006 which was up 4066 million or 294 from 2005 the increase in taxableequivalent net interest income for 2007 was driven by strong organic loan growth that increased interestearning assets partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease in the net interest margin compared to 2006 the net interest margin for 2006 was up 5 basis points from 2005 the incremental tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all years discussed and presented 

  

by its nature net interest income is especially vulnerable to changes in the mix and amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in the interest rates and yields associated with these assets and liabilities significantly impact net interest income see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 98 for a complete discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and associated risk 

  

a gauge that we consistently use to measure the company’s success in managing its net interest income is the level and stability of the net interest margin the net interest margin was 443 in 2007 compared with 463 in 2006 and 458 in 2005 for the fourth quarter of 2007 the company’s net interest margin was 427 the margin compression for 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from the company’s strong loan growth being funded mainly by higher cost deposit products and nondeposit borrowings a decline in noninterestbearing demand deposits competitive pricing pressures and purchases of lockhart commercial paper higher yielding average loans and leases increased 44 billion from 2006 while lower yielding average money market investments and securities slightly decreased by 324 million average interestbearing deposits increased 32 billion from 2006 with most of the increase in higher cost internet money market time and foreign deposits average borrowed funds increased 850 million compared to 2006 average noninterestbearing deposits were 262 of total average deposits for 2007 compared to 290 for 2006 average time deposits greater than 100000 increased to 133 of total average deposits compared to 100 for 2006 

  

the increased net interest margin for 2006 compared to 2005 resulted mainly from an improved asset and liability mix and from the impact of increasing shortterm interest rates on zions’ balance sheet higher yielding average loans and leases increased 84 billion from 2005 while lower yielding average money market investments and securities increased 128 million the net increase in interestearnings assets was mainly funded by increases in lower cost average interestbearing deposits which increased 58 billion and average noninterestbearing deposits which increased 21 billion while average borrowed funds increased 11 billion from 2005 

  

the company expects to continue its efforts to maintain a slightly “assetsensitive” position with regard to interest rate risk however our estimates of the company’s actual position are highly dependent upon changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates modeling assumptions and the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes 

  

during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 the frb lowered the federal funds rate by 100 basis points this decrease had a rapid impact on loans tied to libor and the prime rate as these rates were lowered by 50 25 and 25 basis points on september 18 th  october 31 st  and december 11 th  respectively due to the intense competition for bank deposits the rates paid to consumers for their deposits were lowered less than 100 basis points competitive pressures on deposit rates impeded our ability to reprice deposits which had a negative impact on the net interest margin during the fourth quarter of 2007 we expect that these competitive pricing pressures may continue into 2008 see “interest rate risk” on page 99 for further information

schedule 6 analyzes the yeartoyear changes in net interest income on a fully taxableequivalent basis for the years indicated for purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans however interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions in addition interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates 

  

schedule 6 

  

analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate 

  

   

    

in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate changes due to the volumerate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate both increase the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate when the rate increases and volume decreases the variance is allocated to the rate 

  

provisions for credit losses 

  

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that based on our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based upon the inherent risks in the portfolio the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level in determining adequate levels of the allowance and reserve we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs and statistical trends and other economic factors see “credit risk management” on page 88 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

  

for the year 2007 the provision for loan losses was 1522 million compared to 726 million for 2006 and 430 million for 2005 the increased provision for 2007 resulted mainly from significant softening in our credit quality particularly in relation to residential land development and construction activity in the southwest with arizona california and nevada being most severely impacted net loan and lease chargeoffs increased to 636 million in 2007 up from 458 million in 2006 and 250 million in 2005 the 178 million increase during 2007 was primarily driven by higher chargeoffs in amegy and higher chargeoffs in nba cbt and nsb primarily related to residential land development and construction loans the provision for 2006 reflected increased provisioning driven by loan growth and a 109 million loss at nba on an equipment lease related to an alleged accounting fraud at a water bottling company 

  

including the provision for unfunded lending commitments the total provision for credit losses was 1540 million for 2007 738 million for 2006 and 464 million for 2005 from period to period the amounts of unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizeable fluctuation due to changes in the timing and volume of loan originations and associated funding 

  

noninterest income 

  

noninterest income represents revenues the company earns for products and services that have no interest rate or yield associated with them noninterest income for 2007 comprised 178 of taxableequivalent revenues reflecting the 1582 million of impairment and valuation losses on securities which reduced noninterest income for 2007 compared to 236 for 2006 and 240 for 2005 schedule 7 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years 

  

schedule 7 

  

noninterest income 

  

   

nm – not meaningful 

  

noninterest income for 2007 decreased 1389 million or 252 compared to 2006 the largest component of this decrease was the 1582 million of impairment and valuation losses on securities excluding the impairment and valuation losses on securities noninterest income increased 193 million or 35 compared to 2006 noninterest income for 2006 increased 1143 million or 262 compared to 2005 reflecting the impact of the amegy acquisition in december 2005 excluding the impact of the amegy acquisition the largest components of this increase were in net equity securities gains which were 178 million in 2006 compared with net losses of 13 million in 2005 and net gains from fixed income securities which increased 40 million 

  

service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased 228 million in 2007 the increase was mainly due to the impact of fee increases across the company continuing efforts to promote treasury management services to our customers and the acquisition of stockmen’s the significant increase for 2006 was mainly a result of the acquisition of amegy 

  

loan sales and servicing income includes revenues from securitizations of loans as well as from revenues that we earn through servicing loans that have been sold to third parties for 2007 loan sales and servicing income decreased 290 compared to 2006 and decreased 303 between 2006 and 2005 the decreases were due to no home equity loan securitization sale transactions in 2007 no small business loan securitization sale transactions in 2007 and 2006 lower servicing fees from lower loan balances and retained interest impairment writedowns of 126 million in 2007 and 71 million in 2006 these writedowns resulted primarily from higher than expected loan prepayments increased default assumptions and changes in the interest rate environment as determined from our periodic evaluation of beneficial interests as required by eitf 9920 as of december 31 2007 the company had 498 million of retained interests in small business securitizations recorded on the balance sheet that are exposed to additional future impairments due to the above mentioned factors see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company’s securitization programs 

  

other service charges commissions and fees which is comprised of public finance fees automated teller machine “atm” fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit card interchange fees cash management fees and other miscellaneous fees increased 250 million or 146 from 2006 which was up 472 from 2005 the increase in 2007 was primarily driven by higher public finance fees debit card fees and cash management related fees the cash management fees include webbased medical claims transaction fees remote check imaging fees and thirdparty ach transaction fees the increase was offset by decreased insurance income of 50 million resulting from the sale of the company’s grant hatch insurance agency and certain other insurance assets completed during the first quarter of 2007 the 2006 increase was primarily due to the amegy acquisition 

  

trust and wealth management income for 2007 increased 217 compared to 2006 which was up 351 compared to 2005 the increase for 2007 was from organic growth in the trust and wealth management business including growth related to our contango wealth management and associated trust business as well as growth in the amegy trust and wealth management business the increase for 2006 is from the amegy acquisition and increased fees from organic growth in the trust and wealth management business 

  

income from securities conduit decreased 140 million or 435 for 2007 compared to 2006 this income represents fees we receive from lockhart a qspe securities conduit the decrease in income is due to the higher cost of assetbacked commercial paper used to fund lockhart resulting from the recent disruptions in the credit markets and a decrease in the size of lockhart’s securities portfolio the book value of lockhart’s securities portfolio declined to 21 billion at december 31 2007 from 41 billion at december 31 2006 due to repayments of principal and zions’ purchase of securities out of lockhart we expect that the book value of the lockhart portfolio will continue to decrease income from securities conduit will depend both on the amount of securities held in the portfolio and on the cost of the commercial paper used to fund those securities the 80 decrease in income for 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from lower fees on the investment holdings in lockhart’s securities portfolio see “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 “liquidity management actions” on page 106 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding securitizations and lockhart 

  

dividends and other investment income consist of revenue from the company’s bankowned life insurance program dividends on securities holdings and revenues from other investments revenues from investments include dividends on federal home loan bank “fhlb” stock federal reserve bank stock and equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and were 230 million in 2007 133 million in 2006 and 111 million in 2005 the increased income in 2007 is primarily from investments accounted for using the equity method income from equity method investments was 97 million in 2007 compared to 23 million in 2006 the increase for 2006 is mainly due to the amegy acquisition revenue from bankowned life insurance programs was 279 million in 2007 266 million in 2006 and 189 million in 2005 

  

trading and nonhedge derivative income consists of the following 

  

schedule 8 

  

trading and nonhedge derivative income 

  

   

trading and nonhedge derivative income decreased 154 million or 832 compared to 2006 the decline is primarily due to decreases in the fair value of nonhedge derivatives resulting from decreasing spreads during the second half of the year between the london interbank offer rate “libor” and the prime rate trading income for 2006 increased 16 million or 98 compared to 2005 excluding amegy trading income decreased 52 million during 2006 mainly due to a decision made to close our london trading office in the fourth quarter of 2005 and reduce the amount of the company’s trading assets in response to margin pressures nonhedge derivative income was 06 million for 2006 compared to a loss of 06 million in 2005 which included losses of 09 million from two ineffective cash flow hedges 

  

net equity securities gains in 2007 were 177 million as compared to net gains of 178 million in 2006 and net losses of 13 million in 2005 net gains for 2007 included a 25 million gain on the sale of an investment in a community bank and net gains on venture capital equity investments of 154 million net of related minority interest of 80 million income taxes and other expenses venture capital investments contributed 34 million to net income in 2007 compared to net income of 41 million for 2006 and losses of 22 million for 2005 

  

impairment losses of 1086 million on eight reit trust preferred cdo availableforsale securities combined with valuation losses of 496 million on securities purchased from lockhart aggregated to a 1582 million impairment and valuation loss during 2007 the losses on the eight reit trust preferred cdo securities were a result of our ongoing review for otherthantemporary impairment the valuation losses on securities purchased from lockhart was due to marking to fair value 55 million of securities purchased after rating agency downgrades and 840 million of securities purchased due to the absence of sufficient commercial paper funding for lockhart see “investment securities portfolio” on page 77 and “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 for further discussion 

  

other noninterest income for 2007 was 222 million compared to 196 million for 2006 and 156 million for 2005 the increase in 2007 included a 29 million gain of the sale of the company’s insurance business during 2007 the increase in 2006 was primarily due to the acquisition of amegy and netdeposit revenue from scanner sales 

  

noninterest expense 

  

noninterest expense for 2007 increased 56 over 2006 which was 314 higher than in 2005 the 2006 increase was impacted by the acquisition of amegy 205 million of merger related expenses and debt extinguishment costs of 73 million schedule 9 summarizes the major components of noninterest expense and provides a comparison of the components over the past three years

the company’s efficiency ratio was 605 for 2007 compared to 569 for 2006 and 557 for 2005 the increase in the efficiency ratio to 605 for 2007 was primarily due to the previously discussed impairment and valuation losses on securities the efficiency ratio was 567 excluding the impairment and valuation losses 

  

salary costs for 2007 increased 64 over 2006 which were up 310 from 2005 the increases for 2007 resulted mainly from merit pay salary increases and increased staffing related to other business expansion the salary costs for 2007 also included sharebased compensation expense of approximately 283 million up from 244 million for 2006 the increases for 2006 resulted primarily from the acquisition of amegy increased incentive plan costs additional staffing related to the buildout of our wealth management business netdeposit and to other business expansion and sharebased compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas 123r in 2006 employee health and insurance benefits for 2007 increased 242 from 2006 which increased 97 from 2005 the increase for 2006 resulted primarily from the acquisition of amegy employee health and insurance expense for 2006 included an adjustment which reduced expense by approximately 40 million to reflect accumulated cash balances available to pay incurred but not reported medical claims salaries and employee benefits are shown in greater detail in schedule 10

occupancy expense increased 78 million or 78 compared to 2006 which was up 287 from 2005 the 2007 increase is impacted by higher facilities rent expense higher facilities maintenance and utilities expense and the impact of the acquisition of stockmen’s the increase for 2006 was mainly due to the amegy acquisition 

  

furniture and equipment expense for 2007 increased 78 million or 88 compared to 2006 which was up 301 from 2005 the increase in 2007 was mainly due to increased maintenance contract costs related to technology and operational assets the increase for 2006 resulted primarily from the acquisition of amegy 

  

merger related expense decreased 152 million or 741 compared to 2006 the decrease is mainly due to the completion of the amegy system conversion during 2006 merger related expenses for 2006 and 2005 are mainly incremental costs associated with the integration and system conversions of amegy see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on merger related expenses

impairment losses on goodwill 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2007 2006 and 2005 the company completed the annual goodwill impairment analysis as required by sfas 142 and concluded there was no impairment on the goodwill balances 

  

foreign operations 

  

zions bank and amegy both operate foreign branches in grand cayman grand cayman islands bwi the branches only accept deposits from qualified customers while deposits in these branches are not subject to federal reserve board reserve requirements or federal deposit insurance corporation insurance requirements there are no federal or state income tax benefits to the company or any customers as a result of these operations 

  

foreign deposits at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 totaled 34 billion 26 billion and 22 billion respectively and averaged 27 billion for 2007 21 billion for 2006 and 07 billion for 2005 all of these foreign deposits were related to domestic customers of the banks see schedule 29 on page 81 for foreign loans outstanding 

  

in addition to the grand cayman branch zions bank through a whollyowned subsidiary had an office in the united kingdom that provided sales support for its us dollar trading operations the office was closed during the fourth quarter of 2005 

  

income taxes 

  

the company’s income tax expense for 2007 was 2357 million compared to 3180 million for 2006 and 2634 million for 2005 the company’s effective income tax rates including the effects of minority interest were 323 in 2007 353 in 2006 and 354 in 2005 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 122 million net of any federal andor state tax benefits of this reduction 91 million decreased the company’s tax provision for 2007 and 31 million reduced goodwill the primary cause of the decrease was the closing of various state statutes of limitations and tax examinations as a result of the recognition of certain tax benefits accrued interest payable on unrecognized tax benefits was also reduced by approximately 28 million net of any federal andor state benefits since the company classifies interest and penalties related to tax matters as a component of tax expense the reduction in interest on unrecognized tax benefits also resulted in a decrease to the company’s tax provision for 2007 the average effective tax rate in 2007 also was lower than in prior years because the securities impairment charges recorded in 2007 affected taxable revenue thereby increasing the proportion of nontaxable income relative to total income 

  

in 2004 the company signed an agreement that confirmed and implemented its award of a 100 million allocation of tax credit authority under the community development financial institutions fund set up by the us government under the program zions has invested 100 million as of december 31 2007 in a whollyowned subsidiary which makes qualifying loans and investments in return zions receives federal income tax credits that will be recognized over seven years including the year in which the funds were invested in the subsidiary zions invested 20 million in its subsidiary in 2005 an additional 10 million in 2006 and another 10 million during 2007 income tax expense was reduced by 56 million for 2007 45 million for 2006 and 40 million for 2005 as result of these tax credits we expect that we will be able to reduce the company’s federal income tax payments by a total of 39 million over the life of this award which is expected to be for the years 2004 through 2013

net income for zions bank decreased 198 to 1538 million for 2007 compared to 1918 million for 2006 and 1741 million for 2005 the decrease in earnings was primarily due to impairment losses on investment securities and increased provision for loan losses results include the wealth management group which includes contango and which had aftertax net losses of 88 million in 2007 79 million in 2006 and 62 million in 2005 on january 1 2008 contango became a direct subsidiary of the parent 

  

earnings at zions bank for 2007 were driven by a 167 or 791 million increase in net interest income this increase resulted from strong loan growth of 23 billion strong deposit growth and stable net interest margin balance sheet growth reflected strong economic conditions in zions bank’s primary markets the bank’s successful sales efforts and our decision not to securitize and sell any small business loans during the year the net interest margin was 390 for 2007 compared to 389 for 2006 and 368 for 2005

net interest income for 2007 decreased 74 or 346 million to 4348 million compared to 4694 million for 2006 and 4514 million for 2005 the decrease was the result of a 63 or 620 million decrease in average earning assets primarily due to lower loan balances in the residential land acquisition and development and construction portfolios and to a lesser extent a lower net interest margin net interest income for 2006 increased 40 or 180 million compared to 2005 this increase was attributable to a 62 or 572 million growth in average earning assets offset slightly by a lower net interest margin

the provision for loan losses to 335 million in 2007 compared to 150 million in 2006 as well as the increased net loan chargeoffs cbt continues to emphasize growing the commercial and small business loan portfolios and managing the runoff of real estate loans cbt does not expect total loans to grow significantly in 2008 compared to 2007 given the tenuous business climate and uncertain economy

schedule 15 

  

amegy corporation 

  

   

   

record levels of revenue resulted from amegy’s strong sales culture a healthy texas economy and the dedicated efforts of a stable and talented corps of relationship officers and administrative personnel 

  

net interest income was driven by record levels of period end loan growth of 16 billion or 244 the net interest margin declined from 436 in 2006 to 413 in 2007 as a result of increased competitive pressure for deposits and a heavier reliance on wholesale type funding to support growth in the loan portfolio loan growth was primarily focused in the commercial and industrial sectors with continued growth in the real estate lending groups

national bank of arizona 

  

nba the company’s financial institution responsible for operations in arizona is the fourth largest fullservice commercial bank in arizona measured by deposits booked in the state following the acquisition by nba in january 2007 of stockmen’s the branch network in arizona expanded by 43 to the present level of 76 branches reaching every county within the state arizona’s economic performance and outlook has taken a downturn over the year yet population growth continues to be one the strongest in the entire country population in the state exceeds 65 million residents and increased over 3 in 2007 compared to 2006 the phoenix and tucson metropolitan areas also experienced an increase of over 3 over 2006 and together comprise over 80 of the state’s population with over 52 million individuals net migration into the state is expected to continue over the next several years but at a slightly more moderate pace 

  

the housing industry was deeply impacted during the year by the contraction in the real estate market which has been a key economic driver for the state’s economy permits for new residential construction plummeted from one of the highest point experienced in 2005 of over 85000 to approximately 66062 in 2006 and approximately 50000 in 2007 by novemberdecember 2007 the annualized run rate of new permits issued had declined to approximately 16000 this downward trend is expected to continue into the near future at a lower pace the effects of the housing industry slowdown have begun to impact the commercial real estate segment of the market but not nearly as severely vacancy rates have exhibited a slight increase over the year and the velocity of rental rate increases on a per square foot basis have tapered in the year within the metropolitan marketplaces 

  

despite the impacts from the construction industry trimming over 23000 jobs in the state within one year the state’s job market still reflected positive gains for the full year 2007 however job growth did turn negative late in the year the trend of employment declines is expected to continue into the next year with a projected increase in unemployment as the fallout from the struggling home building industry begins to impact other market sectors 

  

schedule 17 

  

national bank of arizona 

  

   

nba’s net income of 678 million in 2007 reflected a decrease of 74 which followed a 144 growth in earnings in 2006 net interest income increased by 167 to 2508 million as earning assets and net interest income increased with the acquisition of stockmen’s at the beginning of the year the net interest margin declined from 520 in 2006 to 508 in 2007 the margin compression primarily reflects a decline in noninterestbearing deposits a continued reliance on noncore deposit funding coupled with the consequences of deposit pricing in an increasingly competitive marketplace seeking to attract and retain deposits 

  

noninterest income increased 315 in 2007 compared to 2006 following an 181 improvement in 2006 during 2007 nba increased the number of depository accounts largely a result of the stockmen’s acquisition the increase in the number of customer accounts coupled with fee increases drove a 736 increase in deposit service charges loan sales and servicing income declined 194 reflecting the diminished residential housing activity in arizona 

  

noninterest expense rose by 394 million in 2007 or 383 compared with an increase of 52 million or 53 in 2006 the 2007 change is almost solely due to the operating costs amortization and merger costs related to the stockmen’s acquisition early in 2007 through the acquisition nba was able to expand its branch network and operating personnel providing a positive impact on the enterprise’s revenue stream 

  

schedule 18 

  

national bank of arizona 

  

   

net loans grew by 519 million for the year an increase of 128 following a 100 growth rate in 2006 the net loans acquired in the stockmen’s acquisition were 561 million which exceeded nba’s net loan growth for 2007 in light of the slowing and changing economy growth has also slowed and reflects the selective ability to pursue customers and relationships which fit the long term profile of the bank net deposit growth totaling 176 million also was attributable to the purchase of stockmen’s bank the continued competitive pressures and the expanding reach of new financial institutions into the market during the year placed pressure on attracting new and retaining existing deposits 

  

the return on average assets and average common equity for nba declined for the year principally due to the higher provision for loan losses and credit costs and net interest margin compression as margin compression lowered the net interest income the impact of higher credit and merger related expenses outpaced revenue improvements and thus increased the efficiency ratio in 2007 when compared to prior years 

  

nonperforming assets increased to 761 million at december 31 2006 compared to 122 million at yearend 2006 reflecting the affects of a softening economy particularly on residential land acquisition development and construction loan quality net chargeoffs were 136 million for 2007 up from 113 million for 2006 the provision for loan losses increased to 305 million compared to 163 million in the prior year the change in all of these credit quality related amounts reflect the deterioration in the housing and general real estate market in arizona

noninterest income for 2007 increased 54 to 329 million compared to 312 million for 2006 and 310 million for 2005 

  

noninterest expense increased by 09 compared to 2006 which was up 43 from 2005 franchise expansion was the major drivers to the growth in noninterest expense in both 2007 and 2006 and salaries and increased affiliate service allocations were the largest components of those increases nsb’s efficiency ratio was 518 for 2007 484 for 2006 and 524 for 2005 the bank continues to focus on managing operating costs to improve its efficiency

interestearning assets consist of money market investments securities and loans and leases schedule 5 which we referred to in our discussion of net interest income includes the average balances of the company’s interestearning assets the amount of revenue generated by them and their respective yields as shown in the schedule average interestearning assets in 2007 increased 113 to 430 billion from 387 billion in 2006 mainly driven by strong organic loan growth average interestearning assets comprised 881 of total average assets in 2007 compared with 874 in 2006 average interestearning assets in 2007 were 923 of average tangible assets compared with 917 in 2006 

  

average money market investments consisting of interestbearing deposits and commercial paper federal funds sold and security resell agreements increased 741 in 2007 to 834 million from 479 million in 2006 the increase in average money market investments is due in part to the assetbacked commercial paper that the affiliate banks purchased from lockhart during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 see discussion in “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 for further details average investment securities decreased 67 for 2007 compared to 2006 average net loans and leases for 2007 increased 136 compared to 2006 

  

investment securities portfolio 

  

we invest in securities both to generate revenues for the company and to manage liquidity schedule 26 presents a profile of the company’s investment portfolios at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the amortized cost amounts represent the company’s original cost for the investments adjusted for accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments related to the security the estimated fair values are the amounts that we believe most accurately reflect assumptions that other participants in the market place would use in pricing the securities as of the dates indicated 

  

schedule 26 

  

investment securities portfolio 

  

   

the amortized cost of investment securities at yearend 2007 increased 284 million from 2006 the increase was largely due to zions bank purchasing 840 million at book value of us government agencyguaranteed and aaarated securities from lockhart in december 2007 these actions were taken pursuant to the liquidity agreement between zions bank and lockhart which requires securities purchases in the absence of sufficient commercial paper funding since the fair value of the assets purchased was less than their book value a pretax writedown of 331 million was recorded in conjunction with the purchase of these securities additionally during november and december the company purchased two securities totaling 55 million from lockhart that were downgraded below aa by fitch ratings the pretax charge for these securities purchased from lockhart to mark them to estimated fair value was approximately 165 million 

  

at december 31 2007 65 of the 51 billion of availableforsale securities consisted of aaarated structured municipal securities government or agency guaranteed securities and 26 consisted of arated securities in addition approximately 3 of the availableforsale portfolio was rated bbb and the 6 of the portfolio was unrated and below investment grade securities 

  

included in assetbacked securities at december 31 2007 are cdos collateralized by trust preferred securities issued by banks insurance companies or reits which may have some exposure to the subprime market in addition assetbacked securities – other includes 112 million of certain structured assetbacked collateralized debt obligations “abs cdos” also known as diversified structured finance cdos purchased from lockhart which have minimal exposure to nonzions originated subprime and home equity 

  

mortgage securitizations the 112 million of abs cdos includes approximately 28 million of subprime mortgage securities and 16 million of home equity credit line securities see further discussion of certain cdos held by lockhart in “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 

  

at december 31 2007 the company valued certain cdo securities using a matrix pricing methodology see further discussion in “critical accounting policies and significant estimates” on page 34 

  

we review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of otherthantemporary impairment “otti” taking into consideration current market conditions fair value in relationship to cost extent and nature of change in fair value issuer rating changes and trends volatility of earnings current analysts’ evaluations our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value which may be maturity and other factors our review resulted in a pretax charge of 1086 million for otti during the fourth quarter of 2007 for eight reit cdo securities the collateral in these securities includes debt issued by commercial income reits commercial mortgagebacked securities residential mortgage reits and home builders the decision to deem these securities otti was based on the near term financial prospects for collateral in each cdo a specific analysis of the structure of each security and an evaluation of the underlying collateral using information and industry knowledge available to zions 

  

future reviews for otti will consider the particular facts and circumstances during the reporting period in review 

  

schedule 27 also presents information regarding the investment securities portfolio this schedule presents the maturities of the different types of investments that the company owned as of december 31 2007 and the corresponding average interest rates that the investments will yield if they are heldtomaturity it should be noted that most of the sba loanbacked securities and assetbacked securities are variable rate and their repricing periods are significantly less than their contractual maturities also see “liquidity risk” on page 104 and notes 1 4 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s investment securities and their management

the investment securities portfolio at december 31 2007 includes 908 million of nonrated fixedincome securities compared to 881 million at december 31 2006 as shown in schedule 28 nonrated municipal securities held in the portfolio were underwritten as to credit by zions bank’s municipal credit department in accordance with its established municipal credit standards virtually all the securities were originated by the company’s financial services business 

  

schedule 28 

  

nonrated securities 

  

   

in addition to the nonrated municipal securities the portfolio includes nonrated assetbacked subordinated tranches the assetbacked subordinated tranches created from the company’s loans are mainly the subordinated retained interests of small business loan securitizations the senior tranches of these securitizations are sold to lockhart a qspe securities conduit described further in “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 at december 31 2007 these comprised 183 million of the 203 million set forth in schedule 30 the tranches not created from the company’s loans are tranches of bank and insurance company trust preferred cdos 

  

although the credit quality of these nonrated securities generally is high it would be difficult to market them in a short period of time since they are not rated and there is no active trading market for them 

  

loan portfolio 

  

as of december 31 2007 net loans and leases accounted for 738 of total assets unchanged from yearend 2006 and 770 of tangible assets as compared to 772 at december 31 2006 schedule 29 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2007 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in certain cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 99 

  

schedule 29 

  

loan portfolio by type and maturity 

  

   

loan growth was strong during 2007 at zions bank amegy vectra tcbw and tcbo however loan growth at nba and nsb slowed considerably during 2007 and cbt experienced a reduction in outstanding loans loan growth included the impact of the loans acquired from the stockmen’s acquisition as previously discussed in “business segment results” beginning on page 57 we expect that loan growth will continue in 2008 in most of our subsidiary banks but continue to be stagnant at nba nsb and cbt until conditions in the residential real estate sector improve however the average growth experienced in 2007 may not be sustainable throughout 2008 

  

sold loans being serviced 

  

the company performs loan servicing operations on both loans that it holds in its portfolios as well as loans that are owned by third party investorowned trusts servicing loans includes 

  

   

   

   

   

the company receives a fee for performing loan servicing for third parties failure by the company to service the loans in accordance with the contractual requirements of the servicing agreements may lead to the termination of the servicing contract and the loss of future servicing fees 

  

schedule 30 

  

sold loans being serviced 

  

   

the company has securitized and sold a portion of the loans that it originated and purchased in many instances we agreed to provide the servicing on these loans as a condition of the sale schedule 30 summarizes the sold loans other than conforming longterm first mortgage real estate loans that the company was servicing as of the dates indicated and the related loan sales activity as reflected in the schedule sales for 2007 decreased approximately 154 million compared to 2006 which were down 982 million from 2005 the company did not complete a small business loans securitization during 2007 or 2006 and also discontinued selling new home equity credit lines originations during the fourth quarter of 2006 small business consumer and other sold loans being serviced totaled 19 billion at the end of 2007 compared to 26 billion at the end of 2006 see notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on asset securitizations in addition at december 31 2007 conforming longterm first mortgage real estate loans being serviced for others was 1232 million compared with 1251 million at yearend 2006 

  

although it performs the servicing the company exerts no control nor does it have any equity interest in any of the trusts that own the securitized loans however as of december 31 2007 the company had recorded assets in the amount of 267 million in connection with sold loans being serviced of 19 billion as is a common practice with securitized transactions the company had subordinated retained interests in the securitized assets amounting to 210 million at december 31 2007 representing junior positions to the other investors in the trust securities the capitalized residual cash flows which is sometimes referred to as “excess servicing” of 57 million primarily represent the present value of the excess cash flows that have been projected over the lives of the sold loans these excess cash flows are subject to prepayment risk which is the risk that a loan will be paid prior to its contractual maturity when this occurs any remaining excess cash flows associated with the loan would be reduced see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on asset securitizations and “offbalance sheet arrangements” on page 85 

  

other earning assets 

  

as of december 31 2007 the company had 1034 million of other noninterestbearing investments compared with 1022 million in 2006 the increase in other noninterestbearing investments resulted mainly from increases in federal home loan bank stock and increases in the nonsbic investment funds 

  

schedule 31 

  

other noninterestbearing investments 

  

   

   

bankowned life insurance investments declined 26 million during 2007 mainly due to the company surrendering three bankowned life insurance contracts during the first quarter the increase in cash surrender value of the remaining policies is not taxable since it is anticipated that the bankowned life insurance will be held until the eventual death of the insured employees 

  

fhlb and federal reserve stock investments increased 38 million from december 31 2006 primarily during the third quarter of 2007 the increase is mainly due to increased investments the company made at the fhlbs to increase the company’s borrowing capacity 

  

sbic investments decreased 31 million from december 31 2006 due to the sale and profitable exit of investments in our venture funds 

  

nonsbic investment funds increased 28 million during 2007 primarily as a result of increased investment in funds within existing investment commitments and appreciation on existing investments 

  

the investments in publicly traded companies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are set forth in schedule 32 

  

schedule 32 

  

investments in other public companies 

  

   

deposits and borrowed funds 

  

deposits both interestbearing and noninterestbearing are a primary source of funding for the company intense competition for deposits during the year resulted in deposit growth lagging the company’s strong loan growth and also impeded our ability to reprice our deposits as the federal reserve lowered rates during the second half of the year management expects that deposit growth may continue to lag behind loan growth and that a portion of future loan growth may be funded from alternative higher cost funding sources 

  

schedule 5 summarizes the average deposit balances for the past five years along with their respective interest costs and average interest rates average noninterestbearing deposits decreased 11 in 2007 over 2006 while interestbearing deposits increased 136 during the same time period 

  

total deposits at december 31 2007 increased 19 billion to 369 billion or 55 over the balances reported at december 31 2006 core deposits increased 19 million to 325 billion or 60 compared to 307 billion at december 31 2006 the company experienced strong growth in its internet money market deposits during 2007 with balances increasing 10 billion to 22 billion or 825 compared to 12 billion at december 31 2006 noninterestbearing demand deposits at december 31 2007 decreased 04 billion to 96 billion compared to 100 billion at december 31 2006 the mix of deposits reflects the decline in demand deposits during the year as demand savings and money market deposits comprised 720 of total deposits at december 31 2007 compared with 740 as of december 31 2006 

  

see “liquidity risk” on page 104 for information on funding and borrowed funds also see notes 11 12 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on borrowed funds 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company administers one qspe securities conduit lockhart which was established in 2000 lockhart was structured to purchase securities that are collateralized by small business loans originated or purchased by zions bank such loans were originated between 2000 and 2005 lockhart obtains funding through the issuance of assetbacked commercial paper and holds securities which include securities that are collateralized by small business loans us government agency and aaarated securities 

  

liquidity agreement 

  

zions bank is the sole provider of a liquidity facility to lockhart lockhart purchases us government agency and aaarated securities which are funded through the issuance of lockhart’s assetbacked commercial paper pursuant to the liquidity agreement zions bank is required to purchase nondefaulted securities from lockhart to provide funds to repay maturing commercial paper upon lockhart’s inability to access the commercial paper market for sufficient funding or upon a commercial paper market disruption as specified in the governing documents of lockhart in addition pursuant to the governing documents including the liquidity agreement if any security in lockhart is downgraded to below aa or the downgrade of one or more securities results in more than ten securities having ratings of aa to aa zions bank must either 1 place its letter of credit on the security 2 obtain a credit enhancement on the security from a third party or 3 purchase the security from lockhart at book value 

  

the maximum amount of liquidity that zions bank can be required to provide pursuant to the liquidity agreement is limited to the total amount of securities held by lockhart this maximum amount was 21 billion at yearend 2007 41 billion at december 31 2006 and 53 billion at december 31 2005 as of february 15 2008 the total amount of securities held by lockhart was 19 billion and the company owned 13 billion of lockhart commercial paper 

  

in addition to providing the liquidity agreement zions bank receives a fee in exchange for providing hedge support and administrative and investment advisory services to lockhart 

  

a hedge agreement between lockhart and zions bank provides for the bank to pay lockhart should lockhart’s monthly cost of funds exceed its monthly asset yield this agreement has never been triggered the spread between lockhart’s monthly asset yield and cost 

  

of funds has narrowed as a result of increased commercial paper rates resulting from the ongoing contraction and disruption in the credit markets although not expected it is possible that this hedge agreement could be triggered 

  

in addition to rating agency downgrades of securities held by lockhart that would require the company to purchase securities from lockhart the following rating agency actions may result in security purchases under the liquidity agreement 

  

   

   

at december 31 2007 lockhart owned six securities aggregating 11 billion that are insured by mbia and backed by small business loans securitized by zions and one security of 111 million insured by ambac the mbiainsured securities did not have underlying public ratings the ambacinsured security had an underlying public rating of aaa from fitch and no underlying rating from moody’s investors service 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2007 certain assets held by lockhart were downgraded by rating agencies and lockhart was unable to sell certain amounts of commercial paper at times these events were caused by market deterioration in the assetbacked commercial paper markets due to the subprime mortgage and global liquidity crisis described previously 

  

on november 21 2007 fitch ratings downgraded from “aaa” to “b” a 30 million abs cdo held by lockhart under the terms of the liquidity agreement zions bank purchased this security at book value a pretax writedown of 97 million was recorded by zions bank in marking the security to fair value on december 21 2007 fitch ratings downgraded from “aaa” to “a” a 25 million reit cdo held by lockhart under the terms of the liquidity agreement zions bank purchased this security at book value a pretax writedown of 68 million was recorded by zions bank in marking this security to fair value 

  

on december 26 and 27 2007 zions bank purchased us government agencyguaranteed and aaarated securities from lockhart at a price of 840 million equal to book value plus accrued and unpaid interest which reduced the amount of outstanding commercial paper issued by lockhart by a like amount these actions were taken pursuant to the liquidity agreement between zions bank and lockhart when lockhart could not issue a sufficient amount of commercial paper since the fair value of the assets purchased was less than their book value a pretax writedown of 331 million was recorded by zions bank in conjunction with the purchase of these securities 

  

if lockhart is unable to issue additional commercial paper to finance maturing commercial paper or if additional assets of lockhart are downgraded below the ratings described above zions bank will be obligated to purchase additional assets from lockhart zions bank may incur losses in connection with any such purchases because the price would be based on book value but zions bank would 

  

record the asset at fair value which may be lower at december 31 2007 the book value of lockhart’s 21 billion of assets exceeded their fair value by approximately 22 million which increased to approximately 40 million as of january 31 2008 

  

subsequent event 

  

on february 6 2008 a 5 million security held by lockhart was downgraded by moody’s from aa1 to baa1 zions bank purchased this security at book value under the liquidity agreement the related pretax writedown of 08 million was recorded by zions bank in marking the security to fair value in addition lockhart was unable to sell sufficient commercial paper to fund commercial paper maturities and zions bank purchased 121 million of mbiainsured securities from lockhart as required under the liquidity agreement these securities consisted of securitizations of small business loans from zions bank and their purchase resulted in no gain or loss upon dissolution of the securitization trusts the loans were recorded on zions bank’s balance sheet

at december 31 2007 the weighted average interest rate reset of lockhart’s assets was 19 months and the weighted average life of lockhart’s assets was estimated at 34 years the weighted average life of lockhart’s assetbacked commercial paper was six days 

  

possible consolidation of lockhart 

  

lockhart is an offbalance sheet qspe as defined by sfas 140 should zions bancorporation and its affiliates together own more than 90 of the outstanding commercial paper beneficial interest of lockhart lockhart would cease to be a qspe and would be required to be consolidated 

  

if zions bank had been required to purchase all of lockhart’s assets with a book value of 21 billion at december 31 2007 its consolidated total riskbased capital ratio as of december 31 2007 would have been reduced by approximately 25 basis points but would nonetheless have remained above the “wellcapitalized” threshold and its consolidated tangible equity ratio as of december 31 2007 would have been reduced by approximately 16 basis points as of february 15 2008 total lockhart assets were approximately 19 billion and the company owned 13 billion of lockhart commercial paper the company has adequate liquidity and borrowing capacity to fund the net additional 06 billion necessary to purchase the lockhart assets if it were required given that the company has 53 billion of assets the potential consolidation of lockhart would not be significant to the company we do not believe that consolidation of lockhart or the purchase of the remaining lockhart assets in and of itself would directly result in credit ratings downgrades or affect the company’s common or preferred dividend payments

risk elements 

  

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is integral to those operations and is also a key determinant of the company’s overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

  

credit risk management 

  

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower or contractual counterparty to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from offbalance sheet credit instruments 

  

credit risk is managed centrally through a uniform credit policy credit administration and credit exam functions at the parent effective management of credit risk is essential in maintaining a safe sound and profitable financial institution we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio further an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to management and to the credit review committee of the board of directors 

  

  

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each bank is able to modify corporate credit policy to be more conservative however corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to create a more liberal policy historically only a limited number of such modifications have been approved this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

  

with regard to credit risk associated with counterparties in offbalance sheet credit instruments zions bank has international swap dealer association “isda” agreements in place under which derivative transactions are entered into with major derivative dealers each isda agreement details the collateral arrangement between zions bank and its counterparty in every case the amount of the collateral required to secure the exposed party in the derivative transaction is determined by the marktomarket exposure on the derivative and the credit rating of the party with the obligation the credit rating used in these situations is provided by either moody’s or standard  poor’s this means that a counterparty with an “aaa” rating would be obligated to provide less collateral to secure a major credit exposure to zions bank than one with an “a” rating all derivative gains and losses between zions bank and a single counterparty are netted to determine the net credit exposure and therefore the collateral required we have no significant exposure to credit default swaps 

  

the company also has offbalance sheet credit risk associated with a liquidity agreement provided by zions bank to the qspe securities conduit lockhart see “offbalance sheet arrangements” page 85 for further details on lockhart 

  

the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular industry trade group or property type or with an individual customer or counterparty the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers located within the geographical footprint of its banking subsidiaries see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on concentrations of credit risk 

  

the company’s credit risk management strategy includes diversification of its loan portfolio the company maintains a diversified loan portfolio with some emphasis in real estate as displayed in schedule 34 at yearend 2007 no single loan type exceeded 25 of the company’s total loan portfolio 

  

schedule 34 

  

loan portfolio diversification 

  

   

in addition as reflected in schedule 35 as of december 31 2007 the commercial real estate loan portfolio totaling 136 billion is also well diversified by property type purpose and collateral location 

  

  

schedule 35 

  

commercial real estate portfolio by property type and collateral location 

represents percentages based upon outstanding commercial real estate loans 

at december 31 2007 

  

   

note excludes approximately 566 million of unsecured loans outstanding but related to the real estate industry 

  

loantovalue “ltv” ratios are another key determinant of credit risk in commercial real estate lending the company estimates that the weighted average ltv ratio on the total commercial real estate portfolio at june 30 2007 detailed in yearend amounts in schedule 35 was approximately 595 this estimate is based on the most current appraisals generally obtained as of the date of origination downgrade or renewal of the loans 

  

the company does not pursue subprime or alternative “alta” residential mortgage lending and has little or no direct exposure to that market however lending to finance residential land acquisition development and construction is a core business for the company in some geographic markets significant declines in the availability of subprime residential first mortgages to buyers of newly constructed homes are having an adverse impact on the operations of some of the company’s developer and builder customers 

  

as discussed in the following sections the company’s level of credit quality weakened during 2007 although it remained relatively strong compared to historical company and industry standards the deterioration in credit quality was mainly related to the continuing weakness in residential land acquisition development and construction activity in the southwest 

  

nonperforming assets 

  

nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans loans restructured at other than market terms other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection consumer loans are not normally placed on a nonaccrual status inasmuch as they are generally charged off when they become 120 days past due loans occasionally may be restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments this generally occurs when the financial condition of a borrower deteriorates to the point where the borrower needs to be given temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan other real estate owned is acquired primarily through or in lieu of foreclosure on loans secured by real estate 

  

as reflected in schedule 36 the company’s nonperforming assets as a percentage of net loans and leases and other real estate owned increased significantly during 2007 the percentage was 073 at december 31 2007 compared with 024 on december 31 2006 and 030 on december 31 2005 total nonperforming assets were 284 million at yearend 2007 compared to 82 million at december 31 2006 and 89 million at december 31 2005 

  

total nonaccrual loans at december 31 2007 increased 192 million from the balances at december 31 2006 which included increases of 147 million for construction and land development loans and 33 million for commercial and industrial loans the increase in nonaccrual construction and land development loans was primarily in arizona california and nevada reflecting the continuing weakness in residential development and construction activity in those states we expect this weakness to continue in 2008 

  

schedule 36 

  

nonperforming assets 

  

   

   

included in nonaccrual loans are loans that we have determined to be impaired loans other than those included in large groups of smallerbalance homogeneous loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the 

  

company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement including scheduled interest payments the amount of the impairment is measured based on either the present value of expected cash flows the observable fair value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan 

  

the company’s total recorded investment in impaired loans was 226 million at december 31 2007 and 47 million at december 31 2006 estimated losses on impaired loans are included in the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2007 the allowance included 21 million for impaired loans with a recorded investment of 103 million at december 31 2006 the allowance for loan losses included 6 million for impaired loans with a recorded investment of 18 million see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on impaired loans 

  

allowance and reserve for credit losses 

  

allowance for loan losses  in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

  

for commercial loans we use historical loss experience factors by loan segment adjusted for changes in trends and conditions to help determine an indicated allowance for each portfolio segment these factors are evaluated and updated using migration analysis technique and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific segment these other considerations include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to the segment evaluations nonaccrual loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of 500 thousand or more are individually evaluated in accordance with sfas no 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan to determine the level of impairment and establish a specific reserve a specific allowance is established for loans adversely graded loans below 500 thousand when it is determined that the risk associated with the loan differs significantly from the risk factor amounts established for its loan segment 

  

the allowance for consumer loans is determined using historically developed experience rates at which loans migrate from one delinquency level to the next higher level using average roll rates for the most recent twelvemonth period and comparing projected losses to actual loss experience the model estimates expected losses in dollars for the forecasted period by refreshing the model with updated data it is able to project losses for a new twelvemonth period each month segmenting the portfolio into nine product groupings with similar risk profiles this methodology is an accepted industry practice and the company believes it has a sufficient volume of information to produce reliable projections 

  

as a final step to the evaluation process we perform an additional review of the adequacy of the allowance based on the loan portfolio in its entirety this enables us to mitigate the imprecision inherent in most estimates of expected credit losses this review of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any adjustments necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excessive concentration risks 

  

the methodology used by amegy to estimate its allowance for loan losses has not yet been conformed to the process used by the other affiliate banks however the process used by amegy is not significantly different than the process used by our other affiliate banks 

  

the company has initiated a comprehensive review of its allowance for loan losses methodology with a view toward updating and conforming this methodology across all of its banking subsidiaries the company began implementing this updated methodology in 2007 and expects to complete the implementation in 2009

the total allowance for loan losses at december 31 2007 increased 94 million from the level at yearend 2006 for 2007 the amount of the allowance included for criticized and classified commercial and commercial real estate loans increased 63 million compared to 3 million for 2006 of this increase 22 million was for construction and land development loans reflecting the weaker credit conditions in the southwestern residential real estate markets as previously discussed 19 million was for commercial lending and 22 million was for other commercial real estate loans the level of the allowance for noncriticized and classified commercial loans increased 19 million for 2007 compared to an increase of 24 million for 2006 the increase in the level of the allowance indicated for noncriticized and classified loans for both 2007 and 2006 was mainly a result of 39 billion of new commercial and commercial real estate loan growth during 2007 and 45 billion of growth during 2006 the allowance for consumer loans and other receivables increased 12 million compared to december 31 2006 at december 31 2007 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases outstanding increased to 118 compared to 105 at december 31 2006 this increase reflects the previously discussed softening in our credit quality indicators and our concerns regarding the economy particularly the outlook for residential land development and construction 

  

reserve for unfunded lending commitments  the company also estimates a reserve for potential losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit the reserve is included with other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet with any related increases or decreases in the reserve included in noninterest expense in the statement of income 

  

we determine the reserve for unfunded lending commitments using a process that is similar to the one we use for commercial loans based on historical experience we have developed experiencebased loss factors that we apply to the company’s unfunded lending commitments to estimate the potential for loss in that portfolio these factors are generated from tracking commitments that become funded and develop into problem loans 

  

schedule 39 sets forth the reserve for unfunded lending commitments

interest rate and market risk management 

  

interest rate and market risk are managed centrally interest rate risk is the potential for reduced income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates on the company’s net interest income market risk is the potential for reduced income arising from adverse changes in fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

  

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company the boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board must understand the key strategies set by management for managing risk establish and periodically revise policy limits and review reported limit exceptions the board has established the management assetliability committee “alco” to which it has delegated the functional management of interest rate and market risk for the company alco’s primary responsibilities include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have the net interest margin increase slightly in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being slightly “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise 

  

we monitor this risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods duration of equity and income simulation in the duration of equity method we measure the expected changes in the fair values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the income simulation method we analyze the expected changes in income in response to changes in interest rates 

  

duration of equity is derived by first calculating the dollar duration of all assets liabilities and derivative instruments dollar duration is determined by calculating the fair value of each instrument assuming interest rates sustain immediate and parallel movements up 1 and down 1 the average of these two changes in fair value is the dollar duration subtracting the dollar duration of liabilities from the dollar duration of assets and adding the net dollar duration of derivative instruments results in the dollar duration of equity duration of equity is computed by dividing the dollar duration of equity by the fair value of equity 

  

income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income is measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio 

  

both of these measurement methods require that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics 

  

of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of duration and income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is managed actively to try to maintain a consistent slightly assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

  

we should note that estimated duration of equity and the income simulation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these estimates we view both the duration of equity and the income simulation results as falling within a range of possibilities 

  

for income simulation company policy requires that interest sensitive income from a static balance sheet is expected to decline by no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 basis points 

  

as of the dates indicated schedule 41 shows the company’s estimated range of duration of equity and percentage change in interest sensitive income in the first year after the rate change if interest rates were to sustain an immediate parallel change of 200 basis points the “low” and “high” results differ based on the assumed speed of repricing of administeredrate deposits money market interestonchecking and savings 

  

schedule 41 

  

duration of equity and interest sensitive income 

  

   

as discussed previously under the section “net interest income margin and interest rate spreads” the company believes that in recent quarters the dynamic balance sheet changes with regard to changes in the mix of deposits and other funding sources have tended to have a somewhat larger effect on the net interest spread and net interest margin than has the company’s interest rate risk position in addition as also discussed in that section competitive pressures on deposit rates may impede our ability to reprice deposits which did have a negative impact on the net interest margin during the third and fourth quarter of 2007 during those quarters deposits repriced even more slowly than our modeled “low” case as market disruptions and funding pressures experienced by many financial institutions kept market deposit prices from falling as much as expected when the federal reserve board began reducing shortterm interest rates 

  

we attempt to minimize the impact of changing interest rates will have on net interest income primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and by avoiding large exposures to fixed rate interestearning assets that have significant negative convexity the prime lending rate and libor curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

  

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at the end of 2007 approximately 75 of the company’s commercial loan and commercial real estate portfolios were floating rate and primarily tied to either prime or libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have floating interest rates this means that these loans reprice quickly in response to changes in interest rates – more quickly on average than does their funding base this posture results in a natural position that is more “assetsensitive” than the company believes is desirable 

  

the company attempts to mitigate this tendency toward asset sensitivity primarily through the use of interest rate swaps we have contracted to convert most of the company’s fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt through the use of interest rate swaps see fair value hedges in schedule 42 more importantly we engage in an ongoing program of swapping primebased and liborbased loans for “receive fixed” contracts at yearend 2007 the company had a notional amount of approximately 34 billion of such cash flow hedge contracts the company expects to continue to add new “receive fixed” swap contracts as its primebased loan portfolio grows these swaps also expose the company to counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk the company’s approach to managing this risk is discussed in “credit risk management” on page 88 the company retains basis risk due to changes between the prime rate and libor on nonhedge derivative basis swaps see “critical accounting policies and significant estimates – accounting for derivatives” on page 41 for further details about our derivative instruments 

  

schedule 42 presents a profile of the current interest rate swap portfolio for additional information regarding derivative instruments including fair values at december 31 2007 refer to notes 1 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

interest rate swaps – yearend balances and average rates 

  

   

   

note balances are based upon the portfolio at december 31 2007 excludes interest rate swap products that we provide as a service to our customers 

  

market risk – fixed income 

  

the company engages in the underwriting and trading of municipal and corporate securities this trading activity exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities held by the company 

  

at december 31 2007 trading account assets had been reduced to 218 million and securities sold not yet purchased were 2243 million the higher level of securities sold not yet purchased is related to an amegy bank sweep product 

  

at yearend 2007 the company made a market in 493 fixed income securities through zions bank and its whollyowned subsidiary zions direct inc during 2007 69 of all trades were executed electronically the company is an oddlot securities dealer which means that most corporate security trades are for less than 250000 

  

the company also is exposed to market risk which incorporates credit risk through changes in fair value of availableforsale securities and interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk changes in fair value in both of these categories are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss “oci” each quarter during 2007 the change in oci attributable to availableforsale securities was 904 million and the change attributable to interest rate swaps was 1069 million for a net increase in shareholders’ equity of 165 million if any of the availableforsale securities becomes otherthantemporarily impaired the loss in oci is reversed and the impairment is charged to operations 

  

market risk – equity investments 

  

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded and subject to fluctuations in their market prices or values in addition the company owns equity securities in companies that are not publicly traded that are accounted for under cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs in any case the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since these market prices or values may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss these equity investments are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

  

the company generally conducts minority investing in prepublic venture capital companies in which it does not have strategic involvement through four funds collectively referred to as epic venture funds “epic” formerly wasatch venture funds epic screens investment opportunities and makes investment decisions based on its assessment of business prospects and potential returns after an investment is made epic actively monitors the performance of each company in which it has invested and often has representation on the board of directors of the company net of expenses income tax effects and minority interest gains were 34 million in 2007 and 41 million in 2006 and losses were 22 million in 2005 the company’s remaining equity exposure to investments held by epic net of related minority interest and sba debt at december 31 2007 was approximately 400 million compared to approximately 491 million at december 31 2006 

  

in addition to the program described above amegy has in place an alternative investments program these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds generally are not part of the strategy since the underlying companies are typically not credit worthy the carrying value of the investments at december 31 2007 was 374 million compared to 196 million at december 31 2006 the company has a total remaining funding commitment of 1017 million to sbic nonsbic hedge funds and private equity investments as of december 31 2007 this funding commitment is primarily at amegy totaling 764 million 

  

the company also from time to time either starts and funds businesses of a strategic nature or makes significant investments in companies of strategic interest these investments may result in either minority or majority ownership positions and usually give the parent or its subsidiaries board representation these strategic investments are in companies that are financial services or financial technologies providers examples include contango netdeposit and p5 all of which are majority or whollyowned by the company and insurecom and identrust in which the company owns a significant but minority position 

  

liquidity risk 

  

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

  

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy that is adhered to by the parent and the subsidiary banks this policy includes guidelines by which liquidity and funding are managed these guidelines address maintaining liquidity needs diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and bank subsidiaries 

  

managing liquidity and funding is performed centrally by zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for making any recommended changes to existing funding plans as well as to the policy guidelines these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and potentially to the company’s board of directors the subsidiary banks only have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and the federal reserve and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer but are not involved in any other funding decision processes 

  

contractual obligations 

  

schedule 43 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2007 

  

schedule 43 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

      

as of december 31 2007 there were no minimum required pension plan contributions and no discretionary or noncash contributions are currently planned as a result no amounts have been included in the schedule above for future pension plan contributions 

  

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in the previous schedule the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

  

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive cash or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change for further information on derivative contracts see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

pension obligations 

  

as of december 31 2007 the market value of the company’s pension plan assets was 1412 million and the benefit obligation as of that date was 1528 million as measured with an annual discount rate of 60 this means that the pension plan is underfunded in the amount of 116 million this underfunding is recorded as a liability on the companys balance sheet since no new employees can be added to the plan and future benefit accruals were eliminated for most participants effective january 1 2003 this unfunded condition should decrease over time as the market value of plan assets is expected to appreciate faster than the benefit obligation although fluctuations in plan asset values could cause the unfunded amount to either increase or decrease over shorter time periods as a result the company does not anticipate a need to make any cash contributions to the plan in the near future however certain changes to federal laws and regulations governing defined benefit plans could change the company’s need to make future cash contributions 

  

liquidity management actions 

  

the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investments in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes dividends to shareholders and share repurchases the parent’s cash needs are routinely met through dividends from its subsidiaries interest and investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes management and other fees bank lines equity contributed through the exercise of stock options commercial paper and longterm debt and equity issuances the subsidiaries’ primary source of funding is their core deposits operational cash flows while constituting a funding source for the company are not large enough to provide funding in the amounts that fulfill the needs of the parent and the bank subsidiaries for 2007 operations contributed 733 million toward these needs as a result the company utilizes other sources at its disposal to manage its liquidity needs 

  

during 2007 the parent received 461 million in dividends from various subsidiaries at december 31 2007 the banking subsidiaries could pay 304 million of dividends to the parent under regulatory guidelines without the need for regulatory approval the amounts of dividends the banking subsidiaries can pay to the parent are restricted by earnings retained earnings and riskbased capital requirements the dividend capacity is dependent on the continued profitability of the subsidiary banks and no significant changes in the current regulatory environment while we have no current expectation that these two conditions will change should a change take place to either in the future this source of funding to the parent may become more limited or even unavailable see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of dividend capacities and limitations 

  

for the year 2007 issuances of mediumterm and longterm debt exceeded repayments of longterm debt resulting in net cash inflows of 21 million from debt financing activities specific longterm debtrelated activities for 2007 are as follows 

  

   

      

see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of the company’s longterm borrowings 

  

on a consolidated basis fundings from shortterm borrowings exceeded repayments excluding shortterm fhlb borrowings and resulted in a 1079 million source of cash in 2007 the parent has a program to issue shortterm commercial paper and at december 31 2007 outstanding commercial paper was 298 million in addition the parent has secured revolving credit facilities totaling 153 million with two subsidiary banks these revolving credit facilities are limited to the amount of pledged securities the parent holds for these credit facilities no amount was outstanding on these facilities at december 31 2007 

  

the parent plans to arrange new borrowing lines from its banking subsidiaries that are collateralized with municipal securities owned by a subsidiary and hypothecated to the parent this funding source can provide up to 297 million of new borrowing capacity based on asset values as of december 31 2007 

  

access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is directly tied to the credit ratings they receive from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the parent and its three largest banking subsidiaries had the following ratings as of december 31 2007 

  

schedule 44 

  

credit ratings 

  

parent company 

  

   

three largest banking subsidiaries 

  

   

on february 28 2008 moody’s downgraded its ratings for the parent on longterm issuersenior debt to a3 on subordinated debt to baal and on shorttermcommercial paper to p2 it also changed its outlook from negative to stable also moody’s downgraded its ratings for the three largest banking subsidiaries on longterm issuersenior debt and certificate of deposit to a2 affirmed the shorttermcommercial paper rating of p1 and changed its outlook from negative to stable 

  

the subsidiaries’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2007 these core deposits in aggregate constituted 881 of consolidated deposits compared with 877 of consolidated deposits at december 31 2006 for 2007 deposit increases resulted in net cash inflows of 931 million which primarily resulted from a 978 million increase in internet money market deposits 

  

the fhlb system is also a significant source of liquidity for the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank and tcbw are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nba are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity requirements for 2007 the activity in shortterm fhlb borrowings resulted in a net cash inflow of 2664 million amounts of unused lines of credit available for additional fhlb advances totaled 35 billion at december 31 2007 an additional 13 billion could be borrowed upon the pledging of additional available collateral borrowings from the fhlb may increase in the future depending on availability of funding from other sources such as deposits however the subsidiary banks must maintain their fhlb memberships to continue accessing this source of funding 

  

in december 2007 the federal reserve board announced a new program to make 28 day loans to banks in the united states and to foreign banks through foreign central banks these loans are made using an auction process zions bank is currently participating in this new program and will continue to do so as long as money can be borrowed at an attractive rate the amount that can be borrowed 

  

is based upon the amount of collateral that has been pledged to the federal reserve bank at december 31 2007 450 million in borrowings were outstanding at zions bank under this program at december 31 2007 the amount available for additional federal reserve borrowings was approximately 23 billion an additional 57 billion could be borrowed upon the pledging of additional available collateral 

  

zions bank has in prior years used asset securitizations to sell loans and provide a flexible alternative source of funding as a qspe securities conduit sponsored by zions bank lockhart has purchased and held creditenhanced securitized assets resulting from certain small business loan securitizations zions bank provides a liquidity facility to lockhart for a fee lockhart purchases floatingrate us government and aaarated securities including securities resulting from zions bank’s small business loan securitizations with funds from the issuance of commercial paper 

  

due to the disruptions in the assetbacked commercial paper markets that began in august 2007 and continued into 2008 lockhart was unable to issue commercial paper sufficient to fund its assets and the company and its banks purchased lockhart commercial paper and held it on their balance sheets the company was also required to purchase assets under the liquidity agreement due to security ratings downgrades and the inability of lockhart to issue commercial paper see “offbalance sheet arrangements” beginning on page 85 for information about lockhart and the liquidity agreement this includes details of the purchase of commercial paper and securities and the possible effect on the company’s liquidity and capital ratios if lockhart was required to be consolidated or the company was required to purchase its remaining securities 

  

while not considered a primary source of funding the company’s investment activities can also provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture that is being observed for 2007 investment securities activities resulted in net cash outflows of 414 million 

  

maturing balances in the various loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows in most cases however loan growth has resulted in net cash outflows from a funding standpoint for 2007 loan growth resulted in a net cash outflow of 39 billion compared to 49 billion in 2006 we expect that loans will continue to be a use of funding rather than a source in 2008 

  

operational risk management 

  

operational risk is the potential for unexpected losses attributable to human error systems failures fraud or inadequate internal controls and procedures in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has created a corporate risk management department whose responsibility is to help company management identify and assess key risks and monitor the key internal controls and processes that the company has in place to mitigate operational risk we have documented controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

  

to manage and minimize its operating risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments in addition reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we maintain contingency plans and systems for operations support in the event of natural or other disasters efforts are underway to improve the company’s oversight at operational risk including enhancement of riskcontrol self assessments and of antifraud measures 

  

capital management 

  

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company other major cmc responsibilities include 

  

    

the cmc in managing the capital of the company may set capital standards that are higher than those approved by the board but may not set lower limits 

  

the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

  

      

see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on riskbased capital 

  

in december 2006 the company resumed its common stock repurchase plan which had been suspended since july 2005 because of the amegy acquisition on december 11 2006 the board authorized a 400 million repurchase program the company repurchased 

  

and retired 3933128 shares of its common stock in 2007 at a total cost of 3188 million and an average per share price of 8104 under this share repurchase authorization the remaining authorized amount for share repurchases as of december 31 2007 was 563 million the company has not repurchased any shares since august 16 2007 and suspended its common stock repurchase program in order to conserve capital due to the continuing capital market disruptions and uncertainties regarding economic conditions in 2008 the company does not currently expect to resume repurchases of its common stock until late 2008 or beyond depending on economic conditions and the company’s financial performance 

  

in 2006 common stock repurchases under repurchase plans totaled 308359 shares at a total cost of 250 million the company also repurchased 32 million in 2007 and 15 million in 2006 of shares related to the company’s restricted stock employee compensation program 

  

during its january 2008 meeting the board of directors declared a dividend of 043 per common share payable on february 20 2008 to shareholders of record on february 6 2008 the company paid dividends in 2007 of 168 per common share compared with 147 per share in 2006 and 144 per share in 2005 

  

in 2007 the company paid dividends of 1813 million on its common stock and used 3220 million to repurchase common stock of the company in total we returned to shareholders 5033 million out of total net income of 4937 million or 1019 the company paid 1570 million in dividends on common stock in 2006 and used 265 million to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock in total we returned to shareholders 1835 million out of total net income of 5831 million or 315 

  

  

total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2007 increased to 53 billion an increase of 61 over the 50 billion at december 31 2006 tangible equity including noncumulative preferred stock was 31 billion at the end of 2007 and 29 billion at the end of 2006 

  

on december 7 2006 the company issued 240 million of depositary shares the 9600000 depositary shares each represent a 140th ownership interest in a share of series a floatingrate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock the issuance was priced at an annual rate equal to the greater of threemonth libor plus 052 or 4 the series a preferred stock is not redeemable prior to december 15 2011 on and after that date the series a preferred stock will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to 1000 per share equivalent to 25 per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends without accumulation of any undeclared dividends 

  

the company declared preferred stock dividends of 143 million during 2007 compared to 38 million during 2006 

  

the company has stated that its longterm target for its tangible equity ratios is 625  650 the company’s capital ratios were as follows at december 31 2007 and 2006 

  

schedule 45 

  

capital ratios 

  

   

the decreased capital ratios at december 31 2007 compared to december 31 2006 reflect the impact of the strong loan growth during the year common stock repurchases and the lower earnings for 2007 

  

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskcapital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply in january 2001 the bcbs released a proposal to replace basel i with a new capital framework “basel ii” that would set capital requirements for operational risk and materially change the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures operational risk is defined by the proposal as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events basel i does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 

  

in september 2006 the us banking regulators issued an interagency advance notice of proposed rulemaking “npr” with regard to the us implementation of the basel ii framework published in december 2007 the final rule requires banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other banks to elect to “opt in” we do not currently expect to be an early “opt in” bank holding company as the company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt the advanced approach however we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to companies that do adopt the advanced approach may make it necessary for the company to elect to “opt in” at some point and we have begun investing in the required capabilities and required data 

  

also in july 2007 the us banking regulators agreed to issue a proposed rule that would provide noncore banks with the option of adopting the standardized approach proposed in basel ii this replaces the proposed basel 1a framework which has been withdrawn while the advanced approach uses sophisticated mathematical models to measure and assign capital to specific risks the standardized approach categorizes risks by type and then assigns capital requirements following the publication of the proposed rule the company will evaluate the benefit of adopting the standardized approach

competition 

  

the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks thrifts and credit unions including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the internet and other means in addition the company competes with finance companies mutual funds brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies financial technology firms and a variety of other types of companies many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures 

  

the primary factors in competing for business include pricing convenience of office locations and other delivery methods range of products offered and the level of service delivered the company must compete effectively along all of these parameters to remain successful 

  

supervision and regulation 

  

the grammleachbliley act of 1999 “the glb act” provides a regulatory framework for financial holding companies which have as their umbrella regulator the federal reserve board “frb” the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a holding company is conducted by each subsidiary’s primary functional regulator to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company a company must satisfy certain ongoing criteria 

  

the glb act also provides federal regulations dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal information of individual customers with which the company must comply in addition the company is subject to various other federal and state laws that deal with the use and disclosure of nonpublic personal information 

  

the parent is a financial holding company and as such is subject to the bhc act the bhc act requires the prior approval of the frb for a financial holding company to acquire or hold more than 5 voting interest in any bank the bhc act allows subject to certain limitations interstate bank acquisitions and interstate branching by acquisition anywhere in the country 

  

the bhc act restricts the company’s nonbanking activities to those that are permitted for financial holding companies or that have been determined by the frb to be financial in nature incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity the bhc act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies 

  

the company’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to various requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the united states and the states in which the banks operate these include restrictions on 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the company’s subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or the banking laws of their respective states as well as the rules and regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” they are also under the supervision of and are subject to periodic examination by the occ or their respective state banking departments the frb and the fdic 

  

the frb has established capital guidelines for financial holding companies the occ the fdic and the frb have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks failure to meet capital requirements could subject the company and its subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement remedies see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding capital requirements 

  

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply the bcbs has been working for a number of years on revisions to basel i and in june 2004 released the final version of its proposed new capital framework with an update in november 2005 “basel ii” basel ii provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk – an internal ratingsbased approach tailored to individual institutions’ circumstances which for many asset classes is itself broken into a “foundation” approach and an “advanced” or “airb” approach the availability of which is subject to additional restrictions and a standardized approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in existing riskbased capital guidelines basel ii also would set capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures however us regulatory authorities consistently have taken the position that us banks would not be permitted to utilize the “foundation” approach operational risk is defined by the proposal to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events basel i does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 

  

in september 2006 the us banking and thrift agencies issued an interagency advance notice of proposed rulemaking “npr” setting forth a definitive proposal for implementing basel ii in the united states that would apply only to internationally active banking organizations – defined as those with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or consolidated onbalance sheet 

  

foreign exposures of 10 billion or more – but that other us banking organizations could elect but would not be required to apply we do not currently expect to be an early “opt in” bank holding company as the company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt basel ii however we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to companies that do adopt the framework will make it necessary for the company to elect to “opt in” at some point and we have begun investing in the required capabilities 

  

also in december 2006 the agencies issued another npr for modifications to the basel i framework for those banks not adopting basel ii called basel ia the basel ia npr will allow nonbasel ii banking organizations the choice of adopting all of the revisions suggested in the proposed npr or continuing the use of existing riskbased capital rules the agencies have indicated their intent to have the airb provisions for internationally active us banking organizations first become effective in march 2009 and that those provisions and the basel ia provisions for others will be implemented on similar time frames 

  

dividends payable by the subsidiary banks to the parent are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions these restrictions and the amount available for the payment of dividends at yearend are summarized in note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 provides that the company’s bank subsidiaries are liable for any loss incurred by the fdic in connection with the failure of an affiliated insured bank 

  

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 prescribes standards for the safety and soundness of insured banks these standards relate to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulatory agencies 

  

the community reinvestment act “cra” requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities including credit to low and moderate income individuals should the company or its subsidiaries fail to adequately serve their communities penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates and merge with or purchase other financial institutions the glb act requires “satisfactory” or higher cra compliance for insured depository institutions and their financial holding companies for them to engage in new financial activities if one of the company’s banks should receive a cra rating of less than satisfactory the company could lose its status as a financial holding company 

  

on october 26 2001 the president signed into law comprehensive antiterrorism legislation known as the usa patriot act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” title iii of the usa patriot act substantially broadens the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations defining new crimes and related penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states the us treasury department has issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions the company’s bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by the company’s subsidiaries must comply with these regulations these regulations also impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 

  

the company has adopted appropriate policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of these acts and will continue to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required 

  

regulators congress and state legislatures continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and to protect consumers the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

  

on july 30 2002 the senate and the house of representatives of the united states congress enacted the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 a law that addresses among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information the nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

  

the board of directors of the parent has implemented a system of strong corporate governance practices this system includes corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics for employees a directors code of conduct and charters for the audit credit review executive compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on the company’s corporate governance practices is available on the company’s website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  the company’s website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 

  

government monetary policies 

  

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by fiscal and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which affect shortterm interest rates and the national supply of bank credit the methods of monetary policy available to the frb include 

  

   

   

   

these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

  

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

executive summary 

  

company overview 

  

zions bancorporation “the parent” and subsidiaries collectively “the company” “zions” “we” “our” “us” together comprise a 47 billion financial holding company headquartered in salt lake city utah the company is the twentysecond largest domestic bank in terms of deposits operating banking businesses through 470 offices and 578 atms in ten western and southwestern states arizona california colorado idaho nevada new mexico oregon texas utah and washington our banking businesses include zions first national bank “zions bank” in utah and idaho california bank  trust “cbt” amegy corporation “amegy” and its subsidiary amegy bank in texas national bank of arizona “nba” nevada state bank “nsb” vectra bank colorado “vectra” in colorado and new mexico the commerce bank of washington “tcbw” and the commerce bank of oregon “tcbo” 

  

the company also operates a number of specialty financial services and financial technology businesses that conduct business on a regional or national scale the company is a national leader in small business administration “sba” lending public finance advisory services and software sales and cash management services related to “check 21 act” electronic imaging and clearing of checks in addition zions is included in the sp 500 and nasdaq financial 100 indices 

  

in operating its banking businesses the company seeks to combine the advantages that it believes can result from decentralized organization and branding with those that can come from centralized risk management capital management and operations in its specialty financial services and technology businesses the company seeks to develop a competitive advantage in a particular product customer or technology niche 

  

banking businesses 

  

as shown in charts 1 and 2 the company’s loans and core deposits are widely diversified among the banking franchises the company operates 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

we believe that the company distinguishes itself by having a strategy for growth in its banking businesses that is unique for a bank holding company of its size this growth strategy is driven by three key factors 1 focus on high growth markets 2 keep decisions about customers local and 3 centralize technology and operations to achieve economies of scale 

  

focus on high growth markets 

  

each of the states in which the company conducts its banking businesses has experienced relatively high levels of historical economic growth and each ranks among the top onethird of the fastest growing states as projected by the us census bureau in addition in the recent past these states have experienced relatively high levels of population growth compared to the rest of the country 

  

schedule 1 

  

demographic profile 

by state 

  

   

    

the company seeks to grow both organically and through acquisitions in these banking markets in 2005 we acquired amegy bank in texas which continued to enjoy very strong organic growth through 2006 in september 2006 we announced the pending acquisition of the stockmen’s bancorp inc “stockmen’s” a bank holding company with 12 billion in assets headquartered in kingman arizona on january 17 2007 this acquisition was completed and stockmen’s banking subsidiary the stockmen’s bank was merged into our nba affiliate bank 

  

within each of the states that the company operates we focus on the market segments that we believe present the best opportunities for us we believe that these states have experienced higher rates of growth business formation and expansion than other states we also believe that these states will continue to experience higher rates of commercial real estate development as local businesses strive to provide housing shopping business facilities and other amenities for their growing populations as a result a common focus of all of zions’ subsidiary banks is small and middle market business banking including the personal banking needs of the executives and employees of those businesses and commercial real estate development in many cases the company’s relationship with its customers is primarily driven by the goal to satisfy their needs for credit to finance their expanding business opportunities in addition to our commercial business we also provide a broad base of consumer financial products in selected markets including home mortgages home equity lines auto loans and credit cards this mix of business often leads to loan balances growing faster than internally generated deposits in addition it has important implications for the company’s management of certain risks including interest rate and liquidity risks which are discussed further in later sections of this document 

  

keep decisions about customers local 

  

the company operates eight different communityregional banks each under a different name each with its own charter and each with its own chief executive officer and management team this structure helps to ensure that decisions related to customers are made at a local level in addition each bank controls among other things all decisions related to its branding market strategies customer relationships product pricing and credit decisions within the limits of established corporate policy in this way we are able to differentiate our banks from much larger “mass market” banking competitors that operate regional or national franchises under a common brand and often around “vertical” product silos we believe that this approach allows us to attract and retain exceptional management and that it also results in providing service of the highest quality to our targeted customers in addition we believe that over time this strategy generates superior growth in our banking businesses 

  

centralize technology and operations to achieve economies of scale 

  

we seek to differentiate the company from smaller banks in two ways first we use the combined scale of all of the banking operations to create a broad product offering without the fragmentation of systems and operations that would typically drive up costs second for certain products for which economies of scale are believed to be important the company “manufactures” the product centrally or outsources it from a third party examples include cash management credit card administration mortgage servicing and deposit operations in this way the company seeks to create and maintain efficiencies while generating superior growth 

  

specialty financial services and technology businesses 

  

in addition to its community and regional banking businesses the company operates a number of specialized businesses that in many cases are national in scope these include a number of businesses in which the company believes it ranks in the top ten institutions nationally such as sba 7a loan originations sba 504 lending public finance advisory and underwriting services software and cash management services related to the electronic imaging of checks pursuant to the check 21 act and the origination of farm mortgages sold to farmer mac 

  

high growth market opportunities are not always geographically defined the company continues to invest in several expanded or new initiatives that we believe present unusual opportunities for us including the following 

  

national real estate lending 

  

this business consists of making sba 504 and similar low loantovalue primarily owneroccupied first mortgage small business commercial loans during both 2006 and 2005 the company originated directly and purchased from correspondents approximately 12 billion of these loans during 2005 we securitized 707 million of these loans no securitization was completed during 2006 a qualifying specialpurpose entity “qspe” lockhart funding llc “lockhart” purchases the resultant securities after credit enhancement and funds them through the issuance of commercial paper 

  

netdeposit and related services 

  

netdeposit inc “netdeposit” is a subsidiary of the parent that was created to develop and sell software and processes that facilitate electronic check clearing with the implementation of the check 21 act late in 2004 this company and its products are well positioned to take advantage of the revolution in check processing now underway in america during 2006 netdeposit reduced earnings by 007 per diluted share compared to 008 per share in 2005 revenues for 2006 increased almost 90 from 2005 and we have continued to increase our investment in this business 

  

the company generates revenues in several ways from this business first netdeposit licenses software sells consulting services and resells scanners to other banks and processors newly announced customers since january 1 2006 include bok financial corporation deutsche bank first national bank of arizona and national city bank these activities initially generate revenue from scanner sales consulting and licensing fees deploymentrelated fees related to work station site licenses and check processing follow but have been slower to increase than expected as deployment throughout the industry has been slower than expected 

  

second netdeposit has licensed its software to the company’s banks which use the capabilities of the software to provide stateofthe art cash management services to business customers and to correspondent banks at yearend over 4500 zions affiliate bank cash management customers were using netdeposit and we processed over 85 billion of imaged checks from our cash management customers in the month of december 

  

third zions bank uses netdeposit software to provide checkclearing services to correspondent banks zions bank has contracts and comarketing agreements with a number of bank processors and resellers both domestically and abroad 

  

netdeposit seeks to protect its intellectual property in business methods related to the electronic processing and clearing of checks it has applied for several patents and was recently notified by the united states patent and trademark office that it has been granted two patents 

  

treasury management 

  

with the acquisition of amegy bank zions’ cash or treasury management capabilities were significantly enhanced zions believes that it has a significant opportunity to increase its treasury management penetration of commercial customers in its geographic territory and increased its investment in these capabilities in 2006 an increased level of investment in treasury management both in technology and service and in sales is expected to continue in 2007 

  

in addition to enhancing its general treasury management capabilities zions has made significant investments specifically in creating enhanced capabilities in services related to claims processing and reconciliation for medical providers included among these investments was the acquisition of the remaining minority interests in p5 inc “p5” zions had for several years owned a majority interest in this startup provider of webbased claims reconciliation services at yearend 2006 p5 provided these services to over 800 medical practitioners mostly pharmacy outlets the company is in the process of integrating p5’s services and other payment processing services into its more traditional treasury management products and services for the medical provider industry 

  

wealth management 

  

we have extensive relationships with small and middlemarket businesses and business owners that we believe present an unusual opportunity to offer wealth management services as a result the company established a wealth management business contango capital advisors inc “contango” and launched the business in the latter half of 2004 the business offers financial and tax planning trust and inheritance services overthecounter exchangetraded and synthetic derivative and hedging strategies quantitative asset allocation and risk management and a global array of investment strategies from equities and bonds through alternative and private equity investments at yearend contango had over 885 million of client assets under management and a strong pipeline of referrals from our affiliate banks as compared to over 170 million at december 31 2005 at december 31 2006 the company had total discretionary assets under management of 21 billion including assets managed by contango amegy and western national trust company a wholly owned subsidiary of zions bank during 2006 contango generated net losses of 007 per diluted share unchanged from 2005 we expect that net losses will decline in 2007 and that the business will approach breakeven late in 2007 or in 2008 

  

employee stock option appreciation rights 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment  which is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  we have developed a marketbased method for the valuation of employee stock options for sfas 123r purposes this method uses an online auction to price a tracking instrument that measures the fair value of the option grant on january 25 2007 we received notice from the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission “sec” that they concur with our view that our tracking instrument with modifications described in the notification is sufficiently designed to be used for sfas 123r zions did not use this method to value its 2006 grant however we intend to use the method to value our 2007 option grant we also intend to market this method as a service to other sec registrants 

  

management’s overview of 2006 performance 

  

the company’s primary or “core” business consists of providing community and regional banking services to both individuals and businesses in ten western and southwestern states we believe that this core banking business performed well during 2006 the company experienced strong organic loan growth of over 15 continued to experience excellent credit quality and maintained a high and stable net interest margin in a difficult rate environment 

  

on december 3 2005 we completed our acquisition of amegy bancorporation inc the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly results of operations for 2005 include the results of amegy only for the month of december all comparisons to 2005 and prior periods reflect the impact of the acquisition in may 2006 the conversion of amegy’s major systems to the zions technology and operations platform was completed 

  

in september 2006 the company announced the acquisition of the stockmen’s bancorp inc headquartered in kingman arizona this acquisition was completed on january 17 2007 consequently 2006 results were not impacted by the acquisition of stockmen’s but the acquisition will increase loans deposits revenue and expenses in 2007 as previously announced the company expects this acquisition to be about 003 dilutive to earnings per share in 2007 excluding merger related costs 

  

the company reported record earnings for 2006 of 5793 million or 536 per diluted common share this compares with 4801 million or 516 per diluted share for 2005 and 4060 million or 447 per share for 2004 return on average common equity was 1289 and return on average assets was 132 in 2006 compared with 1586 and 143 in 2005 and 1527 and 131 in 2004 

  

the key drivers of the company’s performance during 2006 were as follows 

  

schedule 2 

  

key drivers of performance 

2006 compared to 2005 

  

   

as illustrated by the previous schedule the company’s earnings growth in 2006 compared to 2005 reflected the following 

  

   

       

we believe that the performance the company experienced in 2006 was a direct result of our focusing on five primary objectives 1 organic loan and deposit growth 2 maintaining credit quality at high levels 3 managing interest rate risk 4 completing the conversion of amegy onto zions’ systems and 5 controlling expenses 

  

organic loan and deposit growth 

  

since 2002 the company has experienced steady and strong loan growth and moderate deposit growth augmented in 2005 and 2006 by the amegy acquisition we consider this performance to be a direct result of steadily improving economic conditions throughout most of our geographical footprint and of effectively executing our operating strategies chart 3 depicts this growth 

  

  

the company experienced strong loan growth in all of its markets early in 2006 however declining rates of residential housing development and construction in the west resulted in significantly slower rates of loan growth in its cbt nba and nsb subsidiaries in the latter half of the year in fact total loans outstanding in cbt and nsb actually declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2006 the company expects that the slower rate of residential development and construction lending will continue to result in much slower or no net loan growth in cbt nba and nsb in at least the first half of 2007 however commercial lending strengthened during 2006 particularly in zions bank and amegy but also in our vectra and tcbw bank subsidiaries and remained very strong in the latter half of the year the result was net loan growth of 45 billion or 151 from yearend 2006 compared to yearend 2005 and a mix shift away from commercial real estate and towards commercial lending sectors in new loan originations 

  

reflecting trends throughout the banking industry the company’s deposit growth in 2006 slowed significantly core deposits grew only 552 million from yearend 2005 a rate of 18 – significantly lagging the growth rate of loans in addition noninterestbearing 

  

demand deposits only increased by 56 million from yearend 2005 thus the company increased its reliance on more costly sources of funding during the year 

  

maintaining credit quality at high levels 

  

the ratio of nonperforming assets to net loans and other real estate owned improved to 024 at yearend compared to 030 at the end of 2005 net loan chargeoffs for 2006 were 46 million compared to 25 million for 2005 the provision for loan losses during 2006 significantly increased relative to 2005 driven in significant part by strong loan growth and the amegy acquisition the company believes that it is unlikely that credit quality will improve further from these yearend levels however it also sees little sign of significant deterioration in credit quality

managing interest rate risk 

  

our focus in managing interest rate risk is not to take positions based upon management’s forecasts of interest rates but rather to maintain a position of slight “assetsensitivity” this means that our assets tend to reprice slightly more quickly than our liabilities the company makes extensive use of interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk in order to seek to achieve this desired position this practice has enabled us to achieve a relatively stable net interest margin during periods of volatile interest rates which is depicted in chart 5 

  

taxableequivalent net interest income in 2006 increased 294 over 2005 excluding amegy from 2006 and december 2005 taxableequivalent net interest income increased 91 the net interest margin increased to 463 for 2006 up from 458 for 2005 the company was able to achieve this performance despite the challenges of a flattoinverted yield curve and significant pressures on both loan pricing and funding costs that resulted in fairly steady compression of the net interest spread the difference between the average yield on all interestearning assets and the average cost of all interestbearing funding sources

controlling expenses 

  

during 2006 the company’s efficiency ratio increased to 569 compared to 557 for 2005 the efficiency ratio is the relationship between noninterest expense and total taxableequivalent revenue the efficiency ratio deteriorated following the close of the amegy acquisition both due to amegy’s higher premerger efficiency ratio relative to zions and due to acquisition and integration related costs however after peaking in the first quarter the efficiency ratio improved as cost synergies were realized

capital and return on capital 

  

as regulated financial institutions the parent and its subsidiary banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios one of our goals is to maintain capital levels that are at least “well capitalized” under regulatory standards the company and each of its banking subsidiaries met the “well capitalized” guidelines at december 31 2006 in addition the parent and certain of its banking subsidiaries have issued various debt securities that have been rated by the principal rating agencies as a result another goal is to maintain capital at levels consistent with an “investment grade” rating for these debt securities the company has maintained its “investment grade” debt ratings as have those of its bank subsidiaries that have ratings at yearend 2006 the company’s tangible common equity ratio increased to 598 compared to 528 at the end of 2005 in december 2006 the company issued 240 million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock this additional capital raised the company’s tangible equity ratio to 651 at yearend the company announced in the fourth quarter that it would target a tangible equity ratio of 625  650 replacing the previously announced tangible common equity ratio target at the same level in conjunction with these actions the company’s board of directors authorized a 400 million common stock buyback program and the company repurchased 250 million of its common stock in december 2006 

  

  

the company continues to believe that capital in excess of that required to support the risks of the business in which it engages should be returned to the shareholders in addition to dividends the company currently expects to use the remaining 375 million stock buyback authorization during 2007 

  

  

in addition we believe that the company should engage or invest in business activities that provide attractive returns on equity chart 9 illustrates that as a result of earnings improvement the exit of underperforming businesses and returning unneeded capital to the shareholders the company’s return on average common equity has improved in recent years the decline in 2006 is due to the additional common equity held due to additional intangible assets primarily goodwill and core deposit intangibles that resulted from the premium paid to acquire amegy 

  

  

as depicted in chart 10 tangible return on average tangible common equity further improved in 2006 as the company continued to improve its core operating results 

  

  

note tangible return is net earnings applicable to common 

shareholders plus aftertax amortization of core deposit and 

other intangibles and impairment losses on goodwill 

  

challenges to operations 

  

as detailed in schedule 2 on page 21 several factors combined to improve the company’s performance in 2006 from 2005 the company continued to experience strong loan growth but deposit growth lagged the improving economic conditions that began in 2004 continued through 2005 and 2006 and spread to include essentially all of our markets during the past year however as noted growth in residential real estate development and construction slowed considerably in the second half of 2006 in arizona southern california and southern nevada credit quality remained exceptional during the year as nonperforming assets and net chargeoff percentages remained at historically low levels the company was able to slightly improve its net interest margin year over year during a period when other financial institutions were experiencing significant margin compression due to the challenging interest rate environment 

  

as we enter 2007 we see several significant challenges to improving performance 

  

we expect that commercial real estate loans which declined in cbt and nsb in the fourth quarter may continue to decline in our southwestern markets throughout the first half of 2007 however commercial loan growth has been accelerating particularly in zions bank amegy and vectra which has kept aggregate loan growth robust 

  

over the last two years the company has experienced historically high levels of credit quality while we do not see any indications that loan quality will deteriorate significantly it is unlikely we will be able to maintain credit quality at these levels for an indefinite period of time the 2006 annual provision for loan losses was 73 million an increase from 2005 of 30 million and we expect that loan loss provisions may continue in 2007 at levels similar to 2006 if loan growth remains strong 

  

during 2006 we saw increased pressure on the pricing of both loans and deposits as the economy continued to expand and competition for good business increased in particular deposit rates repriced upward at an increasing rate in the latter half of 2005 and first half of 2006 the federal reserve continued to raise shortterm interest rates and the competition for deposits intensified 

  

we expect these pressures to continue in 2007 although perhaps not as severely if the federal reserve does not raise interest rates further for more information on our assetliability management processes see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 86 

  

we anticipate that economic conditions will continue to be strong in our geographic footprint during 2007 with weakness in residential real estate as previously discussed however any number of unforeseen events could result in a weaker economy that in turn could negatively impact loan growth and credit quality 

  

excluding the impact of the stockmen’s acquisition we expect to see moderate growth in both revenues and expenses during 2007 and believe that controlling operating expenses will continue to be an important factor in improving our overall performance we will continue to see increased expense levels during 2007 for systems conversions at stockmen’s and cbt but we expect these conversions to result in ongoing expense savings when completed we are also investing in creating systems data and processes that may enable us to qualify for the proposed basel ii capital requirements 

  

compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing challenge a failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings but also on the perception that customers regulators and investors may have of the company we continue to devote a significant amount of effort time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with these complex regulations 

  

we have a number of business initiatives that while we believe they will ultimately produce profits for our shareholders currently generate expenses in excess of revenues three significant initiatives are contango a wealth management business started in 2004 netdeposit our subsidiary that provides electronic check processing systems and the increased investments in treasury management and medical claims capabilities discussed in the executive summary we will need to manage these businesses carefully to ensure that expenses and revenues develop in a planned way and that profits are not impaired to an extent that is not warranted by the opportunities these businesses provide 

  

finally competition from credit unions continues to pose a significant challenge the aggressive expansion of some credit unions far beyond the traditional concept of a common bond presents a competitive threat to zions and many other banking companies while this is an issue in all of our markets it is especially acute in utah where two of the five largest financial institutions measured by local deposits are credit unions that are exempt from all state and federal income tax 

  

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

  

the notes to consolidated financial statements contain a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies we believe that an understanding of certain of these policies along with the related estimates that we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the company is important in order to have a complete picture of the company’s financial condition in 

  

addition in arriving at these estimates we are required to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include a high degree of uncertainty the following is a discussion of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates related to these policies we have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

we have included sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions the sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear in addition the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

  

securitization transactions 

  

the company from time to time enters into securitization transactions that involve transfers of loans or other receivables to offbalancesheet qspes in most instances we provide the servicing on these loans as a condition of the sale in addition as part of these transactions the company may retain a cash reserve account an interestonly strip or in some cases a subordinated tranche all of which are considered to be retained interests in the securitized assets 

  

whenever we initiate a securitization the first determination that we must make in connection with the transaction is whether the transfer of the assets constitutes a sale under us generally accepted accounting principles if it does the assets are removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet with a gain or loss recognized otherwise the transfer is considered a financing resulting in no gain or loss being recognized and the recording of a liability on the company’s consolidated balance sheet the financing treatment could have unfavorable financial implications including an adverse effect on zions’ results of operations and capital ratios however all of the company’s securitizations have been structured to meet the existing criteria for sale treatment 

  

another determination that must be made is whether the specialpurpose entity involved in the securitization is independent from the company or whether it should be included in its consolidated financial statements if the entity’s activities meet certain criteria for it to be considered a qspe no consolidation is required since all of the company’s securitizations have been with entities that have met the requirements to be treated as qspes they have met the existing accounting criteria for nonconsolidation 

  

finally we must make assumptions to determine the amount of gain or loss resulting from the securitization transaction as well as the subsequent carrying amount for the retained interests in determining the gain or loss we use assumptions that are based on the facts surrounding each securitization using alternatives to these assumptions could affect the amount of gain or loss recognized on the transaction and in turn the company’s results of operations in valuing the retained interests since quoted market prices of these interests are generally not available we must estimate their value based on the present value of the future cash flows associated with the securitizations these value estimations require the company to make a number of assumptions including 

  

   

      

quarterly the company reviews its valuation assumptions for retained beneficial interests under the rules contained in emerging issues task force issue no 9920 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  “eitf 9920” these rules require the company to periodically update its assumptions used to compute estimated cash flows for its retained beneficial interests and compare the net present value of these cash flows to the carrying value the company complies with eitf 9920 by quarterly evaluating and updating its assumptions including the default assumption as compared to the historical credit losses and the credit loss expectation of the portfolio and its prepayment speed assumption as compared to the historical prepayment speeds and prepayment rate expectation changes in certain 2006 assumptions from 2005 for securizations were made in accordance with this process

allowance for loan losses 

  

the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios along with other relevant factors these evaluations are inherently subjective and require us to make numerous assumptions estimates and judgments 

  

in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type for commercial loans we use historical loss experience factors by loan segment adjusted for changes in trends and conditions to help determine an indicated allowance for each segment these factors are based on a migration analysis technique and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific portfolio segment the other considerations used in our analysis include volumes and trends of delinquencies levels of nonaccrual loans repossessions and bankruptcies trends in criticized and classified loans and expected losses on loans secured by real estate in addition new credit products and policies current economic conditions concentrations of credit risk and the experience and abilities of lending personnel are also taken into consideration 

  

in addition to the segment evaluations nonaccrual loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of 500 thousand or more are individually evaluated in accordance with sfas no 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan to determine the level of impairment and establish a specific reserve a specific allowance is established for loans adversely graded below 500 thousand when it is determined that the risk associated with the loan differs significantly from the risk factor amounts established for its loan segment 

  

for consumer loans we use a forecasting model based on internally generated portfolio delinquencies that employs “roll rates” to calculate losses “roll rates” are the rates at which accounts migrate from one delinquency level to the next higher level using average roll rates for the most recent twelvemonth period and comparing projected losses to actual loss experience the model estimates the expected losses in dollars for the forecasted period by refreshing it with updated data the model establishes projected losses for a new twelvemonth period each month segmenting the portfolio into nine product groupings with similar risk profiles 

  

as a final step to the evaluation process we perform an additional review of the adequacy of the allowance based on the loan portfolio in its entirety this enables us to mitigate the imprecision inherent in most estimates of expected credit losses this review of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any adjustments necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excessive concentration risks 

  

there are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses some are quantitative while others require us to make qualitative judgments although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address all of the components that could potentially result in credit losses the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of creditrelated events and our estimates and projections could require an additional provision for credit losses which would negatively impact the company’s results of operations in future periods as an example if a total of 250 million of nonclassified loans were to be immediately classified as special mention substandard and doubtful in the same proportion as the existing portfolio the amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2006 would increase by approximately 16 million in addition since the allowance for loan losses is assigned to the company’s business segments that have loan portfolios any earnings impact resulting from actual results differing from our estimates would have the largest impact on those segments with the largest loan portfolios namely zions bank cbt and amegy this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in the level of the criticized and classified loans may have on the allowance estimation process we believe that given the procedures that we follow in determining the potential losses in the loan portfolio the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate 

  

we are in the process of developing potential changes to enhance our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses the potential changes include incorporating a twofactor grading system to include probability of default and loss given default we currently anticipate that these changes will be phased in during 2007 and 2008 

  

nonmarketable equity securities 

  

the company either directly through its banking subsidiaries or through its small business investment companies “sbic” owns investments in venture funds and other capital securities that are not publicly traded and are not accounted for using the equity method since these nonmarketable securities have no readily ascertainable fair values they are reported at amounts that we have estimated to be their fair values in estimating the fair value of each investment we must apply judgment using certain assumptions initially we believe that an investment’s cost is the best indication of its fair value provided that there have been no significant positive or negative developments subsequent to its acquisition that indicate the necessity of an adjustment to a fair value estimate if and when such an event takes place we adjust the investment’s cost by an amount that we believe reflects the nature of the event in addition any minority interests in the company’s sbics reduce its share of any gains or losses incurred on these investments 

  

as of december 31 2006 the company’s total investment in nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for using the equity method was 1176 million of which its equity exposure to investments held by the sbics net of related minority interest of 412 million and sba debt of 70 million was 555 million in addition exposure to nonsbic equity investments not accounted for by the equity method was 139 million 

  

the values that we have assigned to these securities where no market quotations exist are based upon available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that ultimately will be realized on these securities key information used in valuing these securities include the projected financial performance of these companies the evaluation of the investee company’s management team and other industry economic and market factors if there had been an active market for these securities the carrying value may have been significantly different from the amounts reported in addition since zions bank and amegy are the principal business segments holding these investments they would experience the largest impact of any changes in the fair values of these securities 

  

accounting for goodwill 

  

goodwill arises from business acquisitions and represents the value attributable to the unidentifiable intangible elements in our acquired businesses goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs this annual test as of october 1 of each year evaluations are also performed on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place such events could include among others a significant adverse change in the business climate an adverse action by a regulator an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit 

  

the first step in this evaluation process is to determine if a potential impairment exists in any of the company’s reporting units and if required from the results of this step a second step measures the amount of any impairment loss the computations required by steps 1 and 2 call for us to make a number of estimates and assumptions in completing step 1 we determine the fair value of the reporting unit that is being evaluated in determining the fair value we generally calculate value using a combination of up to three separate methods comparable publicly traded financial service companies in the western and southwestern states comparable 

  

acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash or income flows critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include 

  

       

if step 1 indicates a potential impairment of a reporting unit step 2 requires us to estimate the “implied fair value” of the reporting unit this process estimates the fair value of the unit’s individual assets and liabilities in the same manner as if a purchase of the reporting unit were taking place to do this we must determine the fair value of the assets liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit based upon the best available information if the value of goodwill calculated in step 2 is less than the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit an impairment is indicated and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to the calculated value 

  

since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition changes in revenue growth trends cost structures and technology changes in discount rates changes in stock and mergers and acquisitions market values and changes in industry or market sector conditions 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2006 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation for the entire organization effective october 1 2006 step 1 was performed by using both market value and transaction value approaches for all reporting units and in certain cases the discounted cash flow approach was also used in the market value approach we identified a group of publicly traded banks that are similar in size and location to zions’ subsidiary banks and then used valuation multiples developed from the group to apply to our subsidiary banks in the transaction value approach we reviewed the purchase price paid in recent mergers and acquisitions of banks similar in size to zions’ subsidiary banks from these purchase prices we developed a set of valuation multiples which we applied to our subsidiary banks in instances where the discounted cash flow approach was used we discounted projected cash flows to their present value to arrive at our estimate of fair value 

  

upon completion of step 1 of the evaluation process we concluded that no potential impairment existed for any of the company’s reporting units in reaching this conclusion we determined that the fair values of goodwill exceeded the recorded values of goodwill since this evaluation process required us to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the company’s reporting units actual values may differ significantly from these estimates such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill 

  

that would in turn negatively impact the company’s results of operations and the business segments where the goodwill is recorded however had our estimated fair values been 10 lower there would still have been no indication of impairment for any of our reporting units 

  

accounting for derivatives 

  

our interest rate risk management strategy involves hedging the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so as to mitigate adverse effects on the company’s net interest margin and cash flows from changes in interest rates while we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading we consider it prudent to use certain derivative instruments to add stability to the company’s interest income and expense to modify the duration of specific assets and liabilities and to manage the company’s exposure to interest rate movements in addition the company has a program to provide derivative financial instruments to certain customers acting as an intermediary in the transaction upon issuance all of these customer derivatives are immediately “hedged” by offsetting derivative contracts such that the company has no net interest rate risk exposure resulting from the transaction 

  

all derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value as of december 31 2006 the recorded amounts of derivative assets classified in other assets and derivative liabilities classified in other liabilities were 517 million and 632 million respectively since there are no market value quotes for the specific derivative instruments that the company holds we must estimate their fair values generally this estimate is made by an independent third party using a standardized methodology that nets the discounted expected future cash receipts and cash payments based on observable market inputs these future net cash flows however are susceptible to change due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates as a result the estimated values of these derivatives will typically change over time as cash is received and paid and also as market conditions change as these changes take place they may have a positive or negative impact on our estimated valuations however based on the nature and limited purposes of the derivatives that the company employs fluctuations in interest rates have only a modest effect on its results of operations 

  

in addition to making the valuation estimates we also face the risk that certain derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges and currently meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  may not qualify in the future as “highly effective” as defined by the statement as well as the risk that hedged transactions in cash flow hedging relationships may no longer be considered probable to occur during 2006 no hedge ineffectiveness was required to be reported in earnings on the company’s cash flow hedging relationships further new interpretations and guidance related to sfas 133 continue to be issued and we cannot predict the possible impact that they will have on our use of derivative instruments in the future 

  

although the majority of the company’s hedging relationships have been designated as cash flow hedges for which hedge effectiveness is assessed and measured using a “long haul” approach the company also had five fair value hedging relationships outstanding as of december 31 2006 that were designated using the “shortcut” method as described in sfas 133 paragraph 68 the company believes that the shortcut method continues to be appropriate for those hedges because we have precisely complied with the documentation requirements and each of the applicable shortcut criteria described in paragraph 68 

  

pension accounting 

  

as explained in detail in note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that is available to employees who have met specific eligibility requirements also as explained in the note as of january 1 2003 no new employees are eligible to participate in the plan and future benefit accruals were eliminated for most participants 

  

in accounting for the plan we must determine the obligation associated with the plan benefits and compare that with the assets that the plan owns this requires us to incorporate numerous assumptions including the expected rate of return on plan assets the projected rate of increase of the salaries of the eligible employees and the discount rates to use in estimating the fair value of the liability the expected rate of return on plan assets is intended to approximate the longterm rate of return that we anticipate receiving on the plan’s investments considering the mix of the assets that the plan holds as investments the expected return of those underlying investments the diversification of those investments and the rebalancing strategy employed the projected rates of salary increases are management’s estimate of future pay increases that the remaining eligible employees will receive until their retirement the discount rate reflects the yields available on longterm highquality fixedincome debt instruments with cash flows similar to the obligations of the plan reset annually on the measurement date which is december 31 of each year 

  

the annual pension expense is sensitive to the expected rate of return on plan assets for example for the year 2006 the expected rate of return on plan assets was 850 for each 25 basis point change in this rate the company’s pension expense would change by approximately 300 thousand in applying the expected rate of return on plan assets to our pension accounting we base our calculations on the fair value of plan assets using an arithmetic method to calculate the expected return on the plan assets 

  

the annual pension expense is not significantly sensitive to the projected rate of increase of salaries of the eligible employees this is due to the limited number of employees who continue to actively accrue benefits within the plan 

  

the annual pension expense is also sensitive to the discount rate employed for example the discount rate used in the 2006 pension expense calculation was 560 if this rate were 25 basis points lower the pension expense would increase by approximately 280 thousand if the rate were 25 basis points higher the pension expense would decrease by approximately 270 thousand 

  

in estimating the annual pension expense and funded status associated with the defined benefit plan we must make a number of assumptions and estimates based upon our judgment and also on information that we receive from an independent actuary these assumptions and estimates are closely monitored and are reviewed at least annually for any adjustments that may be required 

  

in addition we assumed obligations of a defined benefit plan when we acquired amegy that plan resulted from a previous acquisition by amegy the plan is also frozen and we are in the process of terminating it the planned termination was considered in remeasuring the acquired plan projected benefit obligation at the date of the amegy acquisition the acquired plan projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by 21 million and was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

as discussed in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment  which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values sfas 123r utilizes a “modified grantdate” approach in which the fair value of an equity award is estimated on the grant date without regard to service or performance vesting conditions while under prior guidance we elected not to expense sharebased compensation we have disclosed in note 17 the pro forma effect on net income as if our sharebased compensation had been expensed 

  

we adopted sfas 123r using the “modified prospective” transition method under this transition method compensation expense is recognized beginning january 1 2006 based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after december 31 2005 and based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to january 1 2006 that remain unvested as of that date results of operations for prior years have not been restated 

  

the company has used the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the value of stock options and the pro forma expense for sharebased compensation the assumptions used to apply this model include a weighted average riskfree interest rate a weighted average expected life an expected dividend yield and an expected volatility use of these assumptions is subjective and requires judgment as described in note 17 

  

the most significant assumptions impacted by management’s judgment are the weighted average expected life and the expected volatility the company performed a sensitivity analysis of the impact of increasing and decreasing expected volatility 10 as well as the impact of increasing and decreasing the weighted average expected life by one year the company performed this analysis on the stock options granted in 2006 the following table shows the impact of these changes on the company’s stock option expense for the options granted in 2006

the adoption of sfas 123r decreased income before income taxes by 175 million and net income by approximately 126 million for 2006 or 012 per diluted share see note 17 for additional information on stock options and restricted stock 

  

income taxes 

  

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and other jurisdictions where it conducts business these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws related regulations and case law in the process of preparing the company’s tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 

  

on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a quarterly basis if business events or circumstances warrant reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits the company has tax reserves at december 31 2006 of approximately 39 million for uncertain tax positions primarily for various state tax contingencies in several jurisdictions 

  

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  under the guidance of fin 48 management estimates that these reserves may decrease by approximately 9 million to 13 million which is subject to revision when management completes an analysis of the impact of fin 48 as required by fin 48 upon adoption on january 1 2007 this difference will be recorded in retained earnings as a cumulative effect adjustment see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes 

  

results of operations 

  

as previously disclosed the company completed its acquisition of amegy bancorporation inc in december 2005 all comparisons of 2006 to 2005 and prior periods reflect the effects of the amegy acquisition 

  

net interest income margin and interest rate spreads 

  

net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income is the largest component of zions’ revenue for the year 2006 it was 764 of our taxableequivalent revenues compared to 760 for 2005 and 733 in 2004 on a taxableequivalent basis net interest income for 2006 was up 4066 million or 294 from 2005 which was up 2003 million or 169 from 2004 the increase in taxableequivalent net interest income for 2006 was driven by the significant increase in both earning assets and core deposits resulting from the amegy acquisition strong organic loan growth and the impact of increasing shortterm interest rates on zions’ assetsensitive balance sheet which resulted in a 5 basis point increase in the net interest margin compared to 2005 the net interest margin for 2005 was up 31 basis points from 2004 the incremental tax rate used for calculating all taxableequivalent adjustments was 35 for all years discussed and presented 

  

by its nature net interest income is especially vulnerable to changes in the mix and amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in the interest rates and yields associated with these assets and liabilities significantly impact net interest income see “interest rate and market risk management” on page 86 for a complete discussion of how we manage the portfolios of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and associated risk 

  

a gauge that we consistently use to measure the company’s success in managing its net interest income is the level and stability of the net interest margin the net interest margin was 463 in 2006 compared with 458 in 2005 and 427 in 2004 the slightly increased margin for 2006 results mainly from an improved earning asset mix and from the impact of increasing shortterm interest rates on zions’ assetsensitive balance sheet in addition we significantly improved amegy’s preacquisition earning asset mix and net interest margin by applying zions interest rate risk management strategies higher yielding average loans and leases increased 84 billion from 2005 while lower yielding average money market investments and securities increased 128 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 the company’s net interest margin was 460 however the company’s funding mix actually shifted in an unfavorable direction in 2006 as core deposit growth slowed and earning asset growth was funded from more expensive sources for example average noninterestbearing deposits were 298 of total average deposits for 2005 compared to 290 for 2006 over the same period average time deposits greater than 100000 increased from 69 to 100 of total average deposits 

  

the increased margin for 2005 compared to 2004 resulted mainly from an improved asset and liability mix and from the impact of increasing shortterm interest rates on zions’ assetsensitive balance sheet higher yielding average loans and leases increased 30 billion from 2004 while lower yielding average money market investments and securities decreased 05 billion the net increase in interestearnings assets was mainly funded by increases in lower cost average interestbearing deposits which increased 16 billion and average noninterestbearing deposits which increased 11 billion while average borrowed funds decreased 05 billion from 2004 

  

the company expects to continue its efforts to maintain a slightly “assetsensitive” position with regard to interest rate risk however our estimates of the company’s actual position are highly dependent upon changes in both shortterm and longterm interest rates modeling assumptions and the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes 

  

schedule 6 summarizes the average balances the amount of interest earned or incurred and the applicable yields for interestearning assets and the costs of interestbearing liabilities that generate taxableequivalent net interest income 

  

schedule 6 

  

distribution of assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity 

average balance sheets yields and rates 

  

   

    

  

   

schedule 7 analyzes the yeartoyear changes in net interest income on a fully taxableequivalent basis for the years indicated for purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans however interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions in addition interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates 

  

schedule 7 

  

analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate 

  

   

    

in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate changes due to the volumerate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions when volume and rate both increase the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate when the rate increases and volume decreases the variance is allocated to the rate 

  

provisions for credit losses 

  

the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that based on our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level the provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the allowance for unfunded lending commitments at an adequate level in determining adequate levels of the allowances we perform periodic evaluations of the company’s various portfolios the levels of actual chargeoffs and statistical trends and other economic factors see “credit risk management” on page 77 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded lending commitments 

  

for the year 2006 the provision for loan losses was 726 million compared to 430 million for 2005 and 441 million for 2004 net loan and lease chargeoffs increased from 25 million in 2005 to 46 million in 2006 both the increased net chargeoffs and provisions reflect the company’s increased size after the amegy acquisition in addition the higher provision for 2006 reflects the increased provisioning resulting from 45 billion of loan growth in 2006 in the fourth quarter we incurred a loss on an equipment lease related to an alleged accounting fraud at a water bottling company our nba affiliate had a 171 million participation in this lease we recorded a chargeoff of approximately 109 million during the fourth quarter related to this lease 

  

the lower provisions for both 2005 and 2004 reflect improvements in various credit quality factors used in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses including decreased levels of criticized and classified loans including the provision for unfunded lending commitments the total provision for credit losses was 738 million for 2006 464 million for 2005 and 445 million for 2004 from period to period the amounts of unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizeable fluctuation due to changes in the timing and volume of loan originations and associated funding

service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased significantly in 2006 and declined moderately in 2005 the increase for 2006 was mainly as a result of the acquisition of amegy however deposit service charges and fees increased in each quarter of 2006 reflecting the company’s efforts to promote treasury management services to its customers including netdeposit remote deposit capture services the 2005 decrease was mainly caused by higher earnings credits on commercial deposit accounts as market interest rates rose 

  

loan sales and servicing income includes revenues from securitizations of loans as well as from revenues that we earn through servicing loans that have been sold to third parties for 2006 loan sales and servicing income decreased 303 compared to 2005 the decrease was due to no small business loan securitization sale transactions in 2006 lower servicing fees from lower loan balances and 71 million in retained interest write downs these write downs resulted primarily from higher than expected loan prepayments and changes in the interest rate environment as determined from our periodic evaluation of beneficial interests as required by eitf 9920 for 2005 loan sales and servicing income decreased 16 compared to 2004 the decrease was mainly due to decreased gains from the sale of conforming residential loans sold servicing released and from the sale of home equity credit lines see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company’s securitization programs 

  

other service charges commissions and fees which is comprised of fiscal agent fees automated teller machine “atm” fees insurance commissions bankcard merchant fees debit card interchange fees and other miscellaneous fees increased 555 million or 499 from 2005 which was up 189 from 2004 the 2006 increase was primarily due to the amegy acquisition the increase for 2005 included 37 million of fees earned by amegy other significant increases for 2005 included increases in debit card interchange fees resulting from increased volumes increased letter of credit fees and customer swap fees and increased fees from the company’s municipal finance business

income from securities conduit represents fees that we receive from lockhart a qspe securities conduit in return for liquidity management an interest rate agreement and administrative services that zions bank provides to the entity in accordance with a servicing agreement the 80 decrease in income for 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from lower servicing fees on the investment holdings in lockhart’s securities portfolio see “liquidity management actions” on page 93 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding securitizations and lockhart 

  

dividends and other investment income consist of revenue from the company’s bankowned life insurance program dividends on securities holdings and equity in earnings from other investments revenue from bankowned life insurance programs was 266 million in 2006 189 million in 2005 and 185 million in 2004 the increase for 2006 is due to amegy revenues from investments include dividends on federal home loan bank “fhlb” federal reserve bank stock and equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates and were 133 million in 2006 111 million in 2005 and 133 million in 2004

net equity securities gains in 2006 were 178 million as compared to net losses of 13 million in 2005 and 98 million in 2004 the increase was primarily due to 197 million of net gains on venture capital investments recognized in 2006 net of related minority interest of 100 million income taxes and other expenses venture capital investments contributed 41 million to net income in 2006 compared to losses of 22 million for 2005 and 45 million for 2004

national bank of arizona 

  

nba the company’s financial institution responsible for operations in arizona is the fourth largest fullservice commercial bank in arizona measured by deposits booked in the state nba’s branch network is presently located in 36 communities spanning the entire state arizona’s population growth continues to be one the strongest in the entire country and the state is currently ranked the 16 th largest in the nation by population population in the state exceeds 62 million residents the phoenix and tucson metropolitan areas together comprise over 80 of the state’s population – over 5 million people the arizona job market remains robust and among the leaders in the nation with annual growth nearing the 5 mark in 2006 which followed a year in which the growth exceeded this level 

  

housing has fueled a large portion of the arizona economy for a number of years the housing market did experience a 23 decline in 2006 as related to residential building permits yet this followed a number of years with double digit increases despite the slowdown in the residential housing market residential building permits were 66062 for 2006 compared to 85835 in 2005 and 87834 in 2004 the commercial real estate activity was not affected by the softening of the residential activity as vacancy rates declined and per square foot rental rates increased in the metropolitan marketplaces nba is a recognized leader in real estate lending in arizona 

  

the continued strength of the arizona economy coupled with the consistent growth in the balance sheet of nba produced another record breaking year in terms of financial performance and growth for the organization with the exception of housing starts home prices and the rate of existing home sales most drivers of the arizona economy are expected to remain strong for 2007 thus the arizona economy is expected to grow in 2007 but more moderately than in the prior two years

nba’s net income in 2006 rose by 144 to 732 million following a 410 growth in earnings in 2005 net interest income increased by 146 compared to 2005 this increase in the net interest income is directly attributable to the growth in earning assets coupled with consistent strength in the net interest margin the net interest margin declined only slightly to 520 in 2006 compared to 523 in 2005 the compression primarily reflects the increased reliance on noncore deposit funding to support continued loan growth funding costs for core deposits grew at a slightly slower pace than the increase in yields on earning assets 

  

noninterest income increased 181 in 2006 compared to 2005 which in turn was essentially flat compared to 2004 the noninterest income increases were primarily impacted by increases in business and personal credit and debit card activity favorable changes in service charge rates and gains in venture fund investments despite the slowdown experienced in the residential real estate market fees charged for residential development and construction lending remained flat compared to 2005 

  

noninterest expense increased at a moderate pace of 53 over 2005 to 1030 million yielding positive operating leverage for 2006 commensurate with the expanding opportunities and revenue growth in the retail and commercial banking areas nba expanded its work force to take advantage of these opportunities increased compensation costs related to these additional employees comprised the largest component of the noninterest expense increases overall nba’s efficiency ratio improved nearly 4 in 2006 to 428 compared to 467 for 2005

noninterest expense increased by 43 compared to 2005 which was up 102 from 2004 salaries and benefits were the leading component of the increase in 2006 driven by the opening of new offices and expansion of lending departments salaries were also the primary cause of the increase in 2005 nsb’s efficiency ratio was 484 for 2006 524 for 2005 and 549 for 2004 the bank continues to focus on managing operating costs to improve its efficiency

the amortized cost of investment securities at yearend 2006 decreased 230 million from 2005 the decrease was mainly the result of an increase in maturing securities in 2006 and pay downs of mortgagebacked securities 

  

schedule 28 also presents information regarding the investment securities portfolio this schedule presents the maturities of the different types of investments that the company owned as of december 31 2006 and the corresponding average interest rates that the investments will yield if they are held to maturity it should be noted that most of the sba loanbacked securities and mortgageassetbacked securities are variable rate and their repricing periods are significantly less than their contractual maturities also see “liquidity risk” on page 91 and notes 1 4 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s investment securities and their management

in addition to the nonrated municipal securities the portfolio includes nonrated assetbacked subordinated tranches the assetbacked subordinated tranches created from the company’s loans are mainly the subordinated retained interests of small business loan securitizations the senior tranches of these securitizations are sold to lockhart a qspe securities conduit described further in “offbalancesheet arrangements” on page 76 at december 31 2006 these comprised 194 million of the 214 million set forth in schedule 31 the tranches not created from the company’s loans are tranches of bank and insurance company trust preferred 

  

collateral debt obligations investment securities also include other nonrated debt securities the majority of which were created by zions bank although the credit quality of these nonrated securities generally is high it would be difficult to market them in a short period of time since they are not rated and there is no active trading market for them 

  

loan portfolio 

  

as of december 31 2006 net loans and leases accounted for 738 of total assets and 772 of tangible assets as compared to 704 of total assets and 740 of tangible assets at december 31 2005 schedule 30 presents the company’s loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent yearends the schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2006 however while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans in certain cases the company has hedged the repricing characteristics of its variablerate loans as more fully described in “interest rate risk” on page 87

note during 2006 the company reclassified certain balances between construction and land development home equity credit line and other consumer real estate and 14 family residential information to reclassify the loans for years prior to 2005 is not available 

  

loan growth was strong in most of the banking subsidiaries during 2006 particularly zions bank and amegy as previously discussed in “business segment results” beginning on page 52 we expect that loan growth will continue in 2007 in most of our subsidiary banks however the rate of growth began to slow during the second half of 2006 and even turned negative in cbt and nsb in the fourth quarter the average growth experienced in 2006 may not be sustainable throughout 2007

the company receives a fee for performing loan servicing for third parties failure by the company to service the loans in accordance with the contractual requirements of the servicing agreements may lead to the termination of the servicing contract and the loss of future servicing fees 

  

schedule 31 

  

sold loans being serviced 

  

   

the company has securitized and sold a portion of the loans that it originated and purchased in many instances we agreed to provide the servicing on these loans as a condition of the sale schedule 31 summarizes the sold loans other than conforming longterm first mortgage real estate loans that the company was servicing as of the dates indicated and the related loan sales activity as reflected in the schedule sales for 2006 decreased approximately 10 billion compared to 2005 the company did not complete a small business loans securitization during 2006 and also discontinued selling new home equity credit lines originations during the fourth quarter small business consumer and other sold loans being serviced totaled 26 billion at the end of 2006 compared to 34 billion at the end of 2005 see notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on asset securitizations in addition at december 31 2006 conforming longterm first mortgage real estate loans being serviced for others was 1251 million compared with 1274 million at the same date in 2005 

  

although it performs the servicing the company exerts no control nor does it have any equity interest in any of the trusts that own the securitized loans however as of december 31 2006 the company had recorded assets in the amount of 312 million in connection with sold loans being serviced of 26 billion as is a common practice with securitized transactions the company had subordinated retained interests in the securitized assets amounting to 222 million at december 31 2006 representing junior positions to the other investors in the trust securities the capitalized residual cash flows which is sometimes referred to as “excess servicing” of 90 million primarily represent the present value of the excess cash flows that have been projected over the lives of the sold loans these excess cash flows are subject to prepayment risk which is the risk that a loan will be paid prior to its contractual maturity when this occurs any remaining excess cash flows that are associated with the loan must be reduced see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on asset securitizations 

  

other earning assets 

  

as of december 31 2006 the company had 1022 million of other noninterestbearing investments compared with 939 million in 2005 the increase in other noninterestbearing investments resulted mainly from regulatory required increases in federal reserve stock at amegy and increases in the sbic and bankowned life insurance investments

offbalancesheet arrangements 

  

zions bank provides a liquidity facility for a fee to a qspe securities conduit lockhart which purchases us government and aaarated securities which are funded through the issuance of its commercial paper at december 31 2006 approximately 38 of the aaarated securities held by lockhart were created by the company’s securitization of small business loans as previously discussed zions bank also receives a fee in exchange for providing hedge support and administrative and investment advisory services under the terms of the liquidity facility if certain conditions arise zions bank is required to purchase securities from lockhart to provide funds and enable it to repay maturing commercial paper lockhart has been an important source of funding for the company’s loans and is not consolidated in the company’s financial statements see “liquidity management actions” on page 93 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on lockhart 

  

  

risk elements 

  

since risk is inherent in substantially all of the company’s operations management of risk is integral to those operations and is also a key determinant of the company’s overall performance we apply various strategies to reduce the risks to which the company’s operations are exposed including credit interest rate and market liquidity and operational risks 

  

credit risk management 

  

credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower or contractual counterparty to fully perform under the terms of a creditrelated contract credit risk arises primarily from the company’s lending activities as well as from other on and offbalancesheet credit instruments 

  

effective management of credit risk is essential in maintaining a safe sound and profitable financial institution we have structured the organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function which has added strength to the control over and independent evaluation of credit activities formal loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions in addition the company has a welldefined set of standards for evaluating its loan portfolio and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio further an independent internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the company’s lending departments these examinations are designed to review credit quality adequacy of documentation appropriate loan grading administration and compliance with lending policies and reports thereon are submitted to the credit review committee of the board of directors 

  

both the credit policy and the credit examination functions are managed centrally each bank is able to modify corporate credit policy to be more conservative however corporate approval must be obtained if a bank wishes to create a more liberal exception to the policy historically only a limited number of such exceptions have been approved this entire process has been designed to place an emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed and implemented on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses 

  

with regard to credit risk associated with counterparties in offbalancesheet credit instruments zions bank has international swap dealer association “isda” agreements in place under which derivative transactions are entered into with major derivative dealers each isda agreement details the collateral arrangement between zions bank and its counterparty in every case the amount of the collateral required to secure the exposed party in the derivative transaction is determined by the marktomarket exposure on the derivative and the credit rating of the party with the obligation the credit rating used in these situations is provided by either moody’s or standard  poor’s this means that a counterparty with an “aaa” rating would be obligated to provide less collateral to secure a major credit exposure to zions bank than one with an “a” rating all derivative gains and losses between zions bank and a single counterparty are netted to determine the net credit exposure and therefore the collateral required 

  

  

another aspect of the company’s credit risk management strategy is to pursue the diversification of the loan portfolio the company maintains a diversified loan portfolio with some emphasis in real estate as displayed in schedule 34 at yearend 2006 no single loan type exceeded 242 of the company’s total loan portfolio 

  

schedule 34 

  

loan portfolio diversification 

  

   

in addition as reflected in schedule 35 as of december 31 2006 the commercial real estate loan portfolio totaling 124 billion is also well diversified by property type and collateral location 

  

schedule 35 

  

commercial real estate portfolio by property type and collateral location 

represents percentages based upon outstanding commercial real estate loans 

at december 31 2006 

  

   

   

note excludes approximately 537 million of unsecured loans outstanding but related to the real estate industry 

  

loantovalue “ltv” ratios are another key determinant of credit risk in commercial real estate lending the company estimates that the weighted average ltv ratio on the total commercial real estate portfolio at june 30 2006 detailed in schedule 35 was approximately 586 this estimate is based on the most current appraisals generally obtained as of the date of origination or renewal of the loans 

  

we believe the company’s potential risk from concentration in owner occupied commercial loans is reduced by the emphasis we place on lending programs sponsored by the sba on these types of loans the sba bears a major portion of the credit risk in addition the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular industry trade 

  

group or property type the company also has no significant exposure to highlyleveraged transactions and the majority of the company’s business activity is with customers within the geographical footprint of its banking subsidiaries finally the company has no significant exposure to any individual customer or counterparty see “credit risk management” on page 77 for a discussion of counterparty risk associated with the company’s derivative transactions see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on concentrations of credit risk 

  

nonperforming assets 

  

nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans restructured loans and other real estate owned at december 31 2006 nonperforming assets also included 62 million of equipment related to the participation in an equipment lease by nba as previously discussed loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection consumer loans are not normally placed on a nonaccrual status inasmuch as they are generally charged off when they become 120 days past due loans also occasionally may be restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments this generally occurs when the financial condition of a borrower deteriorates to the point where the borrower needs to be given temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan other real estate owned is acquired primarily through or in lieu of foreclosure on loans secured by real estate 

  

the company’s nonperforming assets as a percentage of net loans and leases and other real estate owned continued to improve during 2006 the percentage was 024 at december 31 2006 compared with 030 on december 31 2005 total nonperforming assets were 82 million at yearend 2006 compared to 89 million at december 31 2005 and 84 million at december 31 2004 internal loan classification measures also have continued to reflect strong credit quality during 2006 

  

schedule 36 

  

nonperforming assets 

  

   

   

included in nonaccrual loans are loans that we have determined to be impaired loans other than those included in large groups of smallerbalance homogeneous loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement including scheduled interest payments the amount of the impairment is measured based on either the present value of expected cash flows the observable market value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan 

  

the company’s total recorded investment in impaired loans was 47 million at december 31 2006 and 31 million at december 31 2005 estimated losses on impaired loans are included in the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2006 the allowance included 6 million for impaired loans with a recorded investment of 18 million at december 31 2005 the allowance 

  

for loan losses included 3 million for impaired loans with a recorded investment of 14 million see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on impaired loans 

  

allowances for credit losses 

  

allowance for loan losses  in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses we utilize a comprehensive loan grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio and also consider the results of independent internal credit reviews to determine the adequacy of the allowance the company’s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 

  

for commercial loans we use historical loss experience factors by loan segment adjusted for changes in trends and conditions to help determine an indicated allowance for each portfolio segment these factors are based on a migration analysis technique and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific segment these other considerations include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to the segment evaluations nonaccrual loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of 500 thousand or more are individually evaluated in accordance with sfas no 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan to determine the level of impairment and establish a specific reserve a specific allowance is established for loans adversely graded below 500 thousand when it is determined that the risk associated with the loan differs significantly from the risk factor amounts established for its loan segment 

  

the allowance for consumer loans is determined using historically developed experience rates at which loans migrate from one delinquency level to the next higher level using average roll rates for the most recent twelvemonth period and comparing projected losses to actual loss experience the model estimates expected losses in dollars for the forecasted period by refreshing the model with updated data it is able to project losses for a new twelvemonth period each month segmenting the portfolio into nine product groupings with similar risk profiles this methodology is an accepted industry practice and the company believes it has a sufficient volume of information to produce reliable projections 

  

as a final step to the evaluation process we perform an additional review of the adequacy of the allowance based on the loan portfolio in its entirety this enables us to mitigate the imprecision inherent in most estimates of expected credit losses this review of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any adjustments necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excessive concentration risks 

  

the methodology used by amegy to estimate its allowance for loan losses has not yet been conformed to the process used by the other affiliate banks however the process used by amegy is not significantly different than the process used by our other affiliate banks 

  

the company has initiated a comprehensive review of its allowance for loan losses methodology with a view toward updating and conforming this methodology across all of its banking subsidiaries the company expects to begin implementing this updated methodology in 2007 and to complete the implementation in 2008 

  

schedule 37 summarizes the company’s loan loss experience by major portfolio segment

schedule 38 provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation among the portfolio segments no significant changes took place in the past four years in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment 

  

schedule 38 

  

allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

at december 31 

  

    

as reflected in schedule 38 the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2006 increased by 27 million from yearend 2005 for 2006 the amount of the allowance allocated for criticized and classified commercial loans increased 31 million compared to 02 million for 2005 the level of the allowance for noncriticized and classified commercial loans increased 24 million for 2006 compared to an increase of 23 million for 2005 the increase in level of the allowance indicated for noncriticized and classified loans for both 2006 and 2005 was mainly a result of 45 billion of new commercial and commercial real estate loan growth during 2006 and 75 billion of growth during 2005 including 52 billion of acquired amegy loans at december 31 2006 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases outstanding decreased to 105 compared to 112 at december 31 2005 this decrease reflects improved trends in both historical loss experience and nonaccrual loans as previously discussed 

  

the increased allowance for loan losses at december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 included a 49 million amegy allowance acquired in addition to the changes above excluding amegy the allowance for consumer loans at yearend 2005 decreased 5 million compared to 2004 mainly due to a decrease in outstanding consumer loans primarily as a result of a decision to exit indirect auto lending 

  

allowance for unfunded lending commitments  the company also estimates an allowance for potential losses associated with offbalancesheet commitments and standby letters of credit prior to december 31 2003 this allowance was included in the overall allowance for loan losses it is now included with other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet with any related increases or decreases in the allowance included in noninterest expense in the statement of income 

  

we determine the allowance for unfunded lending commitments using a process that is similar to the one we use for commercial loans based on historical experience we have developed experiencebased loss factors that we apply to the company’s unfunded lending commitments to estimate the potential for loss in that portfolio these factors are generated from tracking commitments that become funded and develop into problem loans

interest rate and market risk management 

  

interest rate risk is the potential for loss resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates on the company’s net interest income market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the company is exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk 

  

the company’s board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the company the boards of directors of the company’s subsidiary banks are also required to review and approve these policies in addition the board must understand the key strategies set by management for managing risk establish and periodically revise policy limits and review reported limit exceptions the board has established the assetliability committee “alco” to which it has delegated the functional management of interest rate and market risk for the company alco’s primary responsibilities include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which the company is regularly exposed in general our goal in managing interest rate risk is to have the net interest margin increase slightly in a rising interest rate environment we refer to this goal as being slightly “assetsensitive” this approach is based on our belief that in a rising interest rate environment the market cost of equity or implied rate at which future earnings are discounted would also tend to rise 

  

we monitor this risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods duration of equity and income simulation in the duration of equity method we measure the expected changes in the market values of equity in response to changes in interest rates in the income simulation method we analyze the expected changes in income in response to changes in interest rates 

  

duration of equity is derived by first calculating the dollar duration of all assets liabilities and derivative instruments dollar duration is determined by calculating the market value of each instrument assuming interest rates sustain immediate and parallel movements up 1 and down 1 the average of these two changes in market value is the dollar duration subtracting the dollar duration of liabilities from the dollar duration of assets and adding the net dollar duration of derivative instruments results in the dollar duration of equity duration of equity is computed by dividing the dollar duration of equity by the market value of equity 

  

income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments net interest income is measured under several parallel and nonparallel interest rate environments and deposit repricing assumptions taking into account an estimate of the possible exercise of options within the portfolio 

  

both of these measurement methods require that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates the assessments address loan and security prepayments early deposit withdrawals and other embedded options and noncontrollable events as a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans the company estimates ranges of duration and income simulation under a variety of assumptions and scenarios the company’s interest rate risk position changes as the interest rate environment changes and is managed actively to try to maintain a consistent slightly assetsensitive position however positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company’s position in any subsequent period 

  

we should note that duration of equity is highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities such as checking savings and money market accounts and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options given the uncertainty of these durations we view the duration of equity as falling within a range of possibilities 

  

for income simulation company policy requires that interest sensitive income from a static balance sheet is expected to decline by no more than 10 during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 basis points 

  

as of the dates indicated schedule 41 shows the company’s estimated range of duration of equity duration of equity simulation and percentage change in interest sensitive income in the first year after the rate change if interest rates were to sustain an immediate parallel change of 200 basis points the “low” and “high” results differ based on the assumed speed of repricing of administeredrate deposits money market interestonchecking and savings 

  

schedule 41 

  

duration of equity and interest sensitive income 

  

   

we attempt to minimize the negative impact changes in interest rates will have on net interest income primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and by avoiding large exposures to fixed rate interestearning assets that have significant negative convexity the prime lending rate and the london interbank offer rate “libor” curves are the primary indices used for pricing the company’s loans the interest rates paid on deposit accounts are set by individual banks so as to be competitive in each local market 

  

our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the company’s assetliability management posture at the end of 2006 approximately 75 of the company’s commercial loan and commercial real estate portfolios were floating rate and tied to either prime or libor in addition certain of our consumer loans also have floating interest rates this means that these loans reprice quickly in response to changes in interest rates – more quickly on average than does their funding base this posture results in a naturally “assetsensitive” position 

  

it is our belief that the company’s core banking business leads naturally to a position that is more assetsensitive than is desirable the company attempts to mitigate this tendency toward asset sensitivity primarily through the use of interest rate swaps we have contracted to convert most of the company’s fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt through the use of interest rate swaps see fair value hedges in schedule 42 more importantly we engage in an ongoing program of swapping primebased and liborbased loans and other variablerate assets for “receive fixed” contracts at yearend 2006 the company had a notional amount of approximately 33 billion of such cash flow hedge contracts the company expects to continue to add new “receive fixed” swap contracts as its primebased loan portfolio grows these swaps also expose the company to counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk the company’s approach to managing this risk is discussed in “credit risk management” on page 77

market risk – fixed income 

  

the company engages in trading and market making of us treasury us government agency municipal and corporate securities this trading and market making exposes the company to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities held by the company 

  

during the last quarter of 2005 the company closed its london trading office and substantially reduced the size of its trading assets in response to continued narrow margins in its oddlot electronic bond trading business at december 31 2006 trading account assets had been reduced to 634 million and securities sold not yet purchased were 504 million 

  

at yearend 2006 the company made a market in 823 fixed income securities through zions bank and its whollyowned subsidiary zions direct inc during 2006 74 of all trades were executed electronically the company is an oddlot securities dealer which means that most us treasury and government agency trades are for less than 5 million and most corporate security trades are for less than 250000 

  

subsequent to yearend the company transferred the fixed income us treasury and government agency portion of this business to diawa securities 

  

the company monitors risk in fixed income trading and market making through valueatrisk “var” var is the worstcase loss expected within a specified confidence level based on statistical models using historical data valueatrisk information is not disclosed due to the limited risk in fixed income trading and market making after the reductions in the scale of the company’s trading operations 

  

market risk – equity investments 

  

through its equity investment activities the company owns equity securities that are publicly traded and subject to fluctuations in their market prices or values in addition the company owns equity securities in companies that are not publicly traded that are accounted for under cost fair value equity or full consolidation methods of accounting depending upon the company’s ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs in any case the value of the company’s investment is subject to fluctuation since these market prices or values may fall below the company’s investment costs the company is exposed to the possibility of loss these equity investments are approved monitored and evaluated by the company’s equity investment committee 

  

the company generally conducts minority investing in prepublic venture capital companies in which it does not have strategic involvement through four funds collectively referred to as wasatch venture funds “wasatch” wasatch screens investment opportunities and makes investment decisions based on its assessment of business prospects and potential returns after an investment is made wasatch actively monitors the performance of the companies in which it has invested and often has representation on the board of directors of the company net of expenses income tax effects and minority interest gains were 41 million in 2006 and losses were 22 million in 2005 and 45 million in 2004 the company’s remaining equity exposure to investments held by wasatch net of related minority interest and sba debt at december 31 2006 was approximately 491 million compared to approximately 409 million at december 31 2005 

  

in addition to the program described above amegy has in place an alternative investments program these investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies early stage venture capital funds generally are not part of the strategy since the underlying companies are typically not credit worthy the carrying value of the investments at december 31 2006 was 196 million as compared to 237 million at december 31 2005 the company has a total remaining funding commitment of 1029 million to sbic nonsbic hedge fund and private equity investments as of december 31 2006 this funding commitment is primarily at amegy totaling 935 million 

  

the company also from time to time either starts and funds businesses of a strategic nature or makes significant investments in companies of strategic interest these investments may result in either minority or majority ownership positions and usually give the parent or its subsidiaries board representation these strategic investments are in companies that are financial services or financial technologies providers examples of these investments include icap plc and lending tree which were both sold at substantial gains in 2003 other examples include contango netdeposit and p5 all of which are majority or whollyowned by the company and insurecom identrust and roth capital in which the company owns a significant but minority position 

  

liquidity risk 

  

overview 

liquidity risk is the possibility that the company’s cash flows may not be adequate to fund its ongoing operations and meet its commitments in a timely and costeffective manner since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk we manage the company’s liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet its anticipated financial and contractual obligations including withdrawals by depositors debt service requirements and lease obligations as well as to fund customers’ needs for credit 

  

overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of alco which implements a boardadopted corporate liquidity and funding policy that is adhered to by the parent and the subsidiary banks this policy includes guidelines by which liquidity and funding are managed these guidelines address maintaining liquidity needs diversifying funding positions monitoring liquidity at consolidated as well as subsidiary levels and anticipating future funding needs the policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the parent and bank subsidiaries 

  

managing liquidity and funding is performed centrally by zions bank’s capital marketsinvestment division under the direction of the company’s chief investment officer with oversight by alco the chief investment officer is responsible for making any 

  

recommended changes to existing funding plans as well as to the policy guidelines these recommendations must be submitted for approval to alco and potentially to the company’s board of directors the subsidiary banks only have authority to price deposits borrow from their fhlb and sellpurchase federal funds tofrom zions bank the banks may also make liquidity and funding recommendations to the chief investment officer but are not involved in any other funding decision processes 

  

contractual obligations 

  

schedule 43 summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2006 

  

schedule 43 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

      

as of december 31 2006 there were no minimum required pension plan contributions and no discretionary or noncash contributions are currently planned as a result no amounts have been included in the schedule above for future pension plan contributions during 2006 the company made a 10 million contribution to the plan based on actuarial recommendation 

  

in addition to the commitments specifically noted in the previous schedule the company enters into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business these include software licensing and maintenance telecommunications services facilities maintenance and equipment servicing supplies purchasing and other goods and services used in the operation of our business generally these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions the company has committed to contracts that may extend to several years 

  

the company also enters into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive cash or pay cash depending on changes in interest rates these contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the balance sheet date the fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change for further information on derivative contracts see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

pension obligations 

  

as of december 31 2006 the market value of the company’s pension plan assets was 1413 million and the benefit obligation as of that date was 1551 million as measured with an annual discount rate of 565 this means that the pension plan is underfunded in the amount of 138 million this underfunding is recorded as a liability on the company’s balance sheet since no new employees can be added to the plan and future benefit accruals were eliminated for most participants effective january 1 2003 this unfunded condition should decrease over time as the market value of plan assets is expected to appreciate faster than the benefit obligation although fluctuations in plan asset values could cause the unfunded amount to either increase or decrease over shorter time periods as a result the company does not anticipate a need to make any cash contributions to the plan in the near future however certain changes to federal laws and regulations governing defined benefit plans could change the company’s need to make future cash contributions 

  

liquidity management actions 

  

the parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service investment in and advances to subsidiaries operating expenses income taxes dividends to shareholders and share repurchases the parent’s cash needs are routinely met through dividends from its subsidiaries investment income subsidiaries’ proportionate share of current income taxes management and other fees bank lines equity contributed through the exercise of stock options commercial paper and longterm debt and equity issuances the subsidiaries’ primary source of funding is their core deposits operational cash flows while constituting a funding source for the company are not large enough to provide funding in the amounts that fulfill the needs of the parent and the bank subsidiaries for 2006 operations contributed 10 billion toward these needs as a result the company utilizes other sources at its disposal to manage its liquidity needs 

  

during 2006 the parent received 4316 million in dividends from various subsidiaries at december 31 2006 the banking subsidiaries could pay 4038 million of dividends to the parent under regulatory guidelines without the need for regulatory approval the amounts of dividends the banking subsidiaries can pay the parent are restricted by earnings and riskbased capital requirements the dividend capacity is dependent on the continued profitability of the subsidiary banks and no significant changes in the current regulatory environment while we have no current expectation that these two conditions will change should a change take place to either in the future this source of funding to the parent may become more limited or even unavailable see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of dividend capacities and limitations 

  

for the year 2006 repayments of longterm debt exceeded issuances of mediumterm and longterm debt resulting in net cash outflows of 1428 million from debt financing activities specific longterm debtrelated activities for 2006 are as follows 

  

     

see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete summary of the company’s longterm borrowings 

  

on december 7 2006 the company issued 240 million of series a floatingrate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock see “capital management” beginning on page 97 for further details of this issuance 

  

on a consolidated basis fundings from shortterm borrowings exceeded repayments excluding shortterm fhlb borrowings and resulted in a 6833 million source of cash in 2006 the parent has a program to issue shortterm commercial paper and at december 31 2006 outstanding commercial paper was 2205 million in addition the parent has a 40 million secured revolving credit facility with a subsidiary bank no amount was outstanding on this facility at december 31 2006 

  

access to funding markets for the parent and subsidiary banks is directly tied to the credit ratings they receive from various rating agencies the ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings but can also influence the sources of the borrowings the parent had the following ratings as of december 31 2006 

  

schedule 44 

  

credit ratings 

  

   

any downgrade in these ratings could negatively impact the parent’s ability to borrow including higher costs of funds and access to fewer funding sources 

  

the subsidiaries’ primary source of funding is their core deposits consisting of demand savings and money market deposits time deposits under 100000 and foreign deposits at december 31 2006 these core deposits in aggregate constituted 877 of consolidated deposits compared with 923 of consolidated deposits at december 31 2005 for 2006 deposit increases resulted in net cash inflows of 23 billion which primarily resulted from a 18 billion increase in noncore deposit “jumbo cds” or time deposits greater than 100000 

  

the fhlb system is also a significant source of liquidity for each of the company’s subsidiary banks zions bank and tcbw are members of the fhlb of seattle cbt nsb and nba are members of the fhlb of san francisco vectra is a member of the fhlb of topeka and amegy is a member of the fhlb of dallas the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans to satisfy liquidity requirements for 2006 the activity in shortterm fhlb borrowings resulted in a net cash inflow of 4991 million amounts of unused lines of credit available for additional fhlb advances totaled 61 billion at december 31 2006 subject to availability of collateral and certain requirements borrowings from the fhlb may increase in the future depending on availability of funding from other sources such as deposits however the subsidiary banks must maintain their fhlb memberships to continue accessing this source of funding 

  

as explained earlier the company has used asset securitizations to sell loans which also provides an alternative source of funding for the subsidiaries and enhances flexibility in meeting funding needs during 2006 loan sales other than proceeds from loans held for sale included in cash flows from operating activities provided 218 million in cash inflows 

  

at december 31 2006 the company managed approximately 26 billion of securitized assets that were originated or purchased by its subsidiary banks of these approximately 16 billion were creditenhanced by a third party insurance provider and held in lockhart which is a qspe securities conduit and has been an important source of funding for the company’s loans zions bank provides a liquidity facility for a fee to lockhart which purchases floatingrate us government and aaarated securities with funds from the issuance of commercial paper zions bank also provides interest rate hedging support and administrative and investment advisory services for a fee pursuant to the liquidity facility zions bank is required to purchase securities from lockhart to provide funds for it to repay maturing commercial paper upon lockhart’s inability to access the commercial paper market or upon a commercial paper market disruption as specified in the governing documents of lockhart in addition pursuant to the governing documents including the liquidity facility if any security in lockhart is downgraded below aa zions bank must either 1 place its letter of credit on the security 2 obtain a credit enhancement on the security from a third party or 3 purchase the security from lockhart at book value at any given time the maximum commitment of zions bank is the book value of lockhart’s securities portfolio which is not allowed to exceed the size of the liquidity facility 

  

at december 31 2006 the book value of lockhart’s securities portfolio was 41 billion which approximated market value and the size of the liquidity facility commitment was 612 billion no amounts were outstanding under this liquidity facility at december 31 2006 or december 31 2005 lockhart is limited in size by program agreements and by the size of the liquidity facility 

  

in june 2005 under the liquidity facility contract zions bank repurchased for the first time a bond from lockhart at its book value of 124 million because of a rating downgrade zions bank recognized an impairment loss of 16 million which was included in fixed income securities gains losses for 2005 in june 2006 this security was sold and zions bank recovered 08 million of the loss 

  

the fasb has recently issued two accounting pronouncements that amend sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities these amendments did not impact the operating activities of lockhart however other proposals to further amend sfas no 140 may require changes to the operating activities of qspes and other aspects relating to the transfer of financial assets as a result of these proposals lockhart’s operations may need to be modified to preserve its offbalance sheet status further discussion of lockhart can be found in the section entitled “offbalancesheet arrangements” on page 76 and in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

while not considered a primary source of funding the company’s investment activities can also provide or use cash depending on the assetliability management posture that is being observed for 2006 investment securities activities resulted in net cash inflows of 229 million 

  

maturing balances in the various loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows in most cases however loan growth has resulted in net cash outflows from a funding standpoint for 2006 loan growth resulted in a net cash outflow of 49 billion as compared to 36 billion in 2005 we expect that loans will continue to be a use of funding rather than a source in 2007 

  

operational risk management 

  

operational risk is the potential for unexpected losses attributable to human error systems failures fraud or inadequate internal controls and procedures in its ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk the company has created an operating risk management group whose responsibility is to help company management identify and monitor the key internal controls and processes that the company has in place to mitigate operational risk we have documented controls and the control self assessment related to financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 

  

to manage and minimize its operating risk the company has in place transactional documentation requirements systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions regulatory compliance reviews and periodic reviews by the company’s internal audit and credit examination departments in addition reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data further we maintain contingency plans and systems for operations support in the event of natural or other disasters we expect to continue efforts to improve the company’s oversight of operational risk in 2007 

  

capital management 

  

the board of directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management the board has established the capital management committee “cmc” whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the company other major cmc responsibilities include 

  

    

the cmc in managing the capital of the company may set capital standards that are higher than those approved by the board but may not set lower limits 

  

the company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior riskadjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital we believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence specifically it is the policy of the parent and each of the subsidiary banks to 

  

      

see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on riskbased capital 

  

it is our belief that capital not considered necessary to support current and anticipated business should be returned to the company’s shareholders through dividends and repurchases of its shares 

  

in december 2006 the company resumed its stock repurchase plan which had been suspended since july 2005 because of the amegy acquisition the board authorized a 400 million repurchase program the company repurchased and retired 308359 shares of its common stock in 2006 at a total cost of 250 million and an average per share price of 8105 under this share repurchase authorization in 2005 common stock repurchases under repurchase plans totaled 1159522 shares at a total cost of 807 million and in 2004 repurchases were 1734055 shares at a cost of 1049 million the company also repurchased 15 million of shares related to the company’s restricted stock employee compensation program in both 2006 and 2005 

  

during its january 2007 meeting the board of directors declared a dividend of 039 per common share payable on february 21 2007 to shareholders of record on february 7 2007 the company paid dividends in 2006 of 147 per common share compared with 144 and 126 per share in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

in 2006 the company paid 1570 million in common stock dividends and used 265 million to repurchase common stock shares of the company in total we returned to shareholders 1835 million out of total net income of 5831 million or 315 the company paid 1303 million in common stock dividends in 2005 and used 822 million to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock in total we returned to shareholders 2125 million out of total net income of 4801 million or 443 

  

  

total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2006 increased to 50 billion an increase of 177 over the 42 billion at december 31 2005 resulting mainly from retained earnings and the issuance of preferred stock tangible equity was 29 billion at the end of 2006 and 22 billion at the end of 2005 

  

on december 7 2006 the company issued 240 million of depositary shares the 9600000 depositary shares each represent a 140th ownership interest in a share of series a floatingrate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock the issuance was priced at an annual rate equal to the greater of threemonth libor plus 052 or 4 the series a preferred stock is not redeemable prior to december 15 2011 on and after that date the series a preferred stock will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to 1000 per share equivalent to 25 per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends without accumulation of any undeclared dividends 

  

the company declared a preferred stock dividend of 38 million in december 2006 for the quarterly dividend to be paid to shareholders on march 15 2007 under the terms of the zions series a preferred stock this dividend had to be declared and funds set aside to pay the dividend before zions could begin repurchasing common shares under the 400 million repurchase authorization announced on december 11 2006 

  

the company’s capital ratios were as follows at december 31 2006 and 2005 

  

schedule 45 

  

capital ratios 

  

   

the increased tangible equity ratio at december 31 2006 reflects the impact of the perpetual preferred stock issuance previously discussed the increases in the capital ratios reflect the increased earnings for 2006 and the suspension of the company’s share repurchase programs for most of 2006 

  

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskcapital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bcbs” the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply in january 2001 the bcbs released a proposal to replace basel i with a new capital framework “basel ii” that would set capital requirements for operational risk and materially change the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures operational risk is defined by the proposal as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events basel i does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 

  

in september 2006 the us banking regulators issued an interagency advance notice of proposed rulemaking “npr” with regard to the us implementation of the basel ii framework final rules are expected to be published by midyear 2007 the regulators have previously stated that approximately the ten largest us bank holding companies will be required to adopt the new standard and that others may elect to “opt in” we do not currently expect to be an early “opt in” bank holding company as the company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt basel ii however we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to companies that do adopt the framework may make it necessary for the company to elect to “opt in” at some point and we have begun investing in the required capabilities and required data 

  

also in december 2006 the us banking regulators issued another npr for modifications to the basel ia framework for those banks not adopting basel ii the regulatory agencies are currently evaluating the numerous comments received on this proposal which is commonly referred to as basel ia as proposed basel ia would appear to narrow somewhat the regulatory capital disparities between basel ii and the existing basel i framework for some lines of business however given the company’s mix of business it does not expect to derive a significant capital benefit if basel ia is adopted substantially as proposed

the enactment of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 “the glb act” represented a pivotal point in the history of the financial services industry the glb act swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the depression era of the 1930s effective march 11 2000 new opportunities became available for banks other depository institutions insurance companies and securities firms to enter into business combinations that permit a single financial services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial products and services the glb act provides a new regulatory framework through a financial holding company which has as its umbrella regulator the federal reserve board “frb” the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a holding company is conducted by the subsidiary’s primary functional regulator to qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company a company must satisfy certain ongoing criteria

the bhc act restricts the company’s nonbanking activities to those that are permitted for financial holding companies or that have been determined by the frb to be financial in nature incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity the bhc act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies 

  

the company’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to various requirements and restrictions in both the laws of the united states and the states in which the banks operate these include restrictions on 

  

        

in addition the company’s subsidiary banks are subject to either the provisions of the national bank act or the banking laws of their respective states as well as the rules and regulations of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” they are also under the supervision of and are subject to periodic examination by the occ or their respective state banking departments the frb and the fdic 

  

the frb has established capital guidelines for financial holding companies the occ the fdic and the frb have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks failure to meet capital requirements could subject the company and its subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement remedies see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding capital requirements 

  

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskcapital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision the “bis” the bis is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply in january 2001 the bis released a proposal to replace the 1988 accord with a new capital framework that would set capital requirements for operational risk and materially change the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk 

  

exposures operational risk is defined by the proposal to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events the 1988 accord does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 

  

in january 2005 the us banking regulators issued an interagency statement with regard to the us implementation of the basel ii framework they have set january 2008 as the effective date for the final regulations with midyear 2006 for the publication of the final rule the regulators have previously stated that approximately the ten largest us bank holding companies will be required to adopt the new standard and that others may elect to “opt in” we do not currently expect to be an early “opt in” bank holding company as the company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt basel ii however we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to companies that do adopt the framework will make it necessary for the company to elect to “opt in” at some point and we have begun investing in the required capabilities 

  

also in october 2005 the us banking regulators issued an interagency advance notice of proposed rulemaking for modifications to the basel i framework for those banks not adopting basel ii the regulatory agencies are currently evaluating the numerous comments received on this proposal which is commonly referred to as basel 1a 

  

dividends payable by the subsidiary banks to the parent are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions these restrictions and the amount available for the payment of dividends at yearend are summarized in note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 provides that the company’s bank subsidiaries are liable for any loss incurred by the fdic in connection with the failure of an affiliated insured bank 

  

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 prescribes standards for the safety and soundness of insured banks these standards relate to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulatory agencies 

  

the community reinvestment act “cra” requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities including credit to low and moderate income individuals should the company or its subsidiaries fail to adequately serve their communities penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates and merge with or purchase other financial institutions the glb act requires “satisfactory” or higher cra compliance for insured depository institutions and their financial holding companies for them to engage in new financial activities if one of the company’s banks should receive a cra rating of less than satisfactory the company could lose its status as a financial holding company 

  

on october 26 2001 the president signed into law comprehensive antiterrorism legislation known as the usa patriot act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” title iii of the usa patriot act substantially broadens the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations defining new crimes and related penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states the us treasury department “the treasury” has issued a number of implementation regulations which apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions the company’s bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by the company’s subsidiaries must comply with these regulations these regulations also impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 

  

failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution the company has adopted appropriate policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the usa patriot act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the act and the treasury’s regulations 

  

regulators congress and state legislatures continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and to protect consumers the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

  

government monetary policies 

  

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by fiscal and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the policies of the frb which affects the national supply of bank credit the methods of monetary policy available to the frb include 

  

      

these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

  

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

on october 26 2001 the president signed into law comprehensive antiterrorism legislation known as the usa patriot act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” title iii of the usa patriot act substantially broadens the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations defining new crimes and related penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states the us treasury department “the treasury” has issued a number of implementation regulations which apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions the company’s bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by the company’s subsidiaries must comply with these regulations these regulations also impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 

  

failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution the company has adopted appropriate policies procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the usa patriot act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the act and the treasury’s regulations 

  

regulators and congress continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and to protect consumers the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

  

government monetary policies 

  

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by fiscal and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the policies of the 

  

frb which affects the national supply of bank credit the methods of monetary policy available to the frb include 

  

      

these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

  

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

supervision and regulation 

  

on july 30 2002 the senate and the house of representatives of the united states congress enacted the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 a law that addresses among other issues corporate governance auditing and accounting executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information the nasdaq stock market inc has also proposed corporate governance rules which intend to allow shareholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 

  

the board of directors of zions bancorporation has implemented a system of strong corporate governance practices this system included corporate governance guidelines a code of business conduct and ethics and charters for the audit credit review executive compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees more information on zions bancorporation’s corporate governance practices is available on the zions bancorporation website at wwwzionsbancorporationcom  

  

the enactment of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 “the glb act” represented a pivotal point in the history of the financial services industry the glb act swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the depression era of the 1930s effective march 11 2000 new opportunities became available for banks other depository institutions insurance companies and securities firms to enter into business combinations that permit a single financial services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial products and services the glb act provides a new regulatory framework through a financial holding company which has as its umbrella regulator the federal reserve board “frb” the functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a holding company is conducted by the subsidiary’s primary functional regulator 

  

the glb act also provides federal regulations dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal information of individual customers which the company and its subsidiaries must comply with in addition the company including its subsidiaries is subject to various state laws that deal with the use and distribution of nonpublic personal information

the bhc act restricts the company’s nonbanking activities to those that are permitted for financial holding companies or that have been determined by the frb to be financial in nature incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity the bhc act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies the company’s banking subsidiaries however are subject to limitations with respect to transactions with affiliates 

  

the company’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to various requirements and restrictions in both the laws of the united states and the states in which the banks operate these include 

  

       

in addition the company’s subsidiary banks are subject to either the provisions of the national bank act or the banking laws of their respective states as well as the rules and regulations of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” they are also under the supervision of and are subject to periodic examination by the occ or their respective state banking departments the frb and the fdic 

  

the frb has established capital guidelines for financial holding companies the occ the fdic and the frb have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks failure to meet capital requirements could subject the company and its subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement remedies see note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding capital requirements 

  

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision “the bis” the bis is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply in january 2001 the bis released a proposal to replace the 1988 capital accord with a new capital accord that would set capital requirements for operational risk and materially change the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures operational risk is defined by the proposal to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events the 1988 capital accord does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk 

  

the bis has stated that its objective is to finalize a new capital accord for implementation by the member countries at yearend 2006 “basel ii” since the accord is not yet final the ultimate timing for implementation and the specifics of capital assessments for addressing operational risk are still uncertain however the company expects that a new capital accord will eventually be adopted by the bis and implemented by the us federal bank regulatory agencies the company is evaluating what effect the new capital requirements that may arise out of a new bis capital accord may have on its minimum capital requirements us banking regulators have stated that the approximately ten largest us bank holding companies will be required to adopt the new standard and that others may “opt in” the company does not currently expect to be an early “opt in” bank and does not have in place the data collection and analytic capabilities necessary to adopt basel ii however it believes that competitive advantages afforded to banks that do adopt may make it necessary for the company to adopt the new basel ii approach at some point and it is currently investing in the required capabilities 

  

dividends payable by the subsidiary banks to the parent are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions these restrictions and the amount available for the payment of dividends at yearend are summarized in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

  

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future

competition 

  

zions bancorporation and its subsidiaries operate in a highly competitive environment due to the diverse financial services and products they offer competitors include not only other banks thrift institutions credit unions and mutual funds but also insurance companies finance companies brokerage firms securities dealers investment banking companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as the company most of these competitors compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in many significant products these competitive trends are likely to continue 

  

supervision and regulation 

  

zions bancorporation is a financial holding company and as such is subject to regulation under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended “the bhc act” the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve board “frb” for a financial holding company to 

  

 

acquire or hold more than 5 voting interest in any bank and restricts interstate banking activities the bhc act allows interstate bank acquisitions and interstate branching by acquisition anywhere in the country 

  

the bhc act restricts the company’s nonbanking activities to those which are permitted for bank holding companies or determined by the frb to be financial in nature incidental to financial activities or complementary to financial activities the bhc act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies the company’s banking subsidiaries are subject to limitations with respect to transactions with affiliates 

  

the company’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to various requirements and restrictions in the laws of the united states and in the states in which the banks operate these include restrictions on the amount of loans to a borrower and its affiliates the nature and amount of their investments their ability to act as an underwriter of securities the opening of branches and the acquisition of other financial entities the company’s subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the national bank act or the banking laws of their respective states are under the supervision of and are subject to periodic examination by the comptroller of the currency “occ” or their respective state banking departments and are subject to the rules and regulations of the occ the frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

  

the frb has established capital guidelines for financial holding companies the occ the fdic and the frb have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks under federal law failure to meet capital requirements could subject the company and its subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement remedies see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding capital requirements 

  

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ riskcapital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision “the bis” the bis is a committee of central banks and bank supervisorsregulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply in january 2001 the bis released a proposal to replace the 1988 capital accord with a new capital accord that would set capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures operational risk is defined to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events the 1988 capital accord does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk the events of september 11 2001 demonstrate the importance for financial institutions of managing operational risks the bis has stated that its objective is to finalize a new capital accord in 2002 and for member countries to implement the new accord in 2005 the ultimate timing for the new accord and the specifics of capital assessments for addressing operational risk are uncertain however the company expects that a new capital accord addressing operational risk will eventually be adopted by the bis and implemented by the us federal bank regulatory agencies 

  

in january 2002 the federal bank regulators adopted rules effective april 1 2002 governing the regulatory capital treatment of equity investments in nonfinancial companies the federal rules require a series of marginal capital charges on covered equity investments that increase with the level of those investments as a percentage of tier 1 capital with certain exceptions the rules 

  

 

require that the company and its bank subsidiaries deduct from tier 1 capital the appropriate percentage set out in the following table 

  

 

  

the effect that the newly adopted rules may have on the company’s subsidiary banks is not expected to be significant 

  

dividends payable by the subsidiary banks to zions bancorporation are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions these restrictions and the amount available for the payment of dividends at yearend are summarized in note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 provides that the company’s bank subsidiaries are liable for any loss incurred by the fdic in connection with the failure of an affiliated insured bank 

  

because of favorable loss experience and a healthy reserve ratio in the bank insurance fund “bif” of the fdic well capitalized and well managed banks including the company’s bank subsidiaries have in recent years paid relatively small premiums for fdic insurance a number of factors suggest that as early as the second half of 2002 even well capitalized and well managed banks will be required to pay premiums on deposit insurance the amount of any such premiums will depend on the outcome of legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as the bif loss experience and other factors none of which the company is in a position to predict at this time 

  

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 prescribes standards for the safety and soundness of insured banks these standards relate to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulatory agencies 

  

the community reinvestment act “cra” requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities including credit to low and moderate income individuals should the company or its subsidiaries fail to adequately serve their communities penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates and merge with or purchase other financial institutions 

  

the enactment of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 “the glb act” represented a pivotal point in the history of the financial services industry the glb act swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the depression era of the 1930s effective march 11 2000 new opportunities became available for banks other depository institutions insurance companies and securities firms to enter into combinations that permit a single financial services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial products and services the 

  

 

glb act provides a new regulatory framework through a financial holding company which has as its umbrella regulator the frb functional regulation of the financial holding company’s separately regulated subsidiaries is conducted by their primary functional regulator among other things the glb act requires “satisfactory” or higher cra compliance for insured depository institutions and their financial holding companies in order for them to engage in new financial activities the glb act provides a federal right to privacy of nonpublic personal information of individual customers the company including its subsidiaries is also subject to certain state laws that deal with the use and distribution of nonpublic personal information 

  

on october 26 2001 the president signed into law comprehensive antiterrorism legislation known as the usa patriot act title iii of the usa patriot act requires financial institutions including the company’s bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries to help prevent detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism the company’s bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries have augmented their systems and procedures to accomplish this objective the secretary of the treasury has proposed additional regulations to further implement title iii although the company cannot predict when and in what form these regulations will be adopted the company believes that the cost of compliance with title iii of the usa patriot act is not likely to be material to the company 

  

regulators and congress continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and to protect consumers the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 

  

government monetary policies 

  

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by fiscal and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the policies of the frb which affects the national supply of bank credit the instruments and methods of monetary policy available to the frb include openmarket operations in us government securities adjustment of the discount rates or cost of bank borrowings imposing or changing reserve requirements against member bank deposits and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 

  

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the frb’s monetary policies it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business and earnings of the company frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2001 the company employed approximately 8124 fulltime equivalent personnel with approximately 6665 employed by the banking subsidiaries the company had 6915 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2000 compared to 6833 at december 31 1999 the company believes that it enjoys good employee relations in addition to competitive

insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of
1933 may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act
of 1933 and is therefore unenforceable in the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action suit or
proceeding is asserted by such director officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered the registrant will unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue

the enactment of the grahamleachbliley act of 1999 the glb act represented
a pivitol point in the history of the financial services industry the glb act
swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the
depression era of the 1930s effective march 11 2000 new opportunities became
available for banks other depository institutions insurance companies and
securities firms to enter into combinations that permit a single financial
services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial
products and services the glb act provides a new regulatory framework for
regulation through the financial holding company which has as its umbrella
regulator the federal reserve board functional regulation of the financial
holding companys separately regulated subsidiaries is conducted by their
primary functional regulator the glb act requires satisfactory or higher cra
compliance for insured depository institutions and their financial holding
companies in order for them to engage in new financial activities the glb act
provides a federal right to privacy of nonpublic personal information of
individual customers the company including its subsidiaries is also subject
to certain state laws that deal with the use and distribution of nonpublic
personal information

during 2000 the securities and exchange commission issued regulation fd which
established affirmative disclosure requirements on public corporations such that
material nonpublic information must be widely rather than selectively
disseminated regulation fd is based on the premise that full and fair
disclosure is the cornerstone of an efficient market system the company is
subject to regulation fd through regulation fd the securities and exchange
commission seeks to encourage broad public disclosure in order to increase
investor confidence in the integrity of the capital markets

regulators and congress continue to enact rules laws and policies to regulate
the industry and protect consumers the nature of these regulations and the
effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the company cannot be
predicted

government monetary policies

the earnings and business of the company are affected not only by general
economic conditions but also by fiscal and other policies adopted by various
governmental authorities the company is particularly affected by the policies
of the federal reserve board which affects the national supply of bank credit
the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board
include openmarket operations in united states government securities
manipulation of the discount rates of member bank borrowings imposing or
changing reserve requirements against member bank deposits and imposing or
changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their
affiliates these methods are used in varying combinations to influence the
overall growth of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates
charged on loans or paid for deposits

in view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the credit
policies of monetary authorities it is difficult to predict future changes in
loan demand deposit levels and interest rates or their effect on the business
and earnings of the company federal reserve monetary policies have had a
significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and
are expected to continue to do so in the future

insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of
1933 may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act
of 1933 and is therefore unenforceable in the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action suit or
proceeding is asserted by such director officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered the registrant will unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue
