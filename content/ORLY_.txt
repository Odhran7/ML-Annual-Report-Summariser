our business 

​ 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values including superior customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both diy and professional service provider customers

​ 

competitive advantages 

​ 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated 

​ 

​ 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

for more than 40 years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers capitalizing on our existing store and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers

​ 

in 2021 we derived approximately 59 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 41 of our sales from our professional service provider customers historically we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business due to our systems knowledge industryleading parts availability and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket augmented by our approximately 750 fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets

​ 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the correct automotive products needed to complete their repairs accordingly each o’reilly store carries or has same or next day availability to a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell

​ 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below

 ​ 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard part repairs in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people see our “team members and human capital management” disclosure of the “business” section of this annual report on form 10k for more information about our technically proficient professional parts people

​ 

​ 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 28 regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 158000 stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust distribution network we operate a total of 375 hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 45000 skus from a hub or 80000 to 92000 skus from a super hub to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

​ 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior managers district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team that has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 29 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 see our “team members and human capital management” disclosure of the “business” section of this annual report on form 10k for more information about our experienced management team

​ 

growth strategy 

​ 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2021 we opened 165 net new domestic stores and three new stores in mexico in 2022 we plan to open 175 to 185 net new stores which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores by

 ​ 

new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts vehicles in operation number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius

​ 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have and continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy

​ 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates sustainable increased sales and profitability

​ 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains like o’reilly to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention 

​ 

is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets domestic and international

​ 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features optimized square footage high ceilings convenient interior store layouts instore signage multilingual signage when appropriate bright lighting convenient ingress and egress ample parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 2021 while experiencing constraints to construction timing due to the covid19 pandemic we relocated 12 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 1200 additional stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best attract and serve our customers 

​ 

omnichannel growth strategy 

our omnichannel growth strategies reflect the continued evolution of customer preferences in researching and completing purchases more than ever before our customers’ purchase decisions are informed by a range of interactions whether inperson over the phone or through a variety of digital channels as they seek to find the professional parts knowledge and the product availability they need to meet their automotive repair and maintenance needs our omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering our customers an enhanced and seamless research and buying experience through any of these channels we have long been known for excellent customer service and continue to grow the functionality and userfriendliness of our digital platforms including wwworeillyautocom and wwwfirstcallonlinecom  to enhance our customers’ shopping experience many of our customers interact over multiple channels to research and complete a purchase and the functionality and features of our digital sites complement the outstanding customer service provided in our brick and mortar locations

​ 

team members and human capital management 

​ 

our tradition for 65 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of each team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and respect has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

​ 

we are committed to providing a work environment that allows team members to feel highly valued and to be productive and effective in their jobs by maintaining an inclusive environment and healthy worklife balance which we believe increases employee engagement our ongoing emphasis on diversity and inclusion including our policies recruitment and selection procedures onboarding processes and training efforts positively builds upon our successful “promote from within” philosophy and growth strategies 

​ 

talent acquisition retention and training 

our company knows the value of a tenured team which is why our philosophy is to “promote from within” first as management opportunities arise we look first within the company and promote those who have performed well have the right expertise and have shown leadership potential before looking outside the company however we augment this philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience when appropriate this comprehensive approach increases team member commitment and has resulted in a very experienced leadership team as of december 31 2021 our strong management team was comprised of 229 senior managers who average 20 years of service 289 corporate managers who average 16 years of service and 574 district managers who average 14 years of service

​ 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 574 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores which provides our stores with strong operational support

​ 

we offer a variety of specific training programs that address a broad spectrum of topics from store and distribution center operations to customer service we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers therefore our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from professional parts people particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business

​ 

​ 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts and repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase”

​ 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager these team members then spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development

​ 

additionally store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a weeklong manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training programs field workshops regional meetings and our annual leadership conference

​ 

diversity and inclusion 

at o’reilly valuing diversity is about creating an environment in which our team members feel included respected and have opportunities to do their best work and achieve their greatest potential we believe diversity within the workplace is crucial in running our business and building the best team of professional parts people to serve our customers we are committed to recruiting and building a diverse team through ongoing leadership development and actively identifying emerging talent in order to ensure our diversity and inclusion efforts are successful we survey our team members and build action plans and programs aimed at improving our work environments for our team members and customers 

​ 

compensation benefits and recognition 

our compensation philosophy has always been to incentivize team members to “run it like you own it” and we continually evaluate and benchmark our comprehensive compensation programs to ensure they remain competitive providing an important tool to attract and retain the best and most qualified team members in every market we provide financial incentives to all store team members through various incentive compensation programs store team members have the opportunity to earn incentive pay that increases their base hourly wage consistent with their individual performance or the performance of their store store managers district managers region directors and division vice presidents have the ability to earn additional compensation above their salary or base hourly wage based upon the performance of their stores in addition beginning with the district manager level we augment our competitive programs with sharebased compensation we believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our team members

​ 

just as pay benefits and growth opportunities are critically important to our team member success we believe it is equally important to recognize team members for a job well done we regularly present many awards that range from recognizing individual service longevity to performance allowing peertopeer recognition or management nomination of an individual’s excellent performance 

​ 

team composition 

we recognize that each and every one of our team members plays a very important role in our ability to provide outstanding customer service and achieve consistent successful performance as of january 31 2022 we employed 83636 team members 68679 fulltime team members and 14957 parttime team members of whom 68086 were employed at our us stores 10071 were employed at our us dcs 3750 were employed at our us corporate and regional offices and 1729 were employed in mexico ours is an increasingly technical business creating the need for knowledgeable professional parts people and our ongoing focus on developing a technically proficient team has resulted in the growth of the mix of our fulltime work force increasing from 65 at january 31 2020 to 82 at january 31 2022 while fulltime professional parts people play a vital role in our ongoing success the flexibility of incorporating parttime employment into our work force is also an important component of providing excellent customer service many of our parttime team members choose to work at o’reilly while attending school or during other transitional periods in their lives or simply because of their passion for cars and knowledge of auto parts parttime team members have the opportunity to become career professional parts people because of our promote from within philosophy and many of our leaders today began their careers as parttime team members in our stores or distribution centers 

​ 

​ 

a union represents 419 team members in 49 stores in the greater bay area in california and has for many years there are 62 team members that drive overtheroad trucks in two of our domestic dcs that are also represented by a labor union additionally two unions represent approximately 1000 team members in mexico stores and dcs we consider our current relationship with these unions and union team members to be excellent with the exception of the previously described team members our team members are not represented by labor unions 

​ 

additional information about our team member population and human capital management practices can be found in our most recent sustainability social and governance report which is available on our website at wwworeillyautocom  our sustainability social and governance report is not and will not be deemed to be a part of this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2021 or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the securities and exchange commission

​ 

store network 

​ 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are

 ​ 

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market

​ 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our us stores on average carry approximately 21000 skus and average approximately 7500 total square feet in size at december 31 2021 we had a total of approximately 43 million square feet in our 5759 domestic stores our domestic stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 158000 skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 375 hub stores which are comprised of 281 hubs that average approximately 10200 square feet and carry an average of 45000 skus and 94 larger super hubs that average approximately to 19300 square feet and carry an average of 80000 to 92000 skus

​ 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers

​ 

​ 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2021 and 2020

 ​ 

​ 

distribution systems 

​ 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while optimizing our inventory investment by controlling the depth of our store stocked inventory moreover we believe our ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc network allow us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each dc as of december 31 2021 we had a total growth capacity of 300 to 450 stores in our distribution network which benefited from completing the relocation of our knoxville tennessee dc into our larger dc facility in lebanon tennessee the existing store portion of our knoxville tennessee dc facility remains a large hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the knoxville market additionally we opened our new horn lake mississippi dc in 2021 and when appropriate we plan to merge our north little rock arkansas dc into our new horn lake mississippi dc at that time the existing store portion of our north little rock arkansas dc facility will remain a large hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the little rock market

​ 

distribution centers 

as of december 31 2021 we operated 28 domestic dcs comprised of approximately 121 million operating square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for more information about dc operating square footages our dcs stock an average of 158000 skus and most dcs are linked to and have access to multiple other regional dcs’ inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to substantially all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within an individual dc’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the dc’s “city counter” many of which receive this service seven days per week our dcs provide service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic hub locations which redistribute products to surrounding stores our national hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores

​ 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2022 we plan to

 ​ 

hub stores

​

​ 

​ 

we have no longterm contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers we have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good

​ 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 685 suppliers the five largest of which accounted for approximately 25 of our total purchases in 2021 our largest supplier in 2021 accounted for approximately 8 of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3 to 6 of our total purchases

​ 

marketing 

​ 

retail and online marketing 

our integrated marketing strategy and omnichannel efforts include national media channels instore digital and social media activation as well as marketing the o’reilly brand through automotive event sponsorships and onsite appearances throughout the country our o’rewards loyalty program encourages repeat customers as they accumulate points from their o’reilly purchases that are redeemable for rewards at various purchase levels our marketing efforts also target the spanishspeaking market through broadcast media print and sports marketing as well as sponsorships of local and regional events

​ 

professional marketing 

to develop our continued relationships with professional service providers and installers we employ territory sales managers in nearly every market to ensure complete sales territory coverage and personalized service for professional customers flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are distributed on a regular basis to all professional service providers including paint and body shops and fleet maintenance customers to encourage brand and program awareness in addition our professional customer program first call also offers a proprietary ordering and other services platform called wwwfirstcallonlinecom  dedicated professional service specialists in stores multiple daily deliveries and access to training opportunities shop management maintenance supplies and the certified auto repair program which offers professional service providers with the business tools they need to profitably grow and market their business 

​ 

industry environment 

​ 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 325 billion according to the auto care association this market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales we estimate that o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately 130 billion to 140 billion which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and diy sales at retail we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations 

​ 

competition 

​ 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with

 ​ 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout the omnichannel experience and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital including the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and 

​ 

working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket

​ 

inflation and seasonality 

​ 

we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increased due to price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations

​ 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

​ 

regulations 

​ 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business as well as the health and safety of our team members and customers including but not limited to those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property

​ 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our used oil oil filter and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty suppliers the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into supplierprovided containers and pallets and then recycled by the thirdparty suppliers in general our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the supplier

​ 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date however we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

​ 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements

​ 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

​ 

the ongoing occurrence of covid19 or any other such widespread public health crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the us and world economies the public health concerns resulting from the pandemic have created significant uncertainty economic disruption and volatility all of which have impacted and may continue to impact our business we may be required to take significant actions to mitigate any adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic including but not limited to incurring increased expenses we are unable to predict the ongoing shortterm and longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our customers team members supply chain business overall industry demand results of operations financial condition and cash flows due to several factors beyond our control including but not limited to



​ 

 ​ 

the above factors and uncertainties in addition to others we are not currently aware of may result in adverse impacts to our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

risks specific to our business and industry 

​ 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending such as a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic like the covid19 pandemic many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us changes in vehicle technology used by the original equipment manufacturers “oem” on future vehicles including but not limited to electric hybrid and internal combustion engines may result in less frequent repairs parts lasting longer or elimination of certain repairs in addition restrictions on access to telematics diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the oems or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities furthermore the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may worsen if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions the cause of which could include a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortments between us and a range of competitors which could result in pricing pressure some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional instore experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust regional distribution footprint which could also create pricing pressure we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

​ 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased unrecoverable losses resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers the limited supply or unavailability of key products supply chain disruptions or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them in addition the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted when our suppliers or our supply chain experiences work stoppages labor strikes a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic shipping and transportation disruptions or increased costs currency fluctuations or inflation or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase changes in us trade policies sanctions practices tariffs or taxes import limitations and other factors relating to foreign trade and port agreements could affect our ability to source products and our suppliers’ ability to source materials or provide products at current volumes andor prices these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours stability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

failure to protect our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our reputation is based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities negative publicity involving the company our merchandise or our industry in general that erode customer trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and business failure to comply with ethical social product labor health and safety accounting or environmental standards or existing or future laws or regulations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions from consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies which could require us to incur substantial legal fees and costs in addition negative claims or publicity including the availability of information and opinions on social media as its impact is immediate could adversely affect our reputation the opportunity for the rapid dissemination of information including inaccurate and inflammatory information and opinions is virtually limitless and easily accessible damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

​ 

risks associated with international operations could result in additional costs and inefficiencies 

in addition to many of the risks we face in our us operations international operations present a unique set of risks and challenges including local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions our ability 

​ 

to operate effectively and grow in international markets could be impacted by these risks resulting in legal liabilities additional costs and the distraction of management’s attention compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and protection of intellectual property rights surrounding items such as tradenames and trademarks in foreign jurisdictions can pose significant challenges

​ 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries given that our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance

​ 

risks related to our common stock 

​ 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer

​ 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions and potentially being targeted through the selling and buying of our common stock by a group of individuals whose interests and reasoning behind such actions may not align with an average market participant the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations and failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

​ 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such companies if similar litigation were initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business

​ 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing 

​ 

our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences for our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things

 ​ 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

​ 

​ 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs 

credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our unsecured senior notes preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flows

​ 

general risks 

​ 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2022 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

in order to be successful we will need to attract retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following

 ​ 

we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we or the subsequent owner or operator may be liable

​ 

a breach of customer supplier team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the receiving storage and transmitting of certain personally identifiable or confidential information about our customers suppliers team members and the company some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have taken significant and appropriate steps to protect this information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry and national clearing house standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our systems however these security measures are costly and require constant ongoing attention and may not prevent a security breach due to cyberattacks computer malware viruses exploitation of hardware or software vulnerabilities team member error malfeasance system compromises fraud hacking trickery or other intentional or unintentional acts which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information 

​ 

a compromise of our security measures or those of a thirdparty party we entrust could result in information related to our customers suppliers team members or the company being obtained or misused by unauthorized persons adverse operational effects or interruptions or costs to the company to address the breach all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales litigation or possible regulatory action in addition the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process which may require the investment of additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with privacy laws and regulations the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us there is no guarantee that the procedures that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations and employment legislation and regulations may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law new or more stringent climate changerelated mandates laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing mandates laws or regulations could potentially be forthcoming these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices or requiring additional expenditures by us or our suppliers to comply which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment legislation andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

of the 5784 stores we operated at december 31 2021 2395 stores were owned 3318 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties 24 of which were located in mexico and 71 stores were leased from entities that include one or more of our affiliated directors or members of their immediate family leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with two of the five affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from december 31 2022 to december 31 2029 we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those of third parties

we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and our consumers including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment trends interest rates and other economic factors macroeconomic factors such as total us unemployment and demand drivers specific to the automotive aftermarket such as us miles driven have been pressured as a result of responses to the covid19 pandemic including stay at home orders work from home arrangements and reduced travel however government stimulus and additional unemployment benefits the ongoing gradual reopening processes across markets we operate in and increased miles driven have positively impacted our performance due to the nature of these macroeconomic factors we are unable to determine how long current conditions including the pandemic will persist and the degree of impact future changes may have on our business industry or broader economic conditions

​ 

we believe the key drivers of current and future longterm demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age

​ 

number of miles driven 

the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket in total vehicles in the us are driven approximately three trillion miles per year resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation according to the us department of transportation the number of total miles driven in the us decreased 132 in 2020 as a result of responses to the covid19 pandemic however for 2021 miles driven improved and increased 112 government measures or consumer and business behavior in response to the covid19 pandemic could again have a negative impact on miles driven but we are unable to predict the duration and severity of the impact to our business

​ 

​ 

size and age of the vehicle fleet 

the total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry as reported by the auto care association the total number of registered vehicles increased 127 from 2010 to 2020 bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 281 million by the end of 2020 although the rate of new vehicle sales has been pressured due to supply chain constraints experienced by manufacturers the outlook for the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the us “saar” was approximately 124 million for the year ended december 31 2021 the annual changes to the vehicle population resulting from new vehicle sales and the fluctuation in vehicle scrappage rates in any given year represent a small percentage of the total light vehicle population and have a muted impact on the total number and average age of vehicles on the road over the short term from 2010 to 2020 vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable ranging from 41 to 57 annually as a result over the past decade the average age of the us vehicle population has increased growing 123 from 106 years in 2010 to 119 years in 2020

​ 

we believe the increase in average vehicle age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains interiors and exteriors and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these highermileage better built vehicles the increase in average vehicle age also benefits from an environment of a new vehicle scarcity and higher than typical used vehicle prices as consumers are more willing to continue to invest in their current vehicle as the average age of vehicles on the road increases a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty these outofwarranty older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles we believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable higherquality highermileage vehicles and these investments along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products

​ 

we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service 

​ 

key events and recent developments 

​ 

a key event that has had a significant impact on our operations is the covid19 pandemic as we navigate the ongoing challenges resulting from the covid19 pandemic we continue to place additional emphasis on the safety and wellness of our team members and our customers during the year ended december 31 2021 the increased level of vaccinations the ongoing reopening processes across markets we operate in government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits positively impacted demand for the products we sell we continue to keep our stores open and operating to meet our customers’ critical needs while also ensuring the safety of our team members and customers through strict adherence to safety protocols however we cannot predict how long the current crisis will last or the extent of its future impacts on our customers our team members our supply chain and overall industry demand

​ 

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 172 billion or 15 to 1333 billion from 1160 billion for the same period in 2020 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 133 and 109 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on changes in sales for us domestic stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members as well as sales from leap day in the year ended december 31 2020 online sales resulting from shiptohome orders and pickup instore orders for stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation

​ 

​ 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2021 in millions

 ​ 

we believe the increased sales are the result of store growth the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory from our regional distribution centers and hub store network enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers the government stimulus payments enhanced unemployment benefits and general economic recovery including lifting of stay at home orders and associated ongoing market reopenings when combined with positive industry dynamics such as consumers investing in existing vehicles and favorable weather contributed to strong demand in the year ended december 31 2021 in addition despite the global supply chain disruptions that created inventory availability challenges for our industry during the year ended december 31 2021 the strength of our distribution network and our strong supplier relationships allowed us to maintain better instock inventory positions than the broader market and contributed to our sales growth

​ 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2021 was driven by increases in average ticket and transaction counts for both professional service provider and diy customers average ticket values continue to be positively impacted by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of betterengineered and more technically advanced vehicles these betterengineered more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time the resulting decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts however when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which is a benefit to average ticket values average ticket values continue to benefit from consumers spending additional time and money repairing and maintaining their vehicles in response to the covid19 pandemic the economic environment and the new and used vehicle scarcity average ticket values also benefited from increases in average selling prices on a samesku basis as compared to the same period in 2020 driven by increases in acquisition costs of inventory which were passed on in market prices 2021 transaction counts improved due to prior year headwinds to traffic from the initial covid19 stay at home orders in 2020 and business restrictions which resulted in immediate pressure to transaction counts for both diy and professional service provider customers combined with continued market reopening and recovery activity ongoing government stimulus favorable winter and spring weather conditions and a benefit from new and used vehicle scarcity positively impacting our customers’ willingness to perform or invest in maintenance on their vehicles

​ 

we opened 165 net new us stores and three new stores in mexico during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to opening 155 net new us stores and one new store in mexico during the year ended december 31 2020 as of december 31 2021 we operated 5759 stores in 47 us states and 25 stores in mexico compared to 5594 us stores in 47 states and 22 stores in mexico at december 31 2020 we anticipate new store growth will be 175 to 185 net new store openings in 2022

​ 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 15 to 702 billion or 527 of sales from 609 billion or 524 of sales for the same period in 2020 the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily the result of new store sales and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores partially offset by prior year gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to leap day the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2021 was due to a benefit from selling through inventory purchased prior to recent acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases partially offset by increased distribution costs we determine inventory cost using the lastin firstout “lifo” method but had over time seen our lifo reserve balance exhausted resulting in a lifo inventory value above replacement cost prior to the third 

​ 

quarter ended september 30 2021 our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we had effectively valued our inventory at replacement cost resulting in a benefit when selling prices increase as we sold through this lower cost inventory during 2021 our lifo reserve reverted back to a more typical credit balance due to recent significant inflation in acquisition costs as a result we anticipate a diminishing benefit moving forward from the final sell through of inventory valued at older lower replacement cost increased distribution system costs were driven by the significant increase in volumes over the past year challenging labor markets and ongoing global logistical supply chain pressures

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 12 to 410 billion or 308 of sales from 367 billion or 316 of sales for the same period in 2020 the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2021 was the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count increased incentive compensation for team members resulting from our increased sales and operating profits and prior year strict expense control measures in response to the onset of the pandemic environment the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2021 was principally due to strong leverage of fixed store operating costs on strong comparable store sales growth and higher average store sales volumes

​ 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 21 to 292 billion or 219 of sales from 242 billion or 208 of sales for the same period in 2020

​ 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased 12 to 135 million or 10 of sales from 153 million or 13 of sales for the same period in 2020 the decrease in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was the result of decreased interest expense on lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average cost of borrowings 

​ 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 20 to 617 million 222 effective tax rate from 514 million 227 effective tax rate for the same period in 2020 the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2021 was the result of higher taxable income partially offset by higher excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation and a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 was the result of the higher excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation and a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments 

​ 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 24 to 216 billion or 162 of sales from 175 billion or 151 of sales for the same period in 2020

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program our material cash requirements necessary to maintain the current operations of our longterm business strategy include but are not limited to inventory purchases human capital obligations including payroll and benefits 

​ 

contractual obligations including debt and interest obligations capital expenditures payment of income taxes and other operational priorities we expect to fund our short and longterm cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows or maintain liquidity at or above recent levels as we are unable to predict decreased demand for our products changes in customer buying patterns or the impact of the uncertainty and disruption cause by the covid19 pandemic additionally these factors could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility 

​ 

our material contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2021 included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements and interest payments related to longterm debt future minimum payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves projected obligations related to future payments under the company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan purchase obligations for construction contract commitments uncertain tax positions and associated estimated interest and penalties payments for certain deferred income taxes and commitments for the purchase of inventory all of which are included on our consolidated balance sheets we expect to fund these various commitments and obligations primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility see note 5 “leases” note 12 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” note 13 “commitments” and note 15 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our leasing arrangements sharebased compensation payments construction commitments and uncertain tax positions respectively which are not reflected in the table below 

​ 

the following table identifies the estimated payments for each of the next five years and in the aggregate thereafter of the company’s debt instruments and related interest payments and selfinsurance reserves as of december 31 2021 in thousands

 ​ 

due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms the timing of payments for certain deferred income taxes uncertain tax positions and commitments related to future payments under the company’s nonqualified compensation plan cannot be determined and are therefore excluded from the above table except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2022 which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets

​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we have entered into an agreement to make capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits we are required to make capital contributions totaling 57 million upon achievement of project milestones by the solar or wind energy farms the timing of which is variable and outside of the company’s control see note 7 “financing” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our standby letters of credit 

​ 

we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

​ 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in thousands

 

 ​ 

cash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the us were 75 million and 115 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in mexico

​ 

operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a larger decrease in net inventory investment partially offset by a decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings the larger decrease in net inventory investment in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to the strong comparable store sales growth and the resulting benefit to inventory turns the decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings is primarily due to the deferral of payroll tax payments under the cares act in 2020 

​ 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was relatively flat with the slight change due primarily to entering into more renewable energy tax credit investments in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits 

​ 

we opened 168 and 155 net new stores in 2021 and 2020 respectively we plan to open 175 to 185 net new stores in 2022 the current costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition building improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 15 million to 18 million however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site

​ 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to debt repayments of 300 million in 2021 compared to net borrowings of 236 million in 2020 and an increase in repurchases of our common stock

debt instruments 

see note 7 “financing” to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the company’s credit agreement unsecured revolving credit facility outstanding letters of credit and unsecured senior notes 

​ 

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and limit our 

​ 

ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes

​ 

the credit agreement contains certain covenants including limitations on indebtedness a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 250100 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 350100 the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense capitalized interest and rent expense the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense adjusted debt includes outstanding debt outstanding standby letters of credit and similar instruments and fivetimes rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of longterm debt in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement certain actions may be taken including but not limited to possible termination of commitments immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the credit agreement and litigation from our lenders

​ 

we had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 697 times and 593 times as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and a consolidated leverage ratio of 159 times and 192 times as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements

 ​ 

free cash flow the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial 

​ 

information we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the tables above a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures

​ 

share repurchase program 

see note 9 “share repurchase program” to the consolidated financial statements for information on our share repurchase program 

​ 

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting estimates and assumptions to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material

​ 

selfinsurance reserves 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability property loss and team member health care benefits with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities employment related claims and litigation certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability or property loss claim 

​ 

when estimating our selfinsurance liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience and trendlines projected medical and legal inflation growth patterns and exposure forecasts the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations certain of the selfinsurance liabilities are determined at an estimate of their net present value using a creditadjusted discount rate our calculation of selfinsurance liabilities requires management to apply a significant amount of subjective judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities management believes the assumptions developed and used to determine the estimate for our selfinsurance reserve are reasonable actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates which may result in material losses or gains 

​ 

as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods we adjust our selfinsurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities 

​ 

our selfinsurance reserve estimate included on our consolidated balance sheets increased 198 million from 2020 to 2021 which is primarily due to our growing operations including inflation increases in healthcare costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience if the underlying assumptions in management’s estimate changed selfinsurance reserves 10 from our estimated reserves at december 31 2021 the financial impact would have been approximately 22 million or 08 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2021 see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our selfinsurance reserves

​ 

valuation of longlived assets 

we evaluate the carrying value of finite and indefinite longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values as a component of the finite longlived assets evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future 

​ 

cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 

​ 

as a component of the indefinite longlived assets evaluation we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events or circumstances that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset have occurred as well as if they continue to support an indefinite useful life areas evaluated include changes in cost factors such as raw materials or labor financial performance including declining revenues or cash flows the legal regulatory and political environment and other industry and market considerations including the competitive environment and changes in product demand if events or market conditions exist that would more likely than not indicate that impairment may be necessary a detailed quantitative assessment would be performed 

​ 

based on our qualitative assessment we do not believe there has been a change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a calculation of fair value of indefinite longlived assets is required as of december 31 2021 our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting longterm estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact our impairment assessment see note 6 “goodwill and other intangibles” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our finite and indefinite longlived assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” with variable interest rates based on either an alternative base rate or adjusted libo rate as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility

​ 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 39 billion and 42 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at 41 billion and 46 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively which was determined by reference to quoted market prices

​ 

cash equivalents risk 

we invest certain of our excess cash balances in shortterm highlyliquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal as of december 31 2021 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3621 million

​ 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies our foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars

​ 

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 1526 million at december 31 2021 the year ended december 31 2021 exchange rates of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar weakened by approximately 30 from december 31 2020 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10 change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2021 would be approximately 139 million any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed a 10 change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations

​ 

our business 

​ 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values including superior customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both diy and professional service provider customers

​ 

​ 

competitive advantages 

​ 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated

​ 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

for more than 40 years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers capitalizing on our existing store and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers

​ 

in 2020 we derived approximately 59 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 41 of our sales from our professional service provider customers over the longterm we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business due to our systems knowledge industryleading parts availability and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket supported by our approximately 765 fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets

​ 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs accordingly each o’reilly store carries or has same or next day availability to a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell

​ 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below

 ​ 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard part repairs in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people

​ 

​ 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 28 regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 159000 stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust distribution network we operate a total of 362 hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 70000 skus from a super hub or 42000 skus from a hub to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business

​ 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of 216 senior managers who average 20 years of service 269 corporate managers who average 16 years of service and 560 district managers who average 13 years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 28 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993

​ 

growth strategy 

​ 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2020 we opened 155 net new domestic stores and one new store in mexico in 2021 we plan to open 165 to 175 net new stores which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores by

 ​ 

new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts vehicles in operation number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius

​ 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have and continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy

​ 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability

​ 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains like o’reilly to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention 

​ 

is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets domestic and crossborder

​ 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features optimized square footage high ceilings convenient interior store layouts instore signage bright lighting convenient ingress egress and parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 2020 while experiencing constraints to construction timing due to the covid19 pandemic we relocated 16 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 970 additional stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers

​ 

omnichannel growth strategy 

our omnichannel growth strategies reflect the continued evolution of customer preferences in researching and completing purchases more than ever before our customers’ purchase decisions are informed by a range of interactions whether inperson over the phone or through a variety of digital channels as they seek to find the professional parts knowledge and the product availability they need to meet their automotive repair and maintenance needs our omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering our customers an enhanced and seamless research and buying experience through any of these channels we have long been known for excellent customer service and continue to grow the functionality and userfriendliness of our websites including wwworeillyautocom and wwwfirstcallonlinecom  to enhance our customer’s shopping experience many of our customers interact over multiple channels to research and complete a purchase and the functionality and features of our digital sites complements the outstanding customer service provided in our over 5600 brick and mortar locations

​ 

team members and human capital management 

​ 

our tradition for 64 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of each team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and respect has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

​ 

we are also committed to providing a work environment where team members feel highly valued and where productivity at work is enhance by maintaining an inclusive environment and healthy worklife balance which we believe increases employee engagement our ongoing emphasis on diversity and inclusion including further ensuring our policies recruitment and selection procedures onboarding tactics and training efforts positively builds upon our successful “promote from within” philosophy and growth strategies 

​ 

management structure 

our company knows the value of a tenured team which is why our philosophy is to “promote from within” first as management opportunities arise we look first within the company and promote those who have performed well have the right expertise and have shown leadership potential before looking outside the company however we augment this philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience when appropriate this comprehensive approach increases team member commitment and has resulted in a very experienced leadership team as of december 31 2020 our strong management team was comprised of 216 senior managers who average 20 years of service 269 corporate managers who average 16 years of service and 560 district managers who average 13 years of service

​ 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 560 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores which provides our stores with strong operational support

​ 

store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a weeklong manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training field workshops regional meetings and our annual leadership conference

​ 

we provide financial incentives to all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability in 

​ 

addition each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store’s performance we believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel

​ 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers therefore our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from professional parts people particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business

​ 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase”

​ 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager these team members then spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development

​ 

team members and unions 

as of january 31 2021 we employed 77827 team members 62530 fulltime team members and 15297 parttime team members of whom 63212 were employed at our us stores 9593 were employed at our us dcs 3625 were employed at our us corporate and regional offices and 1397 were employed in mexico ours is an increasingly technical business creating the need for knowledgeable professional parts people and our ongoing focus on developing a technically proficient team has resulted in the growth of our fulltime work force increasing to 80 as of january 31 2021 up from 65 as of january 31 2020 while fulltime professional parts people play a vital role in our ongoing success the flexibility of incorporating parttime employment into our work force is also an important component of providing excellent customer service many of our parttime team members choose to work at o’reilly while attending school or during other transitional periods in their lives or simply because of their passion for cars and knowledge of auto parts parttime team members have the opportunity to become career professional parts people because of our promote from within philosophy and many of our leaders today began their careers as parttime team members in our stores or distribution centers 

​ 

a union represents team members in 53 stores 408 team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years approximately 63 team members that drive overtheroad trucks in two of our domestic dcs are also represented by a labor union in addition the company has collective bargaining agreements with two unions in mexico where the legal environment is very different and evolving compared to the us our relationships with unions in mexico will continue to evolve to ensure compliance with changing requirements we consider our current relationship with these unions and union team members to be excellent with the exception of the previously described team members our team members are not represented by labor unions 

​ 

store network 

​ 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are



​ 

 ​ 

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market

​ 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our us stores on average carry approximately 22000 skus and average approximately 7400 total square feet in size at december 31 2020 we had a total of approximately 42 million square feet in our 5594 domestic stores our domestic stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 159000 skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 362 hub stores which are comprised of 88 super hubs that average approximately 17100 square feet and carry an average of 70000 skus and 274 hubs that average approximately 10200 square feet and carry an average of 42000 skus

​ 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers

​ 

​ 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2020 and 2019

 ​ 

​ 

distribution systems 

​ 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our store stocked inventory moreover we believe our ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc network allow us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each dc as of december 31 2020 we had a total growth capacity of more than 585 stores in our distribution center network which benefited from relocating our nashville tennessee dc into a larger facility in lebanon tennessee providing a larger more efficient facility in march 2020 the existing store portion of the nashville tennessee dc facility remained a large hub that continues to provide same day parts availability in the attractive nashville market the distribution operations of our knoxville tennessee dc are in the process of being merged into our lebanon tennessee dc which is expected to be completed in 2021 and the existing store portion of our knoxville tennessee dc facility will remain a large hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the knoxville market additionally we plan to merge our north little rock arkansas dc into our new horn lake mississippi dc which we expect to open in mid2021 at that time the existing store portion of our north little rock arkansas dc facility will remain a large hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the little rock market 

​ 

distribution centers 

as of december 31 2020 we operated 28 domestic dcs comprised of approximately 116 million operating square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for more information about dc operating square footages our dcs stock an average of 159000 skus and most dcs are linked to and have access to multiple other regional dcs’ inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to substantially all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within an individual dc’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the dc’s “city counter” many of which receive this service seven days per week our dcs provide weekend service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic hub locations which redistribute products to surrounding stores our national hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores

​ 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2021 we plan to

 ​ 

hub stores

​

​ 

our “better” and “best” proprietary brands offer options for our more heavyduty diy customers as well as our professional service provider customers who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses

​ 

we have no longterm contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers we have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good

​ 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 730 suppliers the five largest of which accounted for approximately 25 of our total purchases in 2020 our largest supplier in 2020 accounted for approximately 7 of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3 to 6 of our total purchases

​ 

marketing 

​ 

retail and online marketing 

our integrated marketing strategy and omnichannel efforts include national media channels instore digital and social media activation as well as marketing the o’reilly brand through automotive event sponsorships and onsite appearances throughout the country our o’rewards loyalty program encourages repeat customers as they accumulate points from their o’reilly purchases that are redeemable for rewards at various purchase levels our marketing efforts also target the spanishspeaking market through broadcast media print and sports marketing as well as sponsorships of local and regional events

​ 

professional marketing 

to develop our continued relationships with professional service providers and installers we employ territory sales managers in nearly every market to ensure complete sales territory coverage and personalized service for these customers flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are distributed on a regular basis to all professional service providers including paint and body shops and fleet maintenance customers to encourage brand and program awareness in addition our professional customer program first call also offers an ordering website wwwfirstcallonlinecom  dedicated to professional service specialists in stores multiple daily deliveries and access to training opportunities shop management maintenance supplies and the certified auto repair program which offers professional service providers with the business tools they need to profitably grow and market their business 

​ 

industry environment 

​ 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 281 billion according to the auto care association this market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales we estimate that o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately 90 billion to 100 billion which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and diy sales at retail we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations

​ 

competition 

​ 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with

 ​ 

​ 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout continually enhancing the omnichannel experience and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket

​ 

inflation and seasonality 

​ 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation

​ 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

​ 

regulations 

​ 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business as well as the health and safety of our team members and customers including but not limited to those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property

​ 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our used oil oil filter and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty suppliers the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into supplierprovided containers and pallets and then recycled by the thirdparty suppliers in general our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the supplier

​

 item 1a risk factors 

​ 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements

​ 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

​ 

the ongoing occurrence of covid19 or any other such widespread public health crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic and its global spread including in the us has had a significant impact on the us and world economies the public health concerns resulting from the pandemic have created significant uncertainty economic disruption and volatility all of which have impacted and may continue to impact our business we may be required to take significant actions to mitigate any adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic including but not limited to reduced staffing and increased expenses we are unable to predict the ongoing shortterm and longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows due to several factors beyond our control including but not limited to

 ​ 

​ 

the above factors and uncertainties in addition to others we are not currently aware of may result in adverse impacts to our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

risks specific to our business and industry 

​ 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending such as a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us changes in vehicle technology used by the original equipment manufacturers “oem” on future vehicles including but not limited to electric hybrid and internal combustion engines may result in less frequent repairs parts lasting longer or elimination of certain repairs in addition restrictions on access to telematics diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the oems or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities furthermore the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions the cause of which could include a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortments between us and a range of competitors which could result in pricing pressure some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional instore experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust regional distribution footprint which could also create pricing pressure we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

​ 

a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them in addition the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them changes in us trade policies practices tariffs or taxes could affect our ability and our suppliers’ ability to source product at current volumes andor prices

​ 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours stability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

failure to protect our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our reputation is based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities negative publicity involving the company our merchandise or our industry in general that erode customer trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and business failure to comply with ethical social product labor health and safety accounting or environmental standards or existing or future laws or regulations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions from consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies which could require us to incur substantial legal fees and costs in addition negative claims or publicity including the availability of information and opinions on social media as its impact is immediate could adversely affect our reputation the opportunity for the rapid dissemination of information including inaccurate and inflammatory information and opinions is virtually limitless and easily accessible damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

​ 

risks associated with international operations could result in additional costs and inefficiencies 

in addition to many of the risks we face in our us operations international operations present a unique set of risks and challenges including local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions our ability to operate effectively and grow in international markets could be impacted by these risks resulting in legal liabilities additional costs and the distraction of management’s attention compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and protection of intellectual property rights surrounding items such as tradenames and trademarks in foreign jurisdictions can pose significant challenges

​ 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries given that our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance

​ 

​ 

risks related to our common stock 

​ 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer

​ 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions and potentially being targeted through the selling and buying of our common stock by a group of individuals whose interests and reasoning behind such actions may not align with an average market participant the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations and failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

​ 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such companies if similar litigation were initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business

​ 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing 

​ 

our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things

 ​ 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

​ 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs 

credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our unsecured senior notes preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flows

​ 

​ 

general risks 

​ 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2021 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following

 ​ 

we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we or the subsequent owner or operator may be liable

​ 

a breach of customer supplier team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of information about our customers suppliers team members and the company some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however these security measures may be breached due to cyberattacks team member error system compromises fraud hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales litigation or possible regulatory action in addition the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations and employment legislation and regulations may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

​ 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices

​ 

our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment legislation andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

 item 2 properties 

​ 

stores distribution centers and other properties 

of the 5616 stores we operated at december 31 2020 2325 stores were owned 3220 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties 22 of which were located in mexico and 71 stores were leased from entities that include one or more of our affiliated directors or members of their immediate family leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with two of the five affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from june 30 2021 to november 1 2035 we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties

​ 

the following table provides information regarding our us domestic regional dcs in operation as of december 31 2020

 

 ​ 

in addition we operate six small distribution centers in mexico these distribution centers do not serve us stores and are immaterial in the aggregate in 2020 we relocated our nashville tennessee dc into a larger facility in lebanon tennessee providing a larger more efficient facility that serves both markets in march 2020 the existing store portion of the nashville tennessee dc facility remained a large hub that continues to provide same day parts availability in the attractive nashville market the distribution operations of our knoxville tennessee dc are in the process of being merged into our lebanon tennessee dc which is expected to be completed in 2021 and the existing store portion of our knoxville tennessee dc facility will remain a large hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the knoxville market additionally we plan to merge our north little rock arkansas dc into our new horn lake mississippi dc which we expect to open in mid2021 at that time the existing store portion of our north little rock arkansas dc facility will remain a large hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the little rock market 

​ 

we believe that our present facilities are in good condition are sufficiently insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations the store servicing capability of our 28 existing us dcs is approximately 6180 stores providing a growth capacity of more than 585 us stores which will increase by approximately 150 net stores with the completion of our horn lake mississippi dc and the conversion of our north little rock arkansas dc into a hub facility in 2021 we believe the growth capacity in our dcs along with the additional capacity of our new horn lake mississippi dc will provide us with the dc infrastructure needed for nearterm expansion however as we expand our geographic footprint we will continue to evaluate our existing distribution system infrastructure and will adjust our distribution system capacity as needed to support our future growth

​ 

our corporate office operations occur primarily in springfield missouri and as of december 31 2020 the total square footage was 06 million square feet substantially all of which was owned

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

in management’s discussion and analysis we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results including

 ​ 

the review of management’s discussion and analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements related notes and other financial information forwardlooking statements and other risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report 

​ 

overview 

​ 

we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states and mexico we are one of the largest us automotive aftermarket specialty retailers selling our products to both diy customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy” our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment 

​ 

our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects “good” “better” and “best” alternatives our sales and total gross profit dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry we have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum

​ 

our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers including used oil oil filter and battery recycling battery wiper and bulb replacement battery diagnostic testing electrical and module testing check engine light code extraction loaner tool program drum and rotor resurfacing custom hydraulic hoses and professional paint shop mixing and related materials as of december 31 2020 we operated 5594 stores in 47 us states and 22 stores in mexico

​ 

we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and our consumers including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment trends interest rates and other economic factors due to the nature of these macroeconomic factors we are unable to determine how long current conditions will persist and the degree of impact future changes may have on our business macroeconomic factors such as increases in the us unemployment rate and demand drivers specific to the automotive aftermarket such as us miles driven have been pressured as a result of responses to the covid19 pandemic such as stay at home orders work from home arrangements and reduced travel gradual reopening processes across many markets positively impacted our performance beginning in the second quarter and continuing into our third and fourth quarters however we are unable to predict the ongoing and future impact of the pandemic on broader economic conditions or our industry

​ 

we believe the key drivers of current and future longterm demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age

​ 

number of miles driven 

the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket in total vehicles in the us are driven approximately three trillion miles per year resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation according to the department of transportation the number of total miles driven in the us increased 09 and 04 in 2019 and 2018 respectively and through february of 2020 yeartodate miles driven increased 21 miles driven dramatically declined beginning in march of 2020 and through december 2020 yeartodate miles driven decreased 132 as a result of the measures taken by state and local 

​ 

governments in response to covid19 and the impact to economic activity as consumers responded to covid19 further government measures or consumer and business behavior could continue to have a negative impact on miles driven but we are unable to predict the duration and severity of the impact to our business

​ 

size and age of the vehicle fleet 

the total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry as reported by the auto care association the total number of registered vehicles increased 104 from 2009 to 2019 bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 278 million by the end of 2019 for the year ended december 31 2020 the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the us “saar” was approximately 163 million in the past decade vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable ranging from 41 to 57 annually as a result over the past decade the average age of the us vehicle population has increased growing 180 from 100 years in 2009 to 118 years in 2019

​ 

we believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains interiors and exteriors and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these highermileage better built vehicles as the average age of vehicles on the road increases a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty these outofwarranty older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles we believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable higherquality highermileage vehicles and these investments along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products

​ 

we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service 

​ 

key events and recent developments 

​ 

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below

​ 

after the close of business on november 29 2019 we completed the acquisition of mayasa a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts headquartered in guadalajara jalisco mexico pursuant to a stock purchase agreement at the time of the acquisition mayasa operated six distribution centers 21 orma autopartes stores and served over 2000 independent jobber locations in 28 mexican states the results of mayasa’s operations have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements and results of operations beginning from the date of acquisition 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the economy placing pressure on our business beginning in midmarch 2020 as stay at home orders andor business restrictions were put in place in most cities counties and states this pressure continued until midapril when our customers began to receive economic impact payments under the cares act we believe these government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits along with the easing of stay at home orders and the associated market reopenings beginning in may and june and favorable industry dynamics such as consumers investing in existing vehicles led to strong demand for our products beginning in april and continuing through the remainder of 2020 

​ 

we have been deemed an essential service provider in the communities we serve and have taken many steps to promote the health and safety of our customers and team members while keeping our stores open and operating to meet our customers’ critical needs during the covid19 crisis in addition when our business was pressured at the end of the first quarter we took steps to strengthen our liquidity and mitigate the expected ongoing impact on our operations and financial performance

​ 

these actions include but are not limited to



​ 

 ​ 

while we continue to make adjustments as we navigate the current environment we are unable to predict how long the current crisis will last or the extent of the impact on our customers and our business 

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales which is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals due to rounding differences for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

 ​ 

2020 compared to 2019 

​ 

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 145 billion or 14 to 1160 billion from 1015 billion for the same period in 2019 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 109 and 40 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on changes in sales for us domestic stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members as well as sales from leap day in the year ended december 31 2020 online sales resulting from shiptohome orders and pickup instore orders for stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation

​ 

​ 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2020 in millions

 ​ 

we believe the increased sales are the result of store growth the acquisition of mayasa sales from one additional day due to leap day for the year ended december 31 2020 the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers the company incurred significant sales headwinds beginning in the middle of march and through the middle of april as a result of covid19 however the government stimulus payments enhanced unemployment benefits easing of stay at home orders and the associated market reopenings beginning in may and june when combined with favorable industry dynamics such as consumers investing in existing vehicles led to strong demand for our products over the remainder of the second quarter and continuing through the remainder of 2020

​ 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2020 was driven by increases in average ticket and transaction counts for both diy and professional service provider customers beginning in april of 2020 average ticket values primarily for diy customers benefited from consumers spending additional time and money repairing and maintaining their vehicles in response to the covid19 and economic environment in addition the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of betterengineered and more technically advanced vehicles these betterengineered more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time this decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts however when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which is a benefit to average ticket values average ticket values also benefited from increased selling prices on a skubysku basis as compared to the same period in 2019 driven by increases in acquisition cost of inventory which were passed on in market prices 

​ 

as the covid19 stay at home orders and business restrictions took effect in our markets in the middle of march 2020 transaction counts for both diy and professional service provider customers turned sharply negative with a larger impact realized on the professional side of the business as we believe a larger segment of the demographic served by our professional service provider customers is more likely to accommodate working from home than a typical diy customer however in the middle of april 2020 as the government stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits reached consumers we saw a reversal in transaction counts with a more immediate impact realized on the diy side of the business improved transaction counts continued through december 2020 as states implemented reopening plans and many individuals returned to work we cannot predict what continued impact the covid19 pandemic will have to our business in the future given the high degree of uncertainty as to the duration and severity of the pandemic the potential future changes to economic reopening plans and the mitigating impact of government stimulus for consumers

​ 

we opened 155 net new us stores and one new store in mexico during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to opening 200 net new us stores during the year ended december 31 2019 in addition on january 1 2019 we began operating 33 acquired bennett stores and during the year ended december 31 2019 we merged 13 of these acquired bennett stores into existing o’reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 bennett stores as o’reilly stores after the close of business on november 29 2019 we acquired 21 stores from mayasa as of december 31 2020 we operated 5594 stores in 47 us states and 22 stores in mexico compared to 5439 us stores in 47 states and 21 stores in mexico at december 31 2019 we anticipate new store growth will be 165 to 175 net new store openings in 2021

​ 

​ 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 13 to 609 billion or 524 of sales from 539 billion or 531 of sales for the same period in 2019 the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily the result of sales from new stores the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores sales from the acquired mayasa stores and one additional day due to leap day the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 was due to the comparable period in the prior year receiving a benefit from selling through inventory purchased prior to tariff related industrywide acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases and the lower gross margin sales from the acquired mayasa stores due to their large independent jobber customer base partially offset by a greater percentage of total sales generated from diy customers which carry a higher gross margin than professional service provider sales and acquisition cost reductions we determine inventory cost using the lastin firstout “lifo” method but have over time seen our lifo reserve balance exhausted as a result of cumulative historical acquisition cost decreases our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 6 to 367 billion or 316 of sales from 347 billion or 342 of sales for the same period in 2019 the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2020 was the result of facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count expense from the acquired mayasa stores and one additional day due to leap day the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 was principally due to leverage of store operating costs on strong comparable store sales growth combined with our cautionary approach and strict expense control measures in response to the onset of the covid19 environment

​ 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 26 to 242 billion or 208 of sales from 192 billion or 189 of sales for the same period in 2019

​ 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 17 to 153 million or 13 of sales from 130 million or 13 of sales for the same period in 2019 the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2020 was the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings 

​ 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 29 to 514 million 227 effective tax rate from 399 million 223 effective tax rate for the same period in 2019 the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2020 was the result of higher taxable income and lower excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation partially offset by a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments in 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 was the result of the lower excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation partially offset by a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments in 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 

​ 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 26 to 175 billion or 151 of sales from 139 billion or 137 of sales for the same period in 2019

​ 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 32 to 2353 on 74 million shares from 1788 on 78 million shares for the same period in 2019

​ 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility 

​ 

as we operated amid uncertainty and disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic we have demonstrated our ability to take prudent steps to support the future stability and financial flexibility of our company at the onset of disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic our teams took decisive action to reduce costs and conserve cash which included delaying capital investments reducing operating costs and temporarily suspending our share repurchase program from march 16 2020 through may 28 2020 as we are unable to determine the duration or potential increase in severity of this crisis we cannot predict its future impacts on our ability to generate funds from operations or maintain liquidity and accordingly we will continue to make adjustments as we navigate the current and expected environment

​ 

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2020 and 2019 dollars in millions

 

 ​ 

current assets increased 17 current liabilities increased 18 total debt increased 6 and total equity decreased 65 from 2019 to 2020 the increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in cash resulting from our strong sales in 2020 and inventory resulting from our distribution expansion projects and the opening of 156 net new stores in 2020 the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable which was the result of higher inventory turns on strong sales and accrued benefits and withholdings which was the result of deferred payroll tax payments under the cares act and team member incentive payments our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1145 as of december 31 2020 as compared to 1044 for the same period in 2019 the increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of 500 million of 4200 senior notes due 2030 and 500 million of 1750 senior notes due 2031 partially offset by the redemption of 500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4875 senior notes due 2021 and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility at december 31 2020 the decrease in total equity was due to an increase in retained deficit resulting from a greater impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program partially offset by net income for the year ended december 31 2020 

​ 

​ 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in thousands

 

 ​ 

cash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the us were 115 million and 57 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in mexico

​ 

operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in net inventory investment a larger increase in net income an increase in income taxes payable and an increase in accrued benefits and withholdings the larger decrease in net inventory investment in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to the strong comparable store sales growth and the resulting benefit to inventory turns the increase in income taxes payable in 2020 compared to the decrease in income taxes payable in 2019 was primarily the result of the realization of credits from renewable energy tax credit investments and an income taxes payable position at the end of 2020 versus a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2019 the increase in accrued benefits and withholdings is primarily due to the deferral of payroll tax payments under the cares act and the timing of team member incentive payments 

​ 

investing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures and a decrease in other investing activities partially offset by an increase in investments in tax credit equity investments total capital expenditures were 466 million in 2020 versus 628 million in 2019 and the decrease was primarily related to lower new store project development spending in 2020 as compared to 2019 and the level of distribution expansion projects in 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease in other investment activities was due to the acquisition of mayasa in 2019 the increase in investments in tax credit equity investments was the result of entering into more renewable energy tax credit investments in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits

​ 

we opened 156 and 200 net new stores in 2020 and 2019 respectively in addition on january 1 2019 we began operating 33 acquired bennett stores and during the year ended december 31 2019 we merged 13 of these acquired bennett stores into existing o’reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 bennett stores as o’reilly stores after the close of business on november 29 2019 we acquired 21 stores from mayasa we plan to open 165 to 175 net new stores in 2021 the current costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition building improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 15 million to 18 million however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site

​ 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in repurchases of our common stock during 2020 compared to 2019 the redemption of 500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4875 senior notes due 2021 and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility at december 31 2020 partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in 2020 compared to 2019

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other longterm liabilities which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 6 “leases” note 13 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” and note 14 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility

​ 

deferred income taxes as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2021 which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets

​ 

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 16 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2020 we recorded a net liability of 359 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included in “other liabilities”

​ 

​ 

we record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is fully disclosed in note 13 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements this estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined as of december 31 2020 we recorded a liability of 404 million related to this uncertain liability on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included in “other liabilities”

​ 

the following table identifies the estimated payments of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 in thousands

 

 ​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we historically utilized various offbalance sheet financial instruments including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into any such transactions for over 10 years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans

​ 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million sublimit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 664 million and 389 million were outstanding at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively

​ 

we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

​ 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

​ 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial 

​ 

statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material

​ 

supplier concessions 

we receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements including cooperative advertising allowances for warranties merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates cooperative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred all other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations based on our historical results and current assessment we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations the eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material

​ 

valuation of longlived assets 

we evaluate the carrying value of finite and indefinite longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values as a component of the finite longlived assets evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets as a component of the indefinite longlived assets evaluation we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events or circumstances that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset have occurred as well as if they continue to support an indefinite useful life areas evaluated include changes in cost factors such as raw materials or labor financial performance including declining revenues or cash flows the legal regulatory and political environment and other industry and market considerations including the competitive environment and changes in product demand if events or market conditions exist that would more likely than not indicate that impairment may be necessary a detailed quantitative assessment would be performed based on our qualitative assessment we do not believe there has been a change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a calculation of fair value of indefinite longlived assets is required as of december 31 2020 our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting longterm estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact our impairment assessment 

​ 

selfinsurance reserves 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability property loss and team member health care benefits with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities employment related claims and litigation certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability or property loss claim when estimating our selfinsurance liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience and trendlines projected medical and legal inflation growth patterns and exposure forecasts the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations our calculation of selfinsurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates which may result in material losses or gains as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods we adjust our selfinsurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities if selfinsurance reserves were changed 10 from our estimated reserves at december 31 2020 the financial impact would have been approximately 20 million or 09 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2020 

​ 

​ 

inflation and seasonality 

​ 

we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations

​ 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” with variable interest rates based on either an alternative base rate or adjusted libo rate as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility

​ 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 42 billion and 37 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at 46 billion and 39 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively which was determined by reference to quoted market prices

​ 

cash equivalents risk 

we invest certain of our excess cash balances in shortterm highlyliquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal as of december 31 2020 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 4656 million

​ 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies our foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars

​ 

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 1492 million at december 31 2020 the year ended december 31 2020 exchange rates of the mexican peso with respect to the us dollar decreased by approximately 5 from december 31 2019 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10 change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2020 would be approximately 136 million any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed a 10 change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations

​

​

our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers such as

 ​ 

see the “risk factors” section of this annual report on form 10k for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others deteriorating economic conditions competition in the automotive aftermarket business our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions future growth assurance our dependence upon key and other personnel our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products our acquisition strategies complications in our distribution centers “dcs” failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock our increased debt levels a downgrade in our credit ratings data security environmental legislation and other regulations and risks associated with international operations

​ 

our business 

​ 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values including superior customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both diy and professional service provider customers

​ 

​ 

competitive advantages 

​ 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated

​ 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

for more than 40 years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers

​ 

in 2019 we derived approximately 56 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 44 of our sales from our professional service provider customers historically we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business due to our systems knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket supported by our approximately 825 fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets

​ 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs accordingly each o’reilly store carries or has same or next day availability to a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell

​ 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below

 ​ 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard part repairs in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people

​ 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional 

​ 

tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 28 regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 159000 stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust distribution network we operate a total of 356 hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 68000 skus from a super hub or 42000 skus from a hub to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business

​ 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of 216 senior managers who average 21 years of service 270 corporate managers who average 16 years of service and 540 district managers who average 14 years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 27 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993

​ 

growth strategy 

​ 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2019 we opened 200 net new domestic stores as well as 20 net additional stores from the bennett auto supply “bennett” inc acquisition and 21 additional stores from the mayasa acquisition in 2020 we plan to open approximately 180 net new stores which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores by

 ​ 

new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts vehicles in operation number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius

​ 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have and continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy

​ 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability

​ 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains like o’reilly to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets

​ 

​ 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features optimized square footage high ceilings convenient interior store layouts instore signage bright lighting convenient ingress egress and parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 2019 we relocated 12 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 1500 additional stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers

​ 

omnichannel growth strategy 

our omnichannel growth strategies reflect the continued evolution of customer preferences in researching and completing purchases more than ever before our customers’ purchase decisions are informed by a range of interactions whether inperson over the phone or through a variety of digital channels as they seek to find the professional parts knowledge and the product availability they need to meet their automotive repair and maintenance needs our omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering our customers an enhanced and seamless research and buying experience through any of these channels we have long been known for excellent customer service and continue to grow the functionality and userfriendliness of our websites including wwworeillyautocom and wwwfirstcallonlinecom  to enhance our customer’s shopping experience many of our customers interact over multiple channels to research and complete a purchase and the functionality and features of our digital sites complements the outstanding customer service provided in our over 5400 brick and mortar locations

​ 

team members 

​ 

as of january 31 2020 we employed 82167 team members 53159 fulltime team members and 29008 parttime team members of whom 68679 were employed at our us stores 8607 were employed at our us dcs 3620 were employed at our us corporate and regional offices and 1261 were employed in mexico a union represents 50 stores 489 team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years and approximately 34 team members who drive overtheroad trucks in two of our domestic dcs are represented by labor unions as well in addition the company assumed collective bargaining agreements with various unions in mexico in connection with its acquisition of mayasa however none of the company’s team members are specifically affiliated with or members of those unions with the exception of the previously described team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition for 63 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of each team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and respect has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent

​ 

store network 

​ 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are

 ​ 

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to 

​ 

improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market

​ 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our us stores on average carry approximately 22000 skus and average approximately 7400 total square feet in size at december 31 2019 we had a total of approximately 40 million square feet in our 5439 domestic stores our domestic stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 159000 skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 356 hub stores which are comprised of 85 super hubs that average approximately 15700 square feet and carry an average of 68000 skus and 271 hubs that average approximately 10000 square feet and carry an average of 42000 skus

​ 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers

​ 

​ 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2019 and 2018

 ​ 

​ 

management structure 

​ 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 540 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores which provides our stores with strong operational support

​

we provide financial incentives to all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability in addition each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store’s performance we believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel

​ 

professional parts people 

​ 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers therefore our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from professional parts people particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business

​ 

distribution systems 

​ 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory moreover we believe our ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc network allow us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each dc as of december 31 2019 we had a total growth capacity of more than 695 stores in our distribution center network further enhancing our distribution capabilities in 2020 we plan to relocate and merge our existing nashville tennessee and knoxville tennessee dcs into a larger facility located in lebanon tennessee providing a larger more efficient facility to serve both markets while also allowing us to convert the existing knoxville tennessee dc into a large hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the attractive knoxville market additionally we plan to open a new dc in horn lake mississippi in 2020

​

​ 

our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within an individual dc’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the dc’s “city counter” many of which receive this service seven days per week our dcs provide weekend service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic hub locations which redistribute products to surrounding stores our national hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores

​ 

we have no longterm contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers we have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good

​ 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 735 suppliers the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24 of our total purchases in 2019 our largest supplier in 2019 accounted for approximately 7 of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3 to 6 of our total purchases

industry environment 

​ 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 297 billion according to the auto care association this market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales we estimate that o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately 90 billion to 100 billion which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and diy sales at retail we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations

​ 

competition 

​ 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with

 ​ 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout continually enhancing the omnichannel experience and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket

​ 

inflation and seasonality 

​ 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation

​ 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

​ 

regulations 

​ 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including but not limited to those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property

 item 1a risk factors 

​ 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could 

​ 

have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements

​ 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending such as a prolong public health crisis or epidemic such as the coronavirus many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty in addition restrictions on access to telematics diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities furthermore the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions the cause of which could include a prolonged public health crisis or epidemic such as the coronavirus and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortments between us and a range of competitors which could result in pricing pressure some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional instore experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust regional distribution footprint which could also create pricing pressure we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

​ 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2020 and beyond will be achieved failure 

​ 

to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k

​ 

a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them in addition the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes a prolonged public health crisis or epidemic such as the coronavirus or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them changes in us trade policies practices tariffs or taxes could affect our ability and our suppliers’ ability to source product at current volumes andor prices

​ 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following

 ​ 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

​ 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members

​ 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer

​ 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations and failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

​ 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such companies if similar litigation were initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business

​ 

our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things

 ​ 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

​ 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs 

credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our unsecured senior notes preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our 

​ 

supplier financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flows

​ 

a breach of customer supplier team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of information about our customers suppliers team members and the company some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however these security measures may be breached due to cyberattacks team member error system compromises fraud hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales litigation or possible regulatory action in addition the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations and employment legislation and regulations may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices

​ 

our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment legislation andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

risks associated with international operations could result in additional costs and inefficiencies 

in addition to many of the risks we face in our us operations international operations present a unique set of risks and challenges including local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions our ability to operate effectively and grow in international markets could be impacted by these risks resulting in legal liabilities additional costs and the distraction of management’s attention compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and protection of intellectual property rights surrounding items such as tradenames and trademarks in foreign jurisdictions can pose significant challenges

​ 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries given that our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance

stores distribution centers and other properties 

of the 5460 stores that we operated at december 31 2019 2235 stores were owned 3151 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties 21 of which were located in mexico and 74 stores were leased from entities that include one or more of our affiliated directors or members of their immediate family leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our 

​ 

option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with two of the seven affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from july 31 2020 to september 30 2031 we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties

​ 

the following table provides information regarding our us domestic regional dcs in operation as of december 31 2019

​ 

overview 

​ 

we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states we are one of the largest us automotive aftermarket specialty retailers selling our products to both diy customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy” our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment 

​ 

our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects “good” “better” and “best” alternatives our sales and total gross profit dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry we have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum

​ 

our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers including used oil oil filter and battery recycling battery wiper and bulb replacement battery diagnostic testing electrical and module testing check engine light code extraction loaner tool program drum and rotor resurfacing custom hydraulic hoses professional paint shop mixing and related materials and machine shops as of december 31 2019 we operated 5439 stores in 47 us states and 21 stores in mexico

​ 

we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that influence both our industry and our consumers including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment trends interest rates and other economic factors due to the nature of these macroeconomic 

​ 

factors we are unable to determine how long current conditions will persist and the degree of impact future changes may have on our business 

​ 

the sustained trends of low us unemployment have been favorable to our industry through the support of miles driven and consumer confidence however this has also resulted in pressure on wages particularly when combined with legislated wage increases in certain market areas

​ 

we believe the key drivers of current and future longterm demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age

​ 

number of miles driven 

the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket in total vehicles in the us are driven approximately three trillion miles per year resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation according to the department of transportation the number of total miles driven in the us increased 04 and 12 in 2018 and 2017 respectively and through november of 2019 yeartodate miles driven increased 09 we would expect to continue to see modest improvements in total miles driven in the us supported by an increasing number of registered vehicles on the road resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products

​ 

size and age of the vehicle fleet 

the total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry as reported by the auto care association the total number of registered vehicles increased 81 from 2008 to 2018 bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 272 million by the end of 2018 for the year ended december 31 2019 the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the us “saar” was approximately 167 million contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road in the past decade vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable ranging from 44 to 57 annually as a result over the past decade the average age of the us vehicle population has increased growing 206 from 97 years in 2008 to 117 years in 2018 

​ 

we believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains interiors and exteriors and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these highermileage better built vehicles as the average age of vehicles on the road increases a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty these outofwarranty older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles we believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable higherquality highermileage vehicles and these investments along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products

​ 

we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service

​ 

key events and recent developments 

​ 

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below



​ 

 ​ 

results of operations 

​ 

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017

 

 ​ 

2019 compared to 2018 

​ 

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 614 million or 6 to 1015 billion from 954 billion for the same period in 2018 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 40 and 38 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively us domestic comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members online sales resulting from shiptohome orders and pickup instore orders for stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation

​ 

​ 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2019 in millions

 ​ 

we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broad selection of product offerings in most of our stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers

​ 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2019 was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both diy and professional service provider customers transaction counts were flat for the year ended december 31 2019 comprised of positive transaction counts for professional service provider customers offset by negative transaction counts for diy customers the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the newer population of vehicles and increased selling prices on a samesku basis as compared to one year ago the increased complexity and replacement costs are a result of the current population of betterengineered and more technically advanced vehicles that require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time which creates pressure on customer transaction counts however when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which benefits average ticket values the increase in selling prices on a samesku basis was driven by increases in acquisition costs of inventory which were passed through in market prices transaction counts for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 were also negatively impacted by wetter cooler than normal temperatures in many of our markets during the first half of 2019 which is a headwind to diy business diy transaction counts continue to be impacted by the inflationary environment

​ 

we opened 200 net new us stores during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to opening 200 net new us stores during the year ended december 31 2018 in addition on january 1 2019 we began operating 33 acquired bennett stores and during the year ended december 31 2019 we merged 13 of these acquired bennett stores into existing o’reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 bennett stores as o’reilly stores after the close of business on november 29 2019 we acquired 21 stores from mayasa as of december 31 2019 we operated 5439 stores in 47 us states and 21 stores in mexico compared to 5219 us stores in 47 states at december 31 2018 we anticipate us new store growth will be approximately 180 net new store openings in 2020

​ 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 7 to 539 billion or 531 of sales from 504 billion or 528 of sales for the same period in 2018 the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily the result of sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2019 was due to a benefit from selling through inventory purchased prior to recent industrywide acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases beginning in the last six months of 2018 inventory acquisition costs in our industry increased as a result of tariffs on products imported from china and other increases in supplier input costs which were passed through in higher retail and wholesale prices in our industry we determine inventory cost using the lastin firstout “lifo” method but have over time seen our lifo reserve balance exhausted as a result of cumulative historical acquisition cost decreases our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost

​ 

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 8 to 347 billion or 342 of sales from 322 billion or 338 of sales for the same period in 2018 the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2019 was the result of team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count the increase in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2019 was principally due to wage pressure driven by a low unemployment inflationary environment and other variable costs including health benefit costs and cost of insurance primarily auto related and increased spending on omnichannel and technology initiatives

​ 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 6 to 192 billion or 189 of sales from 182 billion or 190 of sales for the same period in 2018

​ 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 8 to 130 million or 13 of sales from 121 million or 13 of sales for the same period in 2018 the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities

​ 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 8 to 399 million 223 effective tax rate from 370 million 218 effective tax rate for the same period in 2018 the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2019 was the result of higher taxable income and lower excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was the result of lower excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation were approximately 26 million and 35 million respectively

​ 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 5 to 139 billion or 137 of sales from 132 billion or 139 of sales for the same period in 2018

​ 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 11 to 1788 on 78 million shares from 1610 on 82 million shares for the same period in 2018 

​ 

2018 compared to 2017 

​ 

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 559 million or 6 to 954 billion from 898 billion for the same period in 2017 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 38 and 14 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members online sales resulting from shiptohome orders and pickup instore orders for stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation

​ 

​ 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2018 in millions

 ​ 

we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broad selection of product offerings with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers

​ 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2018 was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both diy and professional service provider customers and positive transaction counts for professional service provider customers offset by negative transaction counts for diy customers the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of betterengineered and more technically advanced vehicles and same sku inflation these betterengineered more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time this decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts however when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which is a benefit to average ticket values during the year ended december 31 2018 diy transaction counts also continued to be pressured by increased gas prices and other inflationary impacts resulting in an increased deferral of vehicle maintenance and repairs over the short term

​ 

we opened 200 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2018 compared to opening 190 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2017 as of december 31 2018 we operated 5219 stores in 47 states compared to 5019 stores in 47 states at december 31 2017 after the close of business on december 31 2018 we acquired the 33 bennett stores that were not included in our 2018 store count and were not operated by the company in 2018 

​ 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 7 to 504 billion or 528 of sales from 472 billion or 526 of sales for the same period in 2017 the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily the result of sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to a noncash lifo charge in 2017 partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses the increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to wage pressure and increased transportation costs as compared to 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018 we did not realize net acquisition cost decreases and as a result we did not record a lifo charge during the year ended december 31 2017 our lifo costs were written down by approximately 22 million to reflect replacement cost

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 8 to 322 billion or 338 of sales from 300 billion or 334 of sales for the same period in 2017 the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count the planned allocation of a portion of the tax savings realized as a result of the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 the “tax act” and unfavorable comparison to a 2017 benefit of 91 million from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim the increase in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to our tax savings allocation initiatives and the 2017 legal accrual benefit

​ 

​ 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 5 to 182 billion or 190 of sales from 173 billion or 192 of sales for the same period in 2017

​ 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 38 to 121 million or 13 of sales from 88 million or 10 of sales for the same period in 2017 the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings

​ 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased 27 to 370 million 218 effective tax rate from 504 million 308 effective tax rate for the same period in 2017 the decreases in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 were primarily the result of the lower federal corporate tax rate set forth by the tax act partially offset by a 53 million benefit in 2017 from the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower federal corporate tax rate set forth by the tax act and lower excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation in 2018 as compared 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018 and 2017 excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation were approximately 35 million and 49 million respectively

​ 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 17 to 132 billion or 139 of sales from 113 billion or 126 of sales for the same period in 2017

​ 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 27 to 1610 on 82 million shares from 1267 on 90 million shares for the same period in 2017 due to the revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities in 2017 our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2017 included a onetime benefit of 059

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels

​ 

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2019 and 2018 dollars in millions

 

 ​ 

current assets increased 8 current liabilities increased 15 total debt increased 14 and total equity increased 12 from 2018 to 2019 the increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory resulting from our distribution expansion projects and the opening and acquiring of 241 net new stores in 2019 the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the adoption of 

​ 

asc 842 during 2019 resulting in the recognition of 316 million of current operating lease liabilities at december 31 2019 and an increase in accounts payable resulting from inventory growth related to distribution expansion projects and new store openings our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1044 as of december 31 2019 as compared to 1057 for the same period in 2018 the increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of 500 million of 3900 senior notes due 2029 and borrowings of 261 million on our revolving credit facility at december 31 2019 the increase in total equity was due to a decrease in retained deficit resulting from net income for the year ended december 31 2019 and increased additional paidincapital which was due to employee stock option exercises partially offset by the impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on retained deficit and additional paidin capital

cash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the us were 57 million as of december 31 2019 which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in mexico and no cash or cash equivalents were held outside of the us as of december 31 2018 and 2017

​ 

operating activities 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in income taxes payable a larger increase in net inventory investment and an increase in accounts receivable primarily offset by increased operating income the decrease from income taxes payable in 2019 compared to the increase in income taxes payable in 2018 was primarily the result of a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2019 versus an income taxes payable position at the end of 2018 the increase in net inventory investment was the result of a larger increase in inventory in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by our distribution expansion projects the increase in accounts receivable during 2019 as compared to the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to the respective yearoveryear business day timing of yearend

​ 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased operating income reduced cash taxes paid due to the tax act and a reduction of accounts receivable due to the business day timing of yearend 2018 as compared to 2017

​ 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures investments in tax credit equity investments and an increase in other investing activities total capital expenditures were 628 million in 2019 versus 504 million in 2018 and the increase was primarily related to distribution expansion projects the timing of property acquisitions and construction costs for new stores and technology investments during 2019 as compared to 2018 investments in tax credit equity investments were the result of entering into tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits the increase in other investing activities was due to the acquisition of mayasa in 2019 

​ 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2018 and an increase in other investing activities total capital expenditures were 504 million and 466 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions closings construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2018 as compared to 2017 the increase in other investing activities was primarily due to more acquisition related expenditures in 2018 as compared to 2017

​ 

​ 

we opened 200 200 and 190 net new domestic stores in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in addition on january 1 2019 we began operating 33 acquired bennett stores and during the year ended december 31 2019 we merged 13 of these acquired bennett stores into existing o’reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 bennett stores as o’reilly stores after the close of business on november 29 2019 we acquired 21 stores from mayasa we plan to open approximately 180 net new domestic stores in 2020 the current costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition building improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 15 million to 18 million however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site

​ 

financing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to a lower level of repurchases of our common stock in 2019 compared to 2018 and a higher level of net borrowings during 2019 as compared to 2018

​ 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to a lower level of net borrowings during 2018 as compared to 2017 partially offset by a lower level of repurchases of our common stock in 2018 as compared to 2017

​ 

unsecured revolving credit facility 

on april 5 2017 the company entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” the credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 120 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” arranged by jpmorgan chase bank na which is scheduled to mature in april 2022 the credit agreement includes a 200 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 75 million sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility the company may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 600 million provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed 180 billion at any time

​ 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we had outstanding letters of credit primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amounts of 39 million and 35 million respectively reducing the aggregate availability under the credit agreement by those amounts as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility in the amounts of 261 million and 287 million respectively

​

​ 

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes

​ 

the credit agreement contains certain covenants including limitations on indebtedness a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 250100 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 350100 the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense capitalized interest and rent expense the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense adjusted debt includes outstanding debt outstanding standby letters of credit and similar instruments fivetimes rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of longterm debt in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement certain actions may be taken including but not limited to possible termination of commitments immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the credit agreement and litigation from our lenders

​ 

​ 

we had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 521 times and 538 times as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively and a consolidated leverage ratio of 220 times and 210 times as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements

​ 

the table below outlines the calculation of free cash flow and reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 in thousands

 ​ 

​ 

free cash flow the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the tables above a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures

​ 

share repurchase program 

in january of 2011 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under the program we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices based on a variety of factors such as price corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions our board of directors may increase or otherwise modify renew suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice as announced on may 31 2019 and february 5 2020 our board of directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional 100 billion resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of 1375 billion each additional authorization is effective for a threeyear period beginning on its respective announcement date

​ 

the following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in thousands except per share data

 ​ 

as of december 31 2019 we had 569 million remaining under our share repurchase program subsequent to the end of the year and through february 28 2020 we repurchased an additional 09 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of 40078 for a total investment of 363 million we have repurchased a total of 771 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of 2011 and through february 28 2020 at an average price of 16272 for a total aggregate investment of 1254 billion as of february 28 2020 we had approximately 121 billion remaining under our share repurchase program

​ 

contractual obligations 

​ 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other longterm liabilities which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 5 “leases” note 11 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” and note 13 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility

​ 

deferred income taxes as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2020 which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets

​ 

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 15 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2019 we recorded a net liability of 366 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included in “other liabilities”

​ 

we record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is fully disclosed in note 11 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements this estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined as of 

​ 

december 31 2019 we recorded a liability of 32 million related to this uncertain liability on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included in “other liabilities”

​ 

the following table identifies the estimated payments of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 in thousands

 

 ​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we historically utilized various offbalance sheet financial instruments including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into any such transactions for over 10 years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans

​ 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million sublimit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 39 million and 35 million were outstanding at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

​ 

we have entered into an agreement to make capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits we are required to make capital contributions totaling 95 million upon achievement of project milestones by the solar energy farms the timing of which is variable and outside of the company’s control 

​ 

we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

​ 

​ 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

​ 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material

​ 

inventory obsolescence and shrink 

inventory which consists of automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and tools is stated at the lower of cost or market the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and accordingly have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of products is lower than our recorded cost this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate at a given point in time the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods ultimately our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future

​ 

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if the shrink reserve changed 10 from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2019 the financial impact would have been approximately less than 1 million or less than 01 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2019

​ 

valuation of longlived assets and goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values as part of the evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting longterm estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact our impairment assessment

​ 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have never recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves a detailed qualitative assessment to be performed first and then based on the conclusion of the totality of events and circumstances a quantitative assessment may be performed which involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach when a quantitative assessment is performed inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs based on our qualitative assessment we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 2019 nor do we believe goodwill would be at risk of failing impairment testing 

​ 

supplier concessions 

we receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements including cooperative advertising allowances for warranties merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates cooperative advertising allowances that are 

​ 

incremental to our advertising program specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred all other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations based on our historical results and current assessment we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations the eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material

​ 

warranty reserves 

we offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties the risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims for this merchandise when sold we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales estimated warranty costs which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims if warranty reserves were changed 10 from our estimated reserves at december 31 2019 the financial impact would have been approximately 6 million or 03 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2019

​ 

selfinsurance reserves 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability property loss and team member health care benefits with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities employment related claims and litigation certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability or property loss claim when estimating our selfinsurance liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience and trendlines projected medical and legal inflation growth patterns and exposure forecasts the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations our calculation of selfinsurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates which may result in material losses or gains as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods we adjust our selfinsurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value using a creditadjusted discount rate these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities if selfinsurance reserves were changed 10 from our estimated reserves at december 31 2019 the financial impact would have been approximately 16 million or 09 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2019

​ 

legal reserves 

we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which o’reilly is currently involved we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business management with the assistance of outside legal counsel must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures if legal reserves were changed 10 from our estimated reserves at december 31 2019 the financial impact would have been approximately 1 million or less than 01 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2019

​ 

taxes 

we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions andor changes in tax regulations in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax 

​ 

positions and actual results could differ from our estimates alternatively we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority

​ 

inflation and seasonality 

​ 

we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations

​ 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

​

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” with variable interest rates based on either an alternative base rate or adjusted libo rate as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019 we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the amount of 261 million at the weightedaverage variable interest rate of 3318 at this borrowing level a 025 increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable annual impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows in the amount of 07 million

​ 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 365 billion and 315 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at 388 billion and 312 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively which was determined by reference to quoted market prices

​ 

cash equivalents risk 

we invest certain of our excess cash balances in shortterm highlyliquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal as of december 31 2019 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 40 million

​ 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies our foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars

​ 

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 1519 million at december 31 2019 the yearend exchange rates of the mexican peso with respect to the us dollar increased by approximately 3 from the acquisition date of november 29 2019 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10 change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2019 would be approximately 138 million any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

​ 

a 10 change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations

 item 1 business 

general information 

o’reilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries collectively “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “o’reilly” is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself “diy” and professional service provider customers our “dual market strategy” the business was founded in 1957 by charles f o’reilly and his son charles h “chub’’ o’reilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri our common stock has traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “orly” since april 22 1993 

at december 31 2018  we operated 5219  stores in 47  states our stores carry an extensive product line including 

 

our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers such as 

 

see the “risk factors” section of item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others deteriorating economic conditions competition in the automotive aftermarket business our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions future growth assurance our dependence upon key and other personnel our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products our acquisition strategies complications in our distribution centers “dcs” failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock our increased debt levels a downgrade in our credit ratings data security and environmental legislation and other regulations 

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values including superior customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both diy and professional service provider customers 

competitive advantages 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

for more than 35  years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers 

in 2018  we derived approximately 57  of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 43  of our sales from our professional service provider customers historically we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business due to our systems knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket supported by our approximately 790  fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs accordingly each o’reilly store carries or has same or next day availability to a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below 

 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard part repairs in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 27  regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 156000  stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust distribution network we operate a total of 342  hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 66000  skus from a super hub or 42000  skus from a hub to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of 194  senior managers who average 20  years of service 254  corporate managers who average 16  years of service and 518  district managers who average 13  years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 26  consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2018  we opened 200  net new stores and in 2019 we plan to open approximately 200 to 210  net new stores which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores in addition after the close of business on december 31 2018 we acquired the 33  bennett auto supply inc stores that were not included in our 2018 store count and were not operated by the company in 2018 we typically open new stores by 

 

new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts vehicles in operation number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have and continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains like o’reilly to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features optimized square footage high ceilings convenient interior store layouts instore signage bright lighting convenient ingress egress and parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 2018  we relocated 18  stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 1000  additional stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

enhance and improve customer omnichannel experience 

regardless of how our customers begin their interaction whether instore over the telephone or digitally and complete their transaction whether instore or delivery to their home or business our goal is to provide excellent customer service and a seamless experience our userfriendly websites wwworeillyautocom  and wwwfirstcallonlinecom  allow our customers to search product and repair content check the instore availability of our products and place orders for either delivery or instore pickup we continue to improve the functionality of our websites to provide our customers with a userfriendly and convenient shopping experience as well as a robust product and repair content information resource which will continue to enhance the o’reilly brand 

team members 

as of january 31 2019  we employed 79174  team members  49476  fulltime team members and 29698  parttime team members of whom 67369  were employed at our stores 8372  were employed at our dcs and 3433  were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 48  stores  506  team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years in addition approximately 62  team members who drive overtheroad trucks in two  of our dcs are represented by labor unions except for these team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition for 62  years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of each team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and respect has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

store network 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are 



when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our stores on average carry approximately 23000  skus and average approximately 7400  total square feet in size at december 31 2018  we had a total of approximately 38 million  square feet in our 5219  stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 156000  skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 342  hub stores which are comprised of 84  super hubs that average approximately 15600  square feet and carry an average of 66000  skus and 258  hubs that average approximately 10000  square feet and carry an average of 42000  skus 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores’’ generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2018  and 2017  



store layout 

we utilize a computerassisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hardparts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of each particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation 

to enhance storelevel operations and provide consistently high levels of customer service we operate exclusive store automation systems that deliver quick pointofsale transaction processing times reduce our customers’ checkout time ensure accuracy and provide our professional parts people with immediate access to our proprietary electronic parts catalog part images technical schematics and pricing information based on each individual customer’s specific vehicle make model and year these systems track instore inventory availability and through connectivity with our dc and corporate systems allow realtime access to inventory available in nearby stores and dcs throughout our network our systems also capture detailed sales information which assists management in strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency and provide a mechanism to deliver ongoing team member training through our integrated digital learning platform 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 518  district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10  stores which provides our stores with a strong operational support 

store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a weeklong manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training field workshops regional meetings and our annual leadership conference 

we provide financial incentives to all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability in addition each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store’s performance we believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers therefore our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from professional parts people particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager these team members then spend at least one day 

per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

distribution systems 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory moreover we believe our ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc network allow us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each dc as of december 31 2018 we had a total growth capacity of more than 615  stores in our distribution center network which will increase by approximately 275  stores with the completion of our twinsburg ohio dc in 2019 further enhancing our distribution capabilities in 2020 we plan to relocate and merge our existing nashville tennessee and knoxville tennessee dcs into a larger facility located in lebanon tennessee providing a larger more efficient facility to serve both markets while also allowing us to convert the existing knoxville tennessee dc into a large hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the attractive knoxville market 

distribution centers 

as of december 31 2018  we operated 27  dcs comprised of approximately 108 million  operating square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for a detailed listing of dc operating square footages our dcs stock an average of 156000  skus and most dcs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional dcs’ inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within an individual dc’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the dc’s “city counter” many of which receive this service seven days per week our dcs provide weekend service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic hub locations which redistribute products to surrounding stores our national hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores with our planned dc expansion during 2019 we expect to end the year in 2019 operating 28  dcs comprised of approximately 112 million  operating square feet 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2019  we plan to 

 • continue to define and implement best practices in all dcs and 

 

hub stores 

we currently operate a total of 342  strategically located hub stores in addition to serving diy and professional service provider customers in their markets hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of skus on a sameday basis our hub store network consists of 84  super hubs that average approximately 15600  square feet and carry an average of 66000  skus and 258  hubs that average approximately 10000  square feet and carry an average of 42000  skus 

products and purchasing 

our stores offer diy and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco armor all bosch castrol dorman felpro gates rubber monroe moog pennzoil prestone quaker state standard stp turtle wax valvoline wagner and wix and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products which span the entire good better and best value spectrum under our besttest® brakebest® import direct® masterpro® microgard® murray® omnispark® o’reilly auto parts® precision® power torque® super start® and ultima® brands our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands which we have acquired or developed over time our “good” proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value a characteristic important to our diy customers while our “better” and “best” proprietary brands offer options for our more heavyduty diy customers as well as our professional service provider customers who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses 

we have no  longterm contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers we have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 815  suppliers the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24  of our total purchases in 2018  our largest supplier in 2018  accounted for approximately 8  of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3  to 5  of our total purchases 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer 

we use an integrated marketing program which includes radio instore digital and social media promotions as well as sports and event sponsorships and direct mail and newspaper promotional distributions to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the o’reilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events we also utilize a problemresolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles protecting their longterm automotive investment and establishing o’reilly as their partner for auto parts needs 

to stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 700  grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 45  states during 2018  we were the title sponsor of two  national association for stock car racing nascar national series events in 2018 

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” basketball our relationships with over 25  ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed o’reilly logos on tvvisible signs throughout the season 

we target spanishspeaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of spanish language radio print and outdoor advertising as well as sponsorships of local and regional festivals and events 

we invest in digital channels to expand the o’reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices as this continues to be an important point of contact with our customers search engine optimization and paid search strategies are used to drive traffic to our website and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers 

to show appreciation for our diy customers for their continued business we maintain our o’reilly o’rewards customer loyalty program the program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points for coupons which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores the programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns 

marketing to the professional service provider customer 

we have approximately 790  fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our first call program each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industryleading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider customers by providing the products and services identified below 



 

marketing to the independently owned parts store 

we also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores “jobber stores” in certain market areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an o’reilly store we administer a proprietary dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called parts city auto parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 180  jobber stores with total annual sales of approximately 62 million  as a participant in this program a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

pricing 

we believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock locally available product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors 

customer payments and returns policy 

our stores accept cash checks debit and credit cards we also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our preestablished credit requirements some of the factors considered in our preestablished credit requirements include customer creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer and current economic and industry trends no customer accounted for greater than one  percent of our consolidated net sales nor do we have any dependence on any single customer 

we accept product returns for new products core products and warrantydefective products 

industry environment 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 296 billion  according to the auto care association this market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately 93 billion  which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and diy sales at retail we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations 

competition 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with 



 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout continually enhancing the omnichannel experience and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including but not limited to those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty suppliers the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into supplierprovided containers and pallets and then recycled by the thirdparty suppliers in general our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the supplier 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date however we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

unless otherwise indicated “we” “us” “our” and similar terms as well as references to the “company” refer to o’reilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty in addition restrictions on access to telematics diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities furthermore the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

both the doityourself “diy” and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortments between us and a range of competitors which 

could result in pricing pressure some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional instore experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust regional distribution footprint which could also create pricing pressure we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and distribution centers “dcs” located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2019  and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them in addition the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them changes in us trade policies practices tariffs or taxes could affect our ability and our suppliers’ ability to source product at current volumes andor prices 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations and failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations 

or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs 

credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our unsecured senior notes preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flows 

a breach of customer supplier team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of information about our customers suppliers team members and the company some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however these security measures may be breached due to cyberattacks team member error system compromises fraud hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action in addition the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations and employment legislation and regulations may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices 

our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment legislation andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the taxation of business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the company is subject to taxation in the us in december 2017 comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted and the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex as tax laws and related regulations and interpretations change our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted

distribution centers stores and other properties 

as of december 31 2018  we operated 27  regional distribution centers “dc”s of which eight  were leased  28 million  operating square footage and 19  were owned  81 million  operating square footage for total dc operating square footage of 108 million  square feet the following table provides information regarding our dcs returns facility and corporate offices as of december 31 2018  



 

the leased distribution facilities typically require a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and have an original term of at a minimum 20 years subject to one fiveyear renewal at our option 

of the 5219  stores that we operated at december 31 2018  2119  stores were owned 3026  stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 74  stores were leased from entities that include one or more of our affiliated directors or members of their immediate family leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with one  of the seven  affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from april 30 2019  to september 30 2031  we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below 



 

results of operations 

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



 

2018  compared to 2017   

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 559 million  or 6  to 954 billion  from 898 billion  for the same period in 2017  comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 38  and 14  for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members online sales resulting from shiptohome orders and pickup instore orders for stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2018  in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broad selection of product offerings with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2018  was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both diy and professional service provider customers and positive transaction counts for professional service provider customers offset by negative transaction counts for diy customers the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of betterengineered and more technically advanced vehicles and same sku inflation these betterengineered more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time this decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts however when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which is a benefit to average ticket values during the year ended december 31 2018 diy transaction counts also continued to be pressured by increased gas prices and other inflationary impacts resulting in an increased deferral of vehicle maintenance and repairs over the short term 

we opened 200  net new stores during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to opening 190  net new stores during the year ended december 31 2017  as of december 31 2018  we operated 5219  stores in 47  states compared to 5019  stores in 47  states at december 31 2017  after the close of business on december 31 2018 we acquired the 33  bennett stores that were not included in our 2018 store count and were not operated by the company in 2018 we anticipate new store growth will be 200 to 210  net new store openings in 2019  and will net an additional 20 stores as we will merge 13 of the acquired 33  bennett stores into existing o’reilly stores during 2019 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 7  to 504 billion  or 528  of sales from 472 billion  or 526  of sales for the same period in 2017  the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily the result of sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to a noncash lastin firstout “lifo” charge in 2017 partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses the increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to wage pressure and increased transportation costs as compared to 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018 we did not realize net acquisition cost decreases and as a result we did not record a lifo charge during the year ended december 31 2017 our lifo costs were written down by approximately 22 million to reflect replacement cost 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 8  to 322 billion  or 338  of sales from 300 billion  or 334  of sales for the same period in 2017  the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count the planned allocation of a portion of the tax savings realized as a result of the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 the “tax act” and unfavorable comparison to a 2017 benefit of 91 million from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim the increase in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to our tax savings allocation initiatives and the 2017 legal accrual benefit 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 5  to 182 billion  or 190  of sales from 173 billion  or 192  of sales for the same period in 2017  

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 38  to 121 million  or 13  of sales from 88 million  or 10  of sales for the same period in 2017  the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2018  was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2018  decreased 27  to 370 million   218  effective tax rate from 504 million   308  effective tax rate for the same period in 2017  the decreases in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 were primarily the result of the lower federal corporate tax rate set forth by the tax act partially offset by a 53 million benefit in 2017 from the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower federal corporate tax rate set forth by the tax act and lower excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation in 2018 as compared 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018 and 2017 excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation were approximately 35 million and 49 million respectively 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 17  to 132 billion  or 139  of sales from 113 billion  or 126  of sales for the same period in 2017  

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 27  to 1610  on 82 million  shares from 1267  on 90 million  shares for the same period in 2017  due to the revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities in 2017 our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2017 included a onetime benefit of 059 

2017  compared to 2016   

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 385 million or 4 to 898 billion from 859 billion for the same period in 2016 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 14 and 48 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales from leap day during the year ended december 31 2016 online sales resulting from shiptohome orders and pickup instore orders for stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2017  in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth sales from the 48  acquired bond auto parts “bond” stores the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2017 was driven by increases in average ticket values for both diy and professional service provider customers partially offset by negative customer transaction counts from both our diy and professional service provider customers the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles these better engineered more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which is a benefit to average ticket values however the decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts in addition customer transaction counts for the year ended december 31 2017 were negatively impacted by softer industry demand resulting in part from the unseasonably mild winter weather at the onset of 2017 and a cool wet summer in many of our markets the mild winter weather did not stress vehicle components to the degree more typical harsh winter weather would which resulted in a lower level of automobile parts breakage and associated demand for our products the cool wet summer in many of our markets resulted in a lower level of demand as the absence of typical seasonally high temperatures resulted in fewer heat related product repairs 

we opened 190 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to opening 210 net new stores and acquiring 48  bond stores during the year ended december 31 2016 as of december 31 2017 we operated 5019 stores in 47 states compared to 4829 stores in 47 states at december 31 2016 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 5 to 472 billion or 526 of sales from 451 billion or 525 of sales for the same period in 2016 the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily a result of sales from new stores the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from the 48 acquired bond stores partially offset by gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to leap day for the same period one year prior the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to a smaller noncash lifo impact partially offset by a lower merchandise margin and higher inventory shrinkage the smaller lifo impact is the result of fewer product acquisition cost improvements during the year ended december 31 2017 compared 2016 our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 our lifo inventory costs were written down by approximately 22 million and 49 million respectively to reflect replacement cost the lower merchandise margin was primarily the result of merchandise mix driven by the unfavorable weather conditions during 2017 the higher inventory shrinkage was primarily cyclical in nature following a period of lower than average shrinkage trends 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 7 to 300 billion or 334 of sales from 281 billion or 327 of sales for the same period in 2016 the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count partially offset by a 91 million benefit from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim and incremental sga expenses incurred from one additional day due to leap day for the same period one year prior the increase in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to deleverage of store operating costs on soft comparable store sales during the year ended december 31 2017 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 2 to 173 billion or 192 of sales from 170 billion or 198 of sales for the same period in 2016 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 41 to 88 million or 10 of sales from 62 million or 07 of sales for the same period in 2016 the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017 decreased 16 to 504 million 308 effective tax rate from 600 million 366 effective tax rate for the same period in 2016 the decrease in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017 was the result of a onetime 53 million benefit to the provision for income taxes related to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower federal corporate income tax rate set forth by the tax act and excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation which provided a benefit of 49 million to the provision for income taxes the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities which provided a onetime benefit of 325 basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 and excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation which provided a benefit of 297 basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 9 to 113 billion or 126 of sales from 104 billion or 121 of sales for the same period in 2016 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 18 to 1267 on 90 million shares from 1073 on 97 million shares for the same period in 2016 due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2017 included a onetime benefit of 059 due to the adoption of asu 201609 our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2017 included a benefit of 050 

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the 

debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2018  and 2017  dollars in millions   



 

current assets increased 4  current liabilities increased 7  total debt increased 15  and total equity decreased 46  from 2017 to 2018 the increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory resulting from the opening of 200  net new stores in 2018 the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1057  as of december 31 2018 as compared to 1060  in the prior year the increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of 500 million of 4350 senior notes due 2028 and borrowings of 287 million  on our revolving credit facility at december 31 2018 the decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on retained deficit and additional paidincapital partially offset by a decrease in retained deficit from net income for the year ended december 31 2018 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in thousands 



 

operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily due to increased operating income reduced cash taxes paid due to the tax act and a reduction of accounts receivable due to the business day timing of yearend 2018 as compared to 2017 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to a smaller decrease in our net inventory investment partially offset by an increase in net income our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1060 1057 and 991 as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2017 

was primarily attributable to fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2017 and a smaller decrease in net inventory due to a softer sales environment as compared to 2016 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2018 and an increase in other investing activities total capital expenditures were 504 million  and 466 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions closings construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2018 as compared to 2017 the increase in other investing activities was primarily due to more acquisition related expenditures in 2018 as compared to 2017 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily the result of a decrease in other investing activities and a decrease in capital expenditures in 2017 the decrease in other investing activities was primarily due to less acquisition related expenditures in 2017 as compared to 2016 total capital expenditures were 466 million  and 476 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively and the decrease was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions closings construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2017 as compared to 2016 

we opened 200  190  and 210  net new stores in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively and acquired 48  bond stores in 2016 after the close of business on december 31 2018 we acquired the 33  bennett stores that were not included in our 2018 store count and were not operated by the company in 2018 we plan to open 200 to 210  net new stores in 2019  the current costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition building improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 16 million  to 18 million  however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily attributable to a lower level of net borrowings during 2018 as compared to 2017 partially offset by a lower level of repurchases of our common stock in 2018 as compared to 2017 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2017 as compared to 2016 partially offset by a higher level of net borrowings during 2017 as compared to 2016 

unsecured revolving credit facility 

on april 5 2017  the company entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” the credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 120 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” arranged by jpmorgan chase bank na which is scheduled to mature in april 2022  the credit agreement includes a 200 million  sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 75 million  sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility the company may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 600 million  provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed 180 billion  at any time 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had outstanding letters of credit primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amounts of 35 million  and 37 million  respectively reducing the aggregate availability under the credit agreement by those amounts as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility in the amounts of 287 million  and 346 million  respectively 

senior notes 

on may 17 2018  we issued 500 million  aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4350  senior notes due 2028 “4350 senior notes due 2028” at a price to the public of 99732  of their face value with umb bank na “umb” as trustee interest on the 4350 senior notes due 2028 is payable on june 1 and december 1 of each year which began on december 1 2018 and is computed on the basis of a 360 day year 

the company have issued a cumulative 315 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which are due between 2021  and 2028  with umb as trustee interest on the senior notes ranging from 3550  to 4875  is payable semiannually and is computed on the basis of a 360 day year none of our subsidiaries is a guarantor under our senior notes 

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes 

the credit agreement contains certain covenants including limitations on indebtedness a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 250 100 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 350 100 the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense capitalized interest and rent expense the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense adjusted debt includes outstanding debt outstanding standby letters of credit and similar instruments fivetimes rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of longterm debt in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement certain actions may be taken including but not limited to possible termination of commitments immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the credit agreement and litigation from our lenders 

we had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 538  times and 572  times as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and a consolidated leverage ratio of 210  times and 198  times as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements 

the table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  dollars in thousands 



the table below outlines the calculation of free cash flow and reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in thousands 



 

free cash flow the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the tables above a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

share repurchase program 

in january of 2011 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under the program we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices based on a variety of factors such as price corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions our board of directors may increase or otherwise modify renew suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice as announced on february 7 2018  and november 13 2018  our board of directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional 100 billion  resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of 1175 billion  each additional authorization is effective for a three year period beginning on its respective announcement date 

the following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program in thousands except per share data 



as of december 31 2018  we had 100 billion  remaining under our share repurchase program subsequent to the end of the year and through february 27 2019  we repurchased an additional 08 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of 34295  for a total investment of 269 million  we have repurchased a total of 73 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of 2011 and through february 27 2019  at an average price of 15073  for a total aggregate investment of 1102 billion  as of february 27 2019  we had approximately 07 billion  remaining under our share repurchase program 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other longterm liabilities which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 6 “leasing” note 10 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” and note 11 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

deferred income taxes as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2019  which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 13 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2018  we recorded a net liability of 39 million  related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included in “other liabilities” 

we record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is fully disclosed in note 10 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements this estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined as of december 31 2018  we recorded a liability of 25 million  related to this uncertain liability on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included in “other liabilities” 

the following table identifies the estimated payments of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  in thousands 



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we historically utilized various offbalance sheet financial instruments including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into any such transactions for over 10  years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million  sublimit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term 

from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 35 million  and 37 million  were outstanding at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources see “contractual obligations” section of item 7 of this annual report on form 10k and note 6 “leasing” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our operating leases 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

inventory obsolescence and shrink 

inventory which consists of automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and tools is stated at the lower of cost or market the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and accordingly have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of products is lower than our recorded cost this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate at a given point in time the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods ultimately our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if the shrink reserve changed 10  from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2018  the financial impact would have been approximately 1 million  or less than 01  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2018  

valuation of longlived assets and goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values as part of the evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting longterm estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact our impairment assessment 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have never recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 2018  nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of o’reilly’s stock which was a 

primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10  from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not  have changed and no further steps would have been required 

supplier concessions   

we receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements including cooperative advertising allowances for warranties merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates cooperative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred all other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations based on our historical results and current assessment we have not  recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements and we do not  believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations the eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

warranty reserves 

we offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties the risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims for this merchandise when sold we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales estimated warranty costs which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims if warranty reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2018  the financial impact would have been approximately 5 million  or 03  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2018  

selfinsurance reserves   

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability property loss and team member health care benefits with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities employment related claims and litigation certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability or property loss claim when estimating our selfinsurance liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience and trendlines projected medical and legal inflation growth patterns and exposure forecasts the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations our calculation of selfinsurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates which may result in material losses or gains as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods we adjust our selfinsurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value using a creditadjusted discount rate these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities if selfinsurance reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2018  the financial impact would have been approximately 15 million  or 09  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2018  

legal reserves   

we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which o’reilly is currently involved we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business management with the assistance of outside legal counsel must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures if legal reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2018  the financial impact would have been approximately 1 million  or 01  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2018  

taxes   

we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax 

authority experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions andor changes in tax regulations in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates alternatively we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may of 2014 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued accounting standard update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” now codified in the accounting standards codification “topic 606” under topic 606 an entity is required to follow a fivestep process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers topic 606 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer in addition an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers we adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective transition method with our first quarter ended march 31 2018 results of the year ended december 31 2018 were presented under topic 606 while amounts in prior periods were not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standard in effect for the prior periods the adoption of topic 606 did not have a material impact on our business process internal controls systems consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows as such a cumulative effective adjustment was not  recorded to opening retained earnings 

in february of 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 “leases topic 842” “asu 201602” under asu 201602 an entity will be required to recognize rightofuse assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements asu 201602 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases in july of 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201811 “leases topic 842 targeted improvement” “asu 201811” to provide an additional optional transition method for adopting asu 201602 which allows for an entity to choose to apply the new lease standard at adoption date and recognize a cumulativeeffective adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption while comparative periods presented will continue to be in accordance with current us gaap topic 840 for public companies topic 842 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within that reporting period we established a task force composed of multiple functional groups inside of the company which has substantially completed its objective of reviewing the critical components of the standard and implementing changes to systems and controls necessary to support the adoption of the new standard beginning with our first quarter ending march 31 2019 we will adopt this guidance using the additional optional transition method the package of transitional practical expedients relating to the identification classification and initial direct costs of leases commencing before the effective date of topic 842 and the transitional practical expedient for the treatment of existing land easements however we will not elect the hindsight transitional practical expedient we will make an accounting policy election to not apply recognition requirements of the guidance to shortterm leases the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the total assets and liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheet and we estimate net rightofuse assets and lease liability to be approximately 19 billion  and 20 billion  respectively as of january 1 2019 the difference between these amounts is primarily due to the accrual for straightline expense these estimates are based on our current lease portfolio and changes to the lease portfolio including the total number of leases lease commencement and end dates and lease termination expectations as well as changes in anticipated lease discount rates could impact these estimates we expect to make an adjustment to opening “retained deficit” on the consolidated balance sheet of approximately 14 million  related to the adoption of this new guidance the adoption of this new guidance will not  have a material impact on our results of operations cash flows liquidity or our covenant compliance under our existing credit agreement 

  

in march of 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 “compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” “asu 201609” under asu 201609 several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including tax consequence classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows were changed we adopted this guidance with our first quarter ending march 31 2017 upon adoption of asu 201609 the we elected to change our accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur this change was applied using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment of 03 million  to opening “retained earnings” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 we applied the amendments related to the presentation of tax withholdings on the statement of cash flows using the retrospective transition method which resulted in 06 million  of tax withholdings being reclassified from “net cash provided by operating activities” to “net cash used in financing activities” on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016 we elected to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using the retrospective transition method which resulted in 560 million  of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation being reclassified from “net cash used in financing activities” to “net cash provided by operating activities” in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016 asu 201609 amendments related to accounting for excess tax benefits in the income statement were adopted prospectively resulting in the reduction of 347 million  and 487 million  in “provision for income taxes” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

in june of 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 “financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” “asu 201613” under asu 201613 businesses and other organizations are required to present 

financial assets measured at amortized costs basis at the net amount expected to be collected the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis such as trade receivables the measurement of expected credit loss will be based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount for public companies asu 201613 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within that reporting period and requires a modified retrospective adoption with early adoption permitted we will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending march 31 2020 the application of this new guidance is not  expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in january of 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201704 “intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” “asu 201704” asu 201704 eliminates the second step in the previous process for goodwill impairment testing instead the test is now a onestep process that calls for goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value for public companies asu 201704 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within that reporting period and requires prospective adoption with early adoption after january 1 2017 we will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending march 31 2019 the application of this new guidance is not  expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general information 

o’reilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries collectively “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “o’reilly” is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself “diy” and professional service provider customers our “dual market strategy” the business was founded in 1957 by charles f o’reilly and his son charles h “chub’’ o’reilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri our common stock has traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “orly” since april 22 1993 

at december 31 2017  we operated 5019  stores in 47  states our stores carry an extensive product line including 

 

our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers such as 

 

see the “risk factors” section of item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others deteriorating economic conditions competition in the automotive aftermarket business our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions future growth assurance our dependence upon key and other personnel our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products our acquisition strategies complications in our distribution centers “dcs” failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock our increased debt levels a downgrade in our credit ratings data security and environmental legislation and other regulations 

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values including superior customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both diy and professional service provider customers 

competitive advantages 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

for more than 35  years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers 

in 2017  we derived approximately 58  of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 42  of our sales from our professional service provider customers historically we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business due to our systems knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket supported by our approximately 780  fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs accordingly each o’reilly store carries or has same or next day availability to a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below 

 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard part repairs in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional 

service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 27  regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 157000  stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust distribution network we operate 331  hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 48000  skus to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of 190  senior managers who average 19  years of service 244  corporate managers who average 16  years of service and 496  district managers who average 12  years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 25  consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2017  we opened 190  net new stores and we plan to open approximately 200  net new stores in 2018  which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores by 

 

new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts vehicles in operation number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features optimized square footage high ceilings convenient interior store layouts instore signage bright lighting convenient ingress and egress and parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 2017  we relocated 22  stores and renovated 25  stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

enhance and improve customer omnichannel experience 

regardless of how our customers begin their interaction whether instore over the telephone or electronically and complete their transaction whether instore or delivery to their home or business our goal is to provide excellent customer service and a seamless experience our userfriendly websites wwworeillyautocom  and wwwfirstcallonlinecom  allow our customers to search product and repair content check the instore availability of our products and place orders for either delivery or instore pickup we continue to enhance the functionality of our websites to provide our customers with a userfriendly and convenient shopping experience as well as a robust product and repair content information resource which will continue to build the o’reilly brand 

team members 

as of january 31 2018  we employed 75289  team members  45440  fulltime team members and 29849  parttime team members of whom 64104  were employed at our stores 8148  were employed at our dcs and 3037  were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 49  stores  477  team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years in addition approximately 67  team members who drive overtheroad trucks in two  of our dcs are represented by labor unions except for these team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition for 61  years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of each team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and respect has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

store network 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are 

 

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our stores on average carry approximately 23000  skus and average approximately 7300  total square feet in size at december 31 2017  we had a total of approximately 37 million  square feet in our 5019  stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 157000  skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 331  hub stores which on average carry approximately 48000  skus and average approximately 10900  square feet in size 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores’’ generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2017  and 2016  



store layout 

we utilize a computerassisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hardparts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of each particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation 

to enhance storelevel operations and provide consistently high levels of customer service we operate exclusive store automation systems that deliver quick pointofsale transaction processing times reduce our customers’ checkout time ensure accuracy and provide our professional parts people with immediate access to our proprietary electronic parts catalog part images technical schematics and pricing information based on each individual customer’s specific vehicle make model and year these systems track instore inventory availability and through connectivity with our dc and corporate systems allow realtime access to inventory available in nearby stores and dcs throughout our network our systems also capture detailed sales information which assists management in strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency and provide a mechanism to deliver ongoing team member training through our integrated digital learning platform 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 496  district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten  stores which provides our stores with a strong operational support 

store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a weeklong manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training field workshops regional meetings and our annual managers’ conference 

we provide financial incentives to all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability in addition each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store’s performance we believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers therefore our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from professional parts people particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager these team members then spend at least one day 

per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

distribution systems 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory moreover we believe our ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc network allow us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each dc 

distribution centers 

as of december 31 2017  we operated 27  dcs comprised of approximately 108 million  operating square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for a detailed listing of dc operating square footages our dcs stock an average of 157000  skus and most dcs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional dcs’ inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within an individual dc’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the dc’s “city counter” many of which receive this service seven days per week our dcs provide weekend service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic hub locations which redistribute products to surrounding stores our national hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2018  we plan to 

 • continue to define and implement best practices in all dcs and 

 

hub stores 

we currently operate 331  strategically located hub stores in addition to serving diy and professional service provider customers in their markets hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of skus on a sameday basis our hub stores average approximately 10900  square feet and carry an average of 48000  skus 

products and purchasing 

our stores offer diy and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco armor all bosch bwd cardone castrol gates rubber monroe moog pennzoil prestone quaker state stp turtle wax valvoline wagner and wix and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products which span the entire good better and best value spectrum under our besttest® brakebest® import direct® master pro® microgard® murray® omnispark® o’reilly auto parts® precision® power torque® super start® and ultima® brands our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands which we have acquired or developed over time our “good” proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value a characteristic important to our diy customers while our “better” and “best” proprietary brands offer options for our more heavyduty diy customers as well as our professional service provider customers who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses 

we have no  longterm contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers we have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 950  suppliers the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24  of our total purchases in 2017  our largest supplier in 2017  accounted for approximately 6  of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3  to 5  of our total purchases 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer 

we use an integrated marketing program which includes radio direct mail and newspaper distribution instore digital and social media promotions and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the o’reilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events we also utilize a problemresolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles protecting their longterm automotive investment and establishing o’reilly as their partner for auto parts needs 

to stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 1600  grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 47  states during 2017  we were the title sponsor of two  national association for stock car racing nascar national series events 

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” basketball our relationships with over 30  ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed o’reilly logos on tvvisible signs throughout the season 

we target spanishspeaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of spanish language radio print and outdoor advertising as well as sponsorships of local and regional festivals and events 

we invest in digital channels to expand the o’reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices as this continues to be an important point of contact with our customers search engine optimization and paid search strategies are used to drive traffic to our website and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers 

to show appreciation for our diy customers for their continued business we maintain our o’reilly o’rewards customer loyalty program the program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points for coupons which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores the programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns 

marketing to the professional service provider customer 

we have approximately 780  fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our first call program each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industryleading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider customers by providing the products and services identified below 



 

marketing to the independently owned parts store 

we also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores “jobber stores” in certain market areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an o’reilly store we administer a proprietary dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called parts city auto parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 180  jobber stores with total annual sales of approximately 61 million  as a participant in this program a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

pricing 

we believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock locally available product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors 

customer payments and returns policy 

our stores accept cash checks debit and credit cards we also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our preestablished credit requirements some of the factors considered in our preestablished credit requirements include customer creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms no customer accounted for greater than one  percent of our consolidated net sales nor do we have any dependence on any single customer 

we accept product returns for new products core products and warrantydefective products 

industry environment 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 287 billion  according to the auto care association this market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately 90 billion  which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and diy sales we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations 

competition 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with 

 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to 

maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including but not limited to those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty suppliers the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into supplierprovided containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty suppliers in general our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the supplier 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date however we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

unless otherwise indicated “we” “us” “our” and similar terms as well as references to the “company” refer to o’reilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty in addition restrictions on access to telematics diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities furthermore the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

both the doityourself “diy” and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortments between us and a range of competitors which could result in pricing pressure some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional instore experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust regional distribution footprint which could also create pricing pressure we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and distribution centers “dcs” located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2018  and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them in addition the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them changes in us trade policies practices tariffs or taxes could affect our ability and our suppliers’ ability to source product at current volumes andor prices 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations and failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs 

credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our unsecured senior notes preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flows 

a breach of customer supplier team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of information about our customers suppliers team members and the company some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however these security measures may be breached due to cyberattacks team member error system compromises fraud hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action in addition the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations and employment legislation and regulations may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices 

our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment legislation andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the taxation of business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the company is subject to taxation in the us in december 2017 comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted and the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex the final transition impacts of the tax act may differ materially from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report due to among other things changes in interpretations of the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted

overview 

we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states we are one of the largest us automotive aftermarket specialty retailers selling our products to both doityourself “diy” customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy” our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects “good” “better” and “best” alternatives our sales and total gross profit dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers including used oil oil filter and battery recycling battery wiper and bulb replacement battery diagnostic testing electrical and module testing check engine light code extraction loaner tool program drum and rotor resurfacing custom hydraulic hoses professional paint shop mixing and related materials and machine shops as of december 31 2017  we operated 5019  stores in 47  states 

operating within the retail industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer preferences and spending habits and competition we have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences and we also have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum 

we believe the key drivers of current and future demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles new light vehicle registrations average vehicle age and unemployment 

 

we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service 

key events and recent developments   

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below 

 

results of operations 

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



 

2017  compared to 2016   

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2017  increased 385 million  to 898 billion  from 859 billion  for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 4  comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 14  and 48  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales from leap day during the year ended december 31 2016 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2017  in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth sales from the 48  acquired bond stores the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2017  was driven by increases in average ticket values for both diy and professional service provider customers partially offset by negative customer transaction counts from both our diy and 

professional service provider customers the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles these better engineered more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which is a benefit to average ticket values however the decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts in addition customer transaction counts for the year ended december 31 2017 were negatively impacted by softer industry demand resulting in part from the unseasonably mild winter weather at the onset of 2017 and a cool wet summer in many of our markets the mild winter weather did not stress vehicle components to the degree more typical harsh winter weather would which resulted in a lower level of automobile parts breakage and associated demand for our products the cool wet summer in many of our markets resulted in a lower level of demand as the absence of typical seasonally high temperatures resulted in fewer heat related product repairs 

we opened 190  net new stores during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to opening 210  net new stores and acquiring 48  bond stores during the year ended december 31 2016  as of december 31 2017  we operated 5019  stores in 47  states compared to 4829  stores in 47  states at december 31 2016  we anticipate new store growth will be 200  net new store openings in 2018  

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2017  increased to 472 billion  or 526  of sales from 451 billion  or 525  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 5  the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily a result of sales from new stores the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from the 48 acquired bond stores partially offset by prior year gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to leap day the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to a smaller noncash lastin firstout “lifo” impact partially offset by a lower merchandise margin and higher inventory shrinkage the smaller lifo impact is the result of fewer product acquisition cost improvements during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period one year ago our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 our lifo inventory costs were written down by approximately 22 million and 49 million respectively to reflect replacement cost the lower merchandise margin was primarily the result of merchandise mix driven by the unfavorable weather conditions during 2017 the higher inventory shrinkage was primarily cyclical in nature following a period of lower than average shrinkage trends 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2017  increased to 300 billion  or 334  of sales from 281 billion  or 327  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 7  the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count partially offset by a 91 million benefit from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim and prior year incremental sga expenses incurred from one additional day due to leap day the increase in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to deleverage of store operating costs on soft comparable store sales during the current period 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2017  increased to 173 billion  or 192  of sales from 170 billion  or 198  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 2  

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2017  increased to 88 million  or 10  of sales from 62 million  or 07  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 41  the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017  decreased to 504 million   308  effective tax rate from 600 million   366  effective tax rate for the same period one year ago representing a decrease of 16  the decrease in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017 was the result of a onetime 53 million  benefit to the provision for income taxes related to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower federal corporate income tax rate set forth by the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 and the adoption of accounting standard update no 201609 “compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” “asu 201609” in 2017 which provided a benefit of 49 million  to the provision for income taxes the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities which provided a onetime benefit of 325  basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 and the adoption of asu 201609 in 2017 which provided a benefit of 297  basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2017  increased to 113 billion  or 126  of sales from 104 billion  or 121  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 9  

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2017  increased 18  to 1267  on 90 million  shares from 1073  on 97 million  shares for the same period one year ago due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2017 included a onetime benefit of 059  due to the adoption of asu 201609 our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2017 included a benefit of 050  

2016  compared to 2015   

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 626 million to 859 billion from 797 billion for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 8 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 48 and 75 for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales from leap day during the year ended december 31 2016 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2016  in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth sales from one additional day due to leap day for the year ended december 31 2016 sales from the acquired 48 bond stores the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2016 was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts from both our diy and professional service provider customers the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles these betterengineered more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time this decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts however when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which is a benefit to average ticket values customer transaction counts for both diy and professional service provider customers increased for the year ended december 31 2016 despite the added pressure from the better engineered more technically advanced vehicles requiring less frequent repairs the increase in customer transaction counts was supported by an increase in miles driven and the corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance lower yearoveryear gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels creating an overall positive macroeconomic environment the increase in our diy customer transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on ensuring our stores are staffed with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our diy customers during high diy traffic periods such as nights and weekends the 

increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature markets and our better parts and service availability 

we opened 210 net new stores and acquired 48 bond stores during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to opening 205 net new stores for the year ended december 31 2015 as of december 31 2016 we operated 4829 stores in 47 states compared to 4571 stores in 44 states at december 31 2015 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2016 increased to 451 billion or 525 of sales from 416 billion or 523 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 8 the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores sales from new stores and one additional day due to leap day the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements partially offset by a larger lifo impact product acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale the noncash lifo impact is the result of these continued product acquisition cost reductions and due to these reductions we fully depleted our lifo reserve in 2013 our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we were effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 our lifo costs were written down by approximately 49 million and 28 million respectively to reflect replacement cost 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga for the year ended december 31 2016 increased to 281 billion or 327 of sales from 265 billion or 332 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 6 the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and one additional day due to leap day the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on comparable store sales growth and a 19 million litigation loss charge in 2015 resulting from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2016 increased to 170 billion or 198 of sales from 151 billion or 190 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 12 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2016 increased to 62 million or 07 of sales from 54 million or 07 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 16 the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2016 increased to 600 million 366 effective tax rate from 529 million 362 effective tax rate for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 13 the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2016 was the result of higher taxable income in 2016 primarily driven by our strong operating results and higher effective tax rates the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily due to a larger amount of favorable resolutions of historical tax matters in 2015 compared to 2016 and a smaller benefit in 2016 from the realization of employment tax credits 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2016 increased to 104 billion or 121 of sales from 931 million or 117 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 11 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 17 to 1073 on 97 million shares from 917 on 102 million shares for the same period one year prior 

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured 

revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2017  and 2016  dollars in millions   



 

current assets increased 4  current liabilities increased 7  total debt increased 58  and total equity decreased 60  from 2016 to 2017 the increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory resulting from the opening of 190  net new stores in 2017 the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1060  as of december 31 2017 as compared to 1057  in the prior year the increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of 750 million of 3600 senior notes due 2027 and borrowings of 346 million  on our revolving credit facility at december 31 2017 the decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on retained deficit and additional paidincapital partially offset by a decrease in retained deficit from net income for the year ended december 31 2017 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in thousands 



 

operating activities 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to a smaller decrease in our net inventory investment partially offset by an increase in net income net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1060  1057  and 991  as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2017 was primarily attributable to fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2017 and a smaller decrease in net inventory due to a softer sales environment as compared to 2016 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater decrease in net inventory investment partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1057 991 and 946 as of december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2016 was primarily attributable to incrementally better terms from our suppliers and additional suppliers participating in our supplier financing programs the decrease from income taxes payable in 2016 compared to the increase in income taxes payable in 2015 was primarily the result of a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2016 versus an income taxes payable position at the end of 2015 

investing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily the result of a decrease in other investing activities and a decrease in capital expenditures in 2017 the decrease in other investing activities was primarily due to less acquisition related expenditures in 2017 as compared to 2016 total capital expenditures were 466 million  and 476 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively and the decrease was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions closings construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2017 as compared to 2016 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures and other investing activities in 2016 total capital expenditures were 476 million  and 414 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions closing and construction costs for new stores and our distribution expansion projects during 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase in other investing activities was primarily due to small acquisitions during 2016 

we opened 190  210  and 205  net new stores in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively and acquired 48  bond stores in 2016 we plan to open 200  net new stores in 2018  the current costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition building improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 16 million  to 18 million  however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2017 as compared to 2016 partially offset by a higher level of net borrowings during 2017 as compared to 2016 

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt during 2016 partially offset by a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2016 as compared to 2015 

unsecured revolving credit facility 

on april 5 2017  the company entered into a new credit agreement the “credit agreement” the new credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 120 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” arranged by jpmorgan chase bank na which is scheduled to mature in april 2022  the new credit agreement includes a 200 million  sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 75 million  sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the new credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility the company may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 600 million  provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed 180 billion  at any time 

in conjunction with the closing of the new credit agreement the company’s previous credit agreement which was originally entered into on january 14 2011 as amended was terminated the “terminated credit agreement” and all outstanding loans and commitments including the guarantees of each of the subsidiary guarantors under the terminated credit agreement were terminated and replaced by the loans and commitments under the new credit agreement none of our subsidiaries are guarantors or obligors under the new credit agreement 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had outstanding letters of credit primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amounts of 37 million  and 39 million  respectively reducing the aggregate availability under the new credit agreement by those amounts as of december 31 2017  we had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility in the amount of 346 million  as of december 31 2016  we had no  outstanding borrowings under our terminated unsecured revolving credit facility 

senior notes 

on august 17 2017  we issued 750 million  aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3600  senior notes due 2027 “3600 senior notes due 2027” at a price to the public of 99840  of their face value with umb bank na “umb” as trustee interest on the 

3600 senior notes due 2027 is payable on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning on march 1 2018 and is computed on the basis of a 360 day year 

we have issued a cumulative 265 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which are due between 2021  and 2027  with umb as trustee interest on the senior notes ranging from 3550  to 4875  is payable semiannually and is computed on the basis of a 360 day year none of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the senior notes 

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes 

the credit agreement contains certain covenants including limitations on indebtedness a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 250 100 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 350 100 the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense capitalized interest and rent expense the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense adjusted debt includes outstanding debt outstanding standby letters of credit and similar instruments fivetimes rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of longterm debt in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement certain actions may be taken including but not limited to possible termination of commitments immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the credit agreement and litigation from our lenders 

we had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 572  times and 615  times as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and a consolidated leverage ratio of 198  times and 151  times as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements 

the table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  dollars in thousands 



the table below outlines the calculation of free cash flow and reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in thousands 



 

free cash flow the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the tables above a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

share repurchase program 

in january of 2011 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under the program we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices based on a variety of factors such as price corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions our board of directors may increase or otherwise modify renew suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice as announced on may 10 2017  september 1 2017  and february 7 2018  our board of directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional 100 billion  resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of 1075 billion  each additional authorization is effective for a three year period beginning on its respective announcement date 

the following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program in thousands except per share data 



as of december 31 2017  we had 715 million  remaining under our share repurchase program subsequent to the end of the year and through february 28 2018  we repurchased an additional 11 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of 25548  for a total investment of 290 million  we have repurchased a total of 67 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of 2011 and through february 28 2018  at an average price of 13838  for a total aggregate investment of 932 billion  as of february 28 2018  we had approximately 143 billion  remaining under our share repurchase program 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other longterm liabilities which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 6 “leasing” note 9 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” and note 10 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

deferred income taxes as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2018  which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 12 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2017  we recorded a net liability of 41 million  related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included in “other liabilities” 

we record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is fully disclosed in note 9 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements this estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined as of december 31 2017  we recorded a liability of 26 million  related to this uncertain liability on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included in “other liabilities” 

the following table identifies the estimated payments of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  in thousands 



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we historically utilized various offbalance sheet financial instruments including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five  years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million  sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 37 million  and 39 million  were outstanding at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources see “contractual obligations” section of item 7 of this annual report on form 10k and note 6 “leasing” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our operating leases 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

inventory obsolescence and shrink 

inventory which consists of automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and tools is stated at the lower of cost or market the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and accordingly have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of products is lower than our recorded cost this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate at a given point in time the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods ultimately our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if the shrink reserve changed 10  from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2017  the financial impact would have been approximately 1 million  or less than 01  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2017  

valuation of longlived assets and goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values as part of the evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting longterm estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact our impairment assessment 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have never recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 2017  nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of o’reilly’s stock which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10  from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not  have changed and no further steps would have been required 

supplier concessions   

we receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements including cooperative advertising allowances for warranties merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates cooperative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred all other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations based on our historical results and current assessment we have not  recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements and we do not  believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations the eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

warranty reserves 

we offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties the risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims for this merchandise when sold we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales estimated warranty costs which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims if warranty reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2017  the financial impact would have been approximately 4 million  or 03  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2017  

selfinsurance reserves   

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability property loss and team member health care benefits with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities employment related claims and litigation certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability or property loss claim when estimating our selfinsurance liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience and trendlines projected medical and legal inflation growth patterns and exposure forecasts the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations our calculation of selfinsurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates which may result in material losses or gains as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods we adjust our selfinsurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value using a creditadjusted discount rate these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities if selfinsurance reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2017  the financial impact would have been approximately 14 million  or 08  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2017  

legal reserves   

we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which o’reilly is currently involved we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business management with the assistance of outside legal counsel must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures if legal reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2017  the financial impact would have been approximately 3 million  or 02  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2017  

taxes   

we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions andor changes in tax regulations in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates alternatively we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these 

increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

quarterly results 

the following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown in thousands except per share and comparable store sales data

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general information 

o’reilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries collectively “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “o’reilly” is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself “diy” and professional service provider customers our “dual market strategy” the business was founded in 1957 by charles f o’reilly and his son charles h “chub’’ o’reilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri our common stock has traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “orly” since april 22 1993 

at december 31 2016  we operated 4829  stores in 47  states our stores carry an extensive product line including 

 

our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers such as 

 

see the “risk factors” section of item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others deteriorating economic conditions competition in the automotive aftermarket business our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions future growth assurance our dependence upon key and other personnel our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products our acquisition strategies complications in our distribution centers “dcs” failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock our increased debt levels a downgrade in our credit ratings data security and environmental legislation and other regulations 

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values including superior customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both diy and professional service provider customers 

competitive advantages 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

for more than 35  years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers 

in 2016  we derived approximately 58  of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 42  of our sales from our professional service provider customers historically we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business due to our systems knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket supported by our approximately 750  fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs accordingly each o’reilly store carries or has same or next day availability to a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below 

 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard part repairs in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional 

service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 27  regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 148000  stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust distribution network we operate 312  hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 45000  skus to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 185  professionals who average 18  years of service 242  corporate managers who average 16  years of service and 474  district managers who average 12  years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 24  consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2016  we opened 210  net new stores and acquired 48  bond auto parts stores and we plan to open approximately 190  net new stores in 2017  which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores by 

 

new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts vehicles in operation number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features optimized square footage high ceilings convenient interior store layouts instore signage bright lighting convenient ingress and egress and parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 2016  we relocated 20  stores and renovated 30  stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

continually enhance the growth and functionality of our ecommerce website 

our userfriendly website wwworeillyautocom  allows our customers to search product and repair content check the instore availability of our products and place orders for either home delivery or instore pickup we continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience as well as a robust product and repair content information resource which will continue to build the o’reilly brand 

team members 

as of january 31 2017  we employed 74715  team members  42289  fulltime team members and 32426  parttime team members of whom 63380  were employed at our stores 7907  were employed at our dcs and 3428  were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 49  stores  493  team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years in addition approximately 104  team members who drive overtheroad trucks in three  of our dcs are represented by labor unions except for these team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition for 60  years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of each team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and respect has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

store network 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are 

 

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our stores on average carry approximately 23000  skus and average approximately 7300  total square feet in size at december 31 2016  we had a total of approximately 35 million  square feet in our 4829  stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 148000  skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 312  hub stores which on average carry approximately 45000  skus and average approximately 10600  square feet in size 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores’’ generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2016  and 2015  



store layout 

we utilize a computerassisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hardparts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation 

to enhance storelevel operations customer service and reliability we use linux servers and ibm iseries computer systems in our stores these systems are linked with the iseries computers located in each of our dcs our pointofsale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog part images and schematics and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 474  district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten  stores which provides our stores with a strong operational support

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers therefore our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from professional parts people particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager afterward these team members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

distribution systems

distribution centers

we have no  longterm contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers we have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 900  suppliers the five largest of which accounted for approximately 23  of our total purchases in 2016  our largest supplier in 2016  accounted for approximately 6  of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3  to 5  of our total purchases 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer 

we use an integrated marketing program which includes radio direct mail and newspaper distribution instore online and social media promotions and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the o’reilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events we also utilize a problemresolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles protecting their longterm automotive investment and establishing o’reilly as their partner for auto parts needs 

to stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 1600  grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 45  states during 2016  we were the title sponsor of two  national association for stock car racing nascar national series events 

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” basketball our relationships with over 30  ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed o’reilly logos on tvvisible signs throughout the season 

we target spanish speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of spanish language radio print and outdoor advertising as well as sponsorships of over 45  local and regional festivals and events 

as consumers increasingly turn to the internet for information and offers we continue to invest in digital channels to expand the o’reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices search engine optimization strategies are used to drive traffic to our website and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers 

to show appreciation for our diy customers for their continued business we maintain our o’reilly o’rewards customer loyalty program the program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores the programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns 

marketing to the professional service provider customer 

we have approximately 750  fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our first call program each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industryleading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider customers by providing the products and services identified below 

 

marketing to the independently owned parts store 

we also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores “jobber stores” in certain market areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an o’reilly store we administer a proprietary dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called parts city auto parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 190  jobber stores with total annual sales of approximately 62 million  as a participant in this program a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

pricing 

we believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area 

customer payments and returns policy 

our stores accept cash checks debit and credit cards we also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our preestablished credit requirements some of the factors considered in our preestablished credit requirements include customer creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms no customer accounted for greater than one  percent of our consolidated net sales nor do we have any dependence on any single customer 

we accept product returns for new products core products and warrantydefective products 

industry environment 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 268 billion  according to the auto care association this market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately 154 billion  which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and diy sales we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations 

competition 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with 

 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty suppliers the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into supplierprovided containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty suppliers in general our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the supplier 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date however we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

unless otherwise indicated “we” “us” “our” and similar terms as well as references to the “company” refer to o’reilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could 

have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions in addition restrictions on access to telematics diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities furthermore the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the doityourself “diy” and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and distribution centers “dcs” located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2017  and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient 

and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them changes in us trade policies practices tariffs or taxes could affect our ability and our suppliers’ ability to source product at current volumes andor prices 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations and failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs 

credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our unsecured senior notes preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flows 

a breach of customer team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team members we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations employment legislation and regulations and healthcare reform legislation may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices 

our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment legislation andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the enacted patient protection and affordable care act as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by congress and state legislatures significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcarerelated expenses we continue to evaluate potential additional impacts the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impacts if we cannot effectively mitigate the potential additional impacts of the healthcare reform legislation our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted

key events and recent developments   

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below 

 

results of operations 

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



 

2016  compared to 2015   

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2016  increased 626 million  to 859 billion  from 797 billion  for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 8  comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 48  and 75  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales from leap day during the year ended december 31 2016 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2016  in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth sales from one additional day due to leap day for the year ended december 31 2016 sales from the acquired 48  bond stores the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2016  was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts from both our diy and professional service provider customers the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles these better engineered more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time this decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts however when repairs are needed the cost of replacement parts is on average greater which is a benefit to average ticket values customer transaction counts for both diy and professional service provider customers increased for the year ended december 31 2016 despite the added pressure from the better engineered more technically advance vehicles requiring less frequent repairs the increase in customer transaction counts was supported by an increase in miles driven and the corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance lower yearoveryear gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels creating an overall positive macroeconomic environment the increase in our diy customer transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on ensuring our stores are staffed with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our diy customers during high diy traffic periods such as nights and weekends the increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature markets and our better parts and service availability 

we opened 210  net new stores and acquired 48  bond stores during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to opening 205  net new stores for the year ended december 31 2015  as of december 31 2016  we operated 4829  stores in 47  states compared to 4571  stores in 44  states at december 31 2015  we anticipate new store growth will be 190  net new store openings in 2017  slightly below the 2016 net new store openings due to the resources necessary to convert the acquired 48  bond stores to our systems inventory selection and décor packages during 2017 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2016  increased to 451 billion  or 525  of sales from 416 billion  or 523  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 8  the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores sales from new stores and one additional day due to leap day the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements partially offset by a larger noncash lastin firstout “lifo” impact product acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale the noncash lifo impact is the result of these continued product acquisition cost reductions and due to these reductions we fully depleted our lifo reserve in 2013 our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 our lifo costs were written down by approximately 49 million and 28 million respectively to reflect replacement cost 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2016  increased to 281 billion  or 327  of sales from 265 billion  or 332  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 6  the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and one additional day due to leap day the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on comparable store sales growth and a 19 million litigation loss charge in the prior year resulting from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2016  increased to 170 billion  or 198  of sales from 151 billion  or 190  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 12  

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2016  increased to 62 million  or 07  of sales from 54 million  or 07  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 16  the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities for additional information concerning our trading securities see notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2016  increased to 600 million   366  effective tax rate from 529 million   362  effective tax rate for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 13  the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2016 was the result of higher taxable income in 2016 primarily driven by our strong operating results and higher effective tax rates the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily 

due to a larger amount of favorable resolutions of historical tax matters in 2015 compared to 2016 and a smaller benefit in 2016 from the realization of employment tax credits 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2016  increased to 104 billion  or 121  of sales from 931 million  or 117  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 11  

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2016  increased 17  to 1073  on 97 million  shares from 917  on 102 million  shares for the same period one year ago

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2015 increased 751 million to 797 billion from 722 billion for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 10 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 75 and 60 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively comparable store sales were calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members

we opened 205 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 200 net new stores for the year ended december 31 2014 as of december 31 2015 we operated 4571 stores in 44 states compared to 4366 stores in 43 states at december 31 2014 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2015 increased to 416 billion or 523 of sales from 371 billion or 514 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 12 the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements a smaller noncash negative lifo impact and distribution system efficiencies acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale the noncash negative lifo impact is the result of our continued product acquisition cost reductions and due to these acquisition cost reductions we fully depleted our lifo reserve in 2013 our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we were effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 our lifo costs were written down by approximately 28 million and 41 million respectively to reflect replacement cost distribution system efficiencies are the result of leverage on our increased sales volumes and lower fuel costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga for the year ended december 31 2015 increased to 265 billion or 332 of sales from 244 billion or 338 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 9 the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and a 19 million litigation loss charge from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2015 increased to 151 billion or 190 of sales from 127 billion or 176 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 19 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2015 increased to 54 million or 07 of sales from 48 million or 07 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 11 the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest in 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015 increased to 529 million 362 effective tax rate from 444 million 363 effective tax rate for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 19 the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015 was the result of higher taxable income in 2015 driven by our strong operating results the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to the nontypical favorable tax reserve adjustment which was related to historical tax positions due to a previous acquisition partially offset by a decreased benefit in 2015 from the realization of employment tax credits 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2015 increased to 931 million or 117 of sales from 778 million or 108 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 20 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2015 increased 25 to 917 on 102 million shares from 734 on 106 million shares for the same period one year prior 

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit 

facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2016  and 2015  dollars in millions   



 

current assets increased 8  current liabilities increased 12  total debt increased 36  and total equity decreased 17  from 2015 to 2016 the increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory resulting from the opening of 210  net new stores and acquiring 48  bond stores in 2016 the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our supplier financing program during the year our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1057  as of december 31 2016 as compared to 991  in the prior year the increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of 500 million of 3550 senior notes due 2026 the decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paidincapital and retained earnings partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in thousands 



 

operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater decrease in net inventory investment partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable  net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 1057  991  and 946  as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2016 was primarily attributable to incrementally better terms from our suppliers and additional suppliers participating in our supplier financing programs the decrease from income taxes payable in 2016 compared to the increase in income taxes payable in 2015 was primarily the result of a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2016 versus an income taxes payable position at the end of 2015 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater increase in income taxes payable partially offset by a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a decrease in accrued payrollrelated liabilities the larger increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of higher accrued income taxes payable at the end of 2015 as compared to the end of 2014 our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs the smaller decrease in net inventory investment in 2015 was the result of fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2015 as compared to 2014 our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 991 and 946 

as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in accrued payrollrelated liabilities during 2015 as compared to the increase in 2014 was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures and other investing activities in 2016 total capital expenditures were 476 million  and 414 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions closings and construction costs for new stores and our distribution expansion projects during 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase in other investing activities was primarily due to small acquisitions during 2016 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures total capital expenditures were 414 million  and 430 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively and the decrease was primarily related to the construction of additional distribution facilities in 2014 to support our ongoing store growth partially offset by an increase in the number of new store openings in 2015 

we opened 210  205  and 200  net new stores in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively and acquired 48  bond stores in 2016 we plan to open 190  net new stores in 2017  the current costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition building improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 15 million  to 18 million  however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site 

financing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt during 2016 partially offset by a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2016 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2015 

unsecured revolving credit facility 

on january 14 2011  we entered into a credit agreement as amended by amendment no 1 dated as of september 9 2011  as further amended by amendment no 2 dated as of july 2 2013  and as further amended by amendment no 3 dated as of june 18 2015  the “credit agreement” the credit agreement provides for a 600 million  unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” arranged by bank of america na which is scheduled to mature in july 2018  the credit agreement includes a 200 million  sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 75 million  sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility we may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 200 million  

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had outstanding letters of credit primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amounts of 39 million  and 38 million  respectively reducing the aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility by those amounts as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had no  outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

senior notes 

on march 8 2016  we issued 500 million  aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3550  senior notes due 2026 “3550 senior notes due 2026” at a price to the public of 99832  of their face value with united missouri bank na “umb” as trustee interest on the 3550 senior notes due 2026 is payable on march 15 and september 15 of each year which began with the first interest payment on september 15 2016 and is computed on the basis of a 360 day year

subsidiaries neither we nor any of our subsidiary guarantors are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries except as provided by applicable law 

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes 

the credit agreement contains certain covenants including limitations on indebtedness a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 250  times and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 300  times the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” fixed charges include interest expense capitalized interest and rent expense the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to ebitdar adjusted debt includes outstanding debt outstanding standby letters of credit and similar instruments sixtimes rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of longterm debt in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement certain actions may be taken including but not limited to possible termination of commitments immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the credit agreement and litigation from our lenders we had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 615  times and 599  times as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and a consolidated leverage ratio of 163  times and 152  times as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements under our current financing plan we have targeted an adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio range of 200  times to 225  times 

the table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  dollars in thousands 



free cash flow the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the tables above a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

share repurchase program 

in january of 2011 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under the program we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices based on a variety of factors such as price corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions our board of directors may increase or otherwise modify renew suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice as announced on february 10 2016  may 27 2016  and november 16 2016  our board of directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional 750 million  resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of 775 billion  each additional authorization is effective for a three year period beginning on its respective announcement date 

the following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program in thousands except per share data 



as of december 31 2016  we had 888 million  remaining under our share repurchase program subsequent to the end of the year and through february 28 2017  we repurchased an additional 14 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of 26732  for a total investment of 388 million  we have repurchased a total of 58 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of 2011 and through february 28 2017  at an average price of 12414  for a total aggregate investment of 725 billion  as of february 28 2017  we had approximately 500 million  remaining under our share repurchase program 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other longterm liabilities which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 6 “leasing” note 9 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” and note 10 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

deferred income taxes as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2017  which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 12 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2016  we recorded a net liability of 41 million  related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of “other liabilities” 

we record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is fully disclosed in note 9 “sharebased compensation and benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements this 

estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined as of december 31 2016  we recorded a liability of 20 million  related to this uncertain liability on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of “other liabilities” 

the following table identifies the estimated payments of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  in thousands 



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we historically utilized various offbalance sheet financial instruments including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five  years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million  sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 39 million  and 38 million  were outstanding at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources see “contractual obligations” section of item 7 of this annual report on form 10k and note 6 “leasing” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our operating leases 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these 

estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

inventory obsolescence and shrink 

inventory which consists of automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and tools is stated at the lower of cost or market the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and accordingly have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate at a given point in time the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods ultimately our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if the shrink reserve changed 10  from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2016  the financial impact would have been approximately 1 million  or 01  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2016  

valuation of longlived assets and goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values as part of the evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting longterm estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact our impairment assessment 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have never recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 2016  nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of o’reilly’s stock which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10  from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not  have changed and no further steps would have been required 

supplier concessions   

we receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements including cooperative advertising allowances for warranties merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates cooperative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred all other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations based on our historical results and current assessment we have not  recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements and we do not  believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations the eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

warranty reserves 

we offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties the risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims for this merchandise when sold we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales estimated warranty costs which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims if warranty reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2016  the financial impact would have been approximately 4 million  or 02  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2016  

selfinsurance reserves   

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability property loss and team member health care benefits with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities employment related claims and litigation certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability or property loss claim when estimating our selfinsurance liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience and trendlines projected medical and legal inflation growth patterns and exposure forecasts the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations our calculation of selfinsurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates which may result in material losses or gains as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods we adjust our selfinsurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value using a creditadjusted discount rate these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities if selfinsurance reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2016  the financial impact would have been approximately 13 million  or 08  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2016  

legal reserves   

we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which o’reilly is currently involved we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business management with the assistance of outside legal counsel must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures if legal reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2016  the financial impact would have been approximately 4 million  or 02  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2016  

taxes   

we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions andor changes in tax regulations in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates alternatively we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able 

to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

quarterly results 

the following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown in thousands except per share and comparable store sales data 





 

the unaudited operating data presented above should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report and the other financial information included therein

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general information 

oreilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries collectively we us our the company or oreilly is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself diy and professional service provider customers our dual market strategy the business was founded in 1957 by charles f oreilly and his son charles h chub oreilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri our common stock has traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol orly since april 22 1993 

  

at december 31 2015  we operated 4571  stores in 44  states our stores carry an extensive product line including 

 

our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers such as 

 

see the risk factors section of item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others deteriorating economic conditions competition in the automotive aftermarket business our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions future growth assurance our dependence upon key and other personnel our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products our acquisition strategies complications in our distribution centers dcs failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock our increased debt levels a downgrade in our credit ratings data security and environmental legislation and other regulations 

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core oreilly values including superior customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both diy and professional service provider customers 

competitive advantages 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

for more than 35  years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers 

in 2015  we derived approximately 58  of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 42  of our sales from our professional service provider customers historically we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business due to our systems knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket supported by our approximately 700  fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs accordingly each oreilly store carries or has same or next day availability to a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below 

 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard part repairs in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 26  regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 146000  stock keeping units skus many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust dc network we operate 297  hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 44000  skus to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to promote from within and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 174  professionals who average 18  years of service 236  corporate managers who average 16  years of service and 444  district managers who average 12  years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 23  consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2015  we opened 205  net new stores and we plan to open approximately 210  net new stores in 2016  which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new stores by i constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store or iii purchasing multistore chains new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts number and type of existing automotive repair facilities competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius and the number of competitors 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features optimized square footage high ceilings convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage bright lighting convenient ingress and egress and parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 

2015  we relocated 24  stores and renovated 41  stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

continually enhance the growth and functionality of our ecommerce website 

our userfriendly website wwworeillyautocom  allows our customers to search product and repair content check the instore availability of our products and place orders for either home delivery or instore pickup we continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience as well as a robust product and repair content information resource which will continue to build the oreilly brand 

team members 

as of january 31 2016  we employed 71943  team members  37879  fulltime team members and 34064  parttime team members of whom 61411  were employed at our stores 7612  were employed at our dcs and 2920  were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 50  stores  538  team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years in addition approximately 108  team members who drive overtheroad trucks in three  of our dcs are represented by a labor union except for these team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition for 59  years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our live green culture which emphasizes the importance of each team members contribution to the success of oreilly this focus on professionalism and respect has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

store network 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are 

 

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our stores on average carry approximately 23000  skus and average approximately 7200  total square feet in size at december 31 2015  we had a total of approximately 33 million  square feet in our 4571  stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 146000  skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 297  hub stores which on average carry approximately 44000  skus and average approximately 10000  square feet in size 

we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2015  and 2014  



store layout 

we utilize a computerassisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hardparts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each stores geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation 

to enhance storelevel operations customer service and reliability we use linux servers and ibm iseries computer systems in our stores these systems are linked with the iseries computers located in each of our dcs our pointofsale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog part images and schematics and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle this system speeds transaction times reduces the customers checkout time ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 444  district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten  stores which provides our stores with a strong operational support 

store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a weeklong manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri store and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments field workshops regional meetings and our annual managers conference 

we provide financial incentives to all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability in addition each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their stores performance we believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers therefore our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from professional parts people particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the oreilly certified parts professional test passing the oreilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager afterward these team members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

distribution systems 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory moreover we believe our ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each dc 

distribution centers 

as of december 31 2015  we operated 26  dcs comprised of approximately 100 million  operating square feet see the properties table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of dc operating square footages our dcs stock an average of 146000  skus and most dcs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional dcs onhand inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within an individual dcs metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the dcs city counter most of which receive this service seven days per week our dcs also provide weekend service not only to stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic hub locations which redistribute products to surrounding stores our national hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2016  we plan to 

 • continue to define and implement best practices in all dcs

we have no  longterm contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers we have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 900  suppliers the five largest of which accounted for approximately 22  of our total purchases in 2015  our largest supplier in 2015  accounted for approximately 6  of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3  to 5  of our total purchases 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer 

we use an integrated marketing program which includes radio direct mail and newspaper distribution instore online and social media promotions and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the oreilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events we also utilize a problemresolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles protecting their longterm automotive investment and establishing oreilly as their partner for auto parts needs 

to stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 1300  grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 43  states during 2015  we were the title sponsor of two  national association for stock car racing nascar national series events and one  national hot rod association nhra race 

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association ncaa basketball our relationships with over 30  ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed oreilly logos on tvvisible signs throughout the season 

we target spanish speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of spanish language radio print and outdoor advertising as well as sponsorships of over 45  local and regional festivals and events 

as consumers increasingly turn to the internet for information and offers we continue to invest in digital channels to expand the oreilly brand presence online and through mobile devices search engine optimization strategies are used to drive traffic to our website and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers 

to show appreciation for our diy customers for their continued business we maintain our oreilly orewards customer loyalty program the program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores the programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns

 9 

marketing to the independently owned parts store 

we also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores jobber stores in certain market areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an oreilly store we administer a proprietary dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called parts city auto parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 190  jobber stores with total annual sales of approximately 60 million  as a participant in this program a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

pricing 

we believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area 

customer payments and returns policy 

our stores accept cash checks debit and credit cards we also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our preestablished credit requirements some of the factors considered in our preestablished credit requirements include customer creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms no customer accounted for greater than one  percent of our consolidated net sales nor do we have any dependence on any single customer 

we accept product returns for new products core products and warrantydefective products 

industry environment 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 256 billion  according to the auto care association this market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales oreillys addressable market within this industry is approximately 146 billion  which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and diy sales we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations 

competition 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with 

 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

 item 1a risk factors 

unless otherwise indicated we us our and similar terms as well as references to the company refer to oreilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial 

institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities furthermore the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the doityourself diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the competition section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and distribution centers dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2016  and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the growth strategy section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the business section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 14 

 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations and failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 15 

 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs 

credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our credit facility a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flows 

a breach of customer team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team members we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations employment legislation and regulations and healthcare reform legislation may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices 

our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment legislation andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the enacted patient protection and affordable care act as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by congress and state legislatures significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcarerelated expenses we continue to evaluate potential additional impacts the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impacts if we cannot effectively mitigate the potential additional impacts of the healthcare reform legislation our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted

we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2015  was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both our diy and professional service provider customers the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles and this improvement was without the benefit of an increase in the selling price of like kind items 

these better engineered vehicles require less frequent repairs as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time which does create pressure on customer transaction counts however when repairs are required the cost of replacement parts is on average greater despite pressure from these better engineered vehicles requiring less frequent repairs customer transaction counts increased for both our diy and professional service provider customers for the year ended december 31 2015 these increases in transaction counts were driven by an increase in miles driven and a corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance which was led by lower gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels these factors created a positive macroeconomic environment which was beneficial to both diy and professional service provider customer transaction counts in addition the increase in our diy transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our diy customers during high diy traffic periods including nights and weekends and the increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature stores 

we opened 205  net new stores during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 200  net new stores for the year ended december 31 2014  as of december 31 2015  we operated 4571  stores in 44  states compared to 4366  stores in 43  states at december 31 2014  we anticipate total new store growth to increase to 210  net new store openings in 2016  

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2015  increased to 416 billion  or 523  of sales from 371 billion  or 514  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 12  the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements a smaller noncash negative lastin lastout lifo impact and distribution system efficiencies acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale the noncash negative lifo impact is the result of our continued product acquisition cost reductions and due to these acquisition cost reductions we fully depleted our lifo reserve in 2013 our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 our lifo costs were written down by approximately 28 million and 41 million respectively to reflect replacement cost distribution system efficiencies are the result of leverage on our increased sales volumes and lower fuel costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses sga for the year ended december 31 2015  increased to 265 billion  or 332  of sales from 244 billion  or 338  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 9  the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and a 19 million litigation loss charge from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2015  increased to 151 billion  or 190  of sales from 127 billion  or 176  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 19  

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2015  increased to 54 million  or 07  of sales from 48 million  or 07  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 11  the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015  increased to 529 million   362  effective tax rate from 444 million   363  effective tax rate for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 19  the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015 was the result of higher taxable income in 2015 driven by our strong operating results the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to the nontypical favorable tax reserve adjustment which was related to historical tax positions due to a previous acquisition partially offset by a decreased benefit in the current period from the realization of employment tax credits 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2015  increased to 931 million  or 117  of sales from 778 million  or 108  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 20  

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2015  increased 25  to 917  on 102 million  shares from 734  on 106 million  shares for the same period one year ago 

2014  compared to 2013   

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 567 million to 722 billion from 665 billion for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 9 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 60 and 43 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2014  in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2014 was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both diy and professional service provider customers the improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales the overall growth in our hard part categories continues to be driven by our faster growing professional service provider sales which are primarily comprised of hard part categories and by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles these vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time however when repairs are required the cost of the replacement parts is on average greater while the less frequent repairs required by these better engineered and manufactured vehicles does create pressure on transaction counts both diy and professional service provider customer transaction counts were positive for the year ended december 31 2014 the increases in professional service provider customer transaction counts were primarily driven by our acquired markets and the continued growth of less mature stores the increases in diy transaction counts were driven by our ongoing focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our diy customers during high diy traffic periods including nights and weekends 

we opened 200 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 190 net new stores for the year ended december 31 2013 as of december 31 2014 we operated 4366 stores in 43 states compared to 4166 stores in 42 states at december 31 2013 

  

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2014 increased to 371 billion or 514 of sales from 337 billion or 507 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 10 the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements partially offset by the lifo negative impact resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions acquisition cost improvements 

are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs during the third quarter of 2013 we fully depleted our lifo reserve due to acquisition cost improvements we realized over time our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 our lifo costs were written down by approximately 41 million and 22 million respectively to reflect replacement cost 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga for the year ended december 31 2014 increased to 244 billion or 338 of sales from 227 billion or 341 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 8 the increase in total sga dollars for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2014 increased to 127 billion or 176 of sales from 110 billion or 166 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 15 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2014 increased to 48 million or 07 of sales from 45 million or 07 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 8 the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014 increased to 444 million 363 effective tax rate from 389 million 367 effective tax rate for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 14 the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014 was the result of higher taxable income in 2014 driven by our strong operating results the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to increased benefits from the realization of employment tax credits in 2014 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2014 increased to 778 million or 108 of sales from 670 million or 101 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 16 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 22 to 734 on 106 million shares from 603 on 111 million shares for the same period one year prior 

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2015  and 2014  dollars in millions   



 

current liabilities increased 8  from 2014  to 2015  the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our enhanced supplier financing program during the year which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 991  as of december 31 2015  as compared to 946  in the prior year 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in thousands 



 

operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater increase in income taxes payable partially offset by a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a decrease in accrued payrollrelated liabilities the larger increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of higher accrued income taxes payable at the end of 2015 as compared to the end of 2014 net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs our supplier financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers the smaller decrease in net inventory investment in 2015 was the result of fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2015 as compared to 2014 our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 991  and 946  as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in accrued payrollrelated liabilities during 2015 as compared to the increase in 2014 was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily due to a greater decrease in net inventory investment and larger increases in net income and accrued payrollrelated liabilities in 2014 as compared to 2013 the greater decrease in our net inventory investment was the result of increased supplier participation and support of our supplier financing programs our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 946 and 866 as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in accrued payrollrelated liabilities during 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates and timing of payments for employer obligations under certain benefit plans 

investing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures total capital expenditures were 414 million  and 430 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively and the decrease was primarily related to the construction of additional distribution facilities in 2014 to support our ongoing store growth partially offset by an increase in the number of new store openings in 2015 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures total capital expenditures were 430 million  and 396 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively and the increase was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased new stores opened in 2014 as compared to 2013 as well as an increase in the number of new store openings in 2014 

we opened 205  200  and 190  net new stores in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we plan to open 210  net new stores in 2016  the current costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition building improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 15 million  to 18 million  however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2015 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of longterm senior notes during 2013 partially offset by a smaller impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2014 

unsecured revolving credit facility 

on january 14 2011  we entered into a credit agreement as amended by amendment no 1 dated as of september 9 2011  and as further amended by amendment no 2 dated as of july 2 2013  and further amended by amendment no 3 dated as of june 18 2015  the credit agreement the credit agreement provides for a 600 million  unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility arranged by bank of america na which is scheduled to mature in july 2018  the credit agreement includes a 200 million  sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 75 million  sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility we may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 200 million  

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had outstanding letters of credit primarily to support obligations related to workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amounts of 38 million  and 48 million  respectively reducing the aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility by those amounts as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had no  outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

senior notes 

we have issued 14 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due between january 2021  and june 2023  with united missouri bank na as trustee interest on the senior notes ranging from 3800  to 4875  is payable semiannually and is computed on the basis of a 360 day year

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes 

the credit agreement contains certain covenants including limitations on indebtedness a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 250  times and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 300  times the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and noncash sharebased compensation expense ebitdar adjusted debt includes outstanding debt outstanding standby letters of credit and similar instruments sixtimes rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of longterm debt in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement certain actions may be taken including but not limited to possible termination of commitments immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the credit agreement and litigation from our lenders we had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 599  times and 536  times as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and a consolidated leverage ratio of 152  times and 172  times as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements under our current financing plan we have targeted an adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio range of 200  times to 225  times 

the table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  dollars in thousands 



 

free cash flow the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material 

limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the tables above a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

share repurchase program 

in january of 2011 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under the program we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices based on a variety of factors such as price corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions our board of directors may increase or otherwise modify renew suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice as announced on february 4 2015 may 29 2015 and february 10 2016 our board of directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional 500 million  500 million  and 750 million  respectively resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of 625 billion  each additional authorization is effective for a three year period beginning on its respective announcement date 

the following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program in thousands except per share data 



as of december 31 2015  we had 143 million  remaining under our share repurchase program subsequent to the end of the year and through february 26 2016  we repurchased an additional 08 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of 24761  for a total investment of 202 million  we have repurchased a total of 52 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of 2011 and through february 26 2016  at an average price of 10676  for a total aggregate investment of 556 billion  as of february 26 2016  we had approximately 692 million  remaining under our share repurchase program 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other longterm liabilities which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 6 leasing note 9 sharebased compensation and benefit plans and note 10 commitments to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

deferred income taxes as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitments cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2016  which are included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 12 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2015  we recorded a net liability of 44 million  related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of other liabilities 

we record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the companys nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is fully disclosed in note 9 sharebased compensation and benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements this estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined as of december 31 2015  we recorded a liability of 17 million  related to this uncertain liability on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of other liabilities 

the following table identifies the estimated payments of the companys contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  in thousands 



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we historically utilized various offbalance sheet financial instruments including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five  years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million  sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 38 million  and 48 million  were outstanding at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources see contractual obligations section of item 7 of this annual report on form 10k and note 6 leasing to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our operating leases 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

 inventory which consists of automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and tools is stated at the lower of cost or market the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and accordingly have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate at a given point in time the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods ultimately our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if the shrink reserve changed 10  from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2015  the financial impact would have been approximately 1 million  or 01  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2015  

 we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values as part of the evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset the estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting longterm estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact our impairment assessment 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have never recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 2015  nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of oreilly stock which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10  from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not  have changed and no further steps would have been required 

 we receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements including cooperative advertising allowances for warranties merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates cooperative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred all other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations based on our historical results and current assessment we have not  recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements and we do not  believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations the eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

 we offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties the risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims for this merchandise when sold we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales estimated warranty costs which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims if warranty reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2015  the financial impact would have been approximately 4 million  or 02  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2015  

 we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation general liability vehicle liability property loss and team member health care benefits with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities employment related claims and litigation certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation general liability vehicle liability or property loss claim when estimating our selfinsurance liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience and trendlines projected medical and legal inflation and growth patterns and exposure forecasts the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations our calculation of selfinsurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates which may result in material losses or gains as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods we adjust our selfinsurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value using a creditadjusted discount rate these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities if selfinsurance reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2015  the financial impact would have been approximately 13 million  or 09  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2015  

 we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which oreilly is currently involved we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business management with the assistance of outside legal counsel must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures if legal reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2015  the financial impact would have been approximately 5 million  or 03  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2015  

 we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions andor changes in tax regulations in managements opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates alternatively we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able 

to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

 item 1 business 

general information 

oreilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries collectively we oreilly or the company is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself diy and professional service provider customers our dual market strategy the business was founded in 1957 by charles f oreilly and his son charles h chub oreilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri our common stock has traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol orly since april 22 1993 

  

at december 31 2014  we operated 4366  stores in 43  states our stores carry an extensive product line including the products identified below 

 

our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers such as those identified below 

 

see the risk factors section of item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others deteriorating economic conditions competition in the automotive aftermarket business our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions future growth assurance our dependence upon key and other personnel our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products our acquisition strategies complications in our distribution centers dcs failure to achieve high levels of services and products unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock our increased debt levels a downgrade in our credit ratings data security and environmental legislation and other regulations 

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core oreilly values including customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing superior customer service and significant value to both diy and professional service provider customers 

competitive advantages 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution systems and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

for more than 35 years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers 

in 2014  we derived approximately 58  of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 42  of our sales from our professional service provider customers we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation the opportunities for growth in our less mature markets and our systems knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket supported by our approximately 700  fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business over our competitors who do not have the same historical track record of serving the professional service provider we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on the growth of our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each oreilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below 

 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 26  regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 146000  stock keeping units skus many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust dc network we operate 283  hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 41000  skus to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to promote from within and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 166  professionals who average 18  years of service 228  corporate managers who average 16  years of service and 429  district managers who average 12  years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 22 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2014  we opened 200  net new stores and we plan to open approximately 205  net new stores in 2015  which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new stores by i constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store or iii purchasing multistore chains new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts number and type of existing automotive repair facilities competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently and proficiently than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 2014  we relocated 29  stores and renovated 58  stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth 

in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

continually enhance the growth and functionality of our ecommerce website 

our userfriendly website wwworeillyautocom  allows our customers to search product and repair content check the instore availability of our products and place orders for either home delivery or instore pickup we continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience as well as a robust product and repair content information resource which will continue to build the oreilly brand 

team members 

as of january 31 2015  we employed 67926  team members  33779  fulltime team members and 34147  parttime team members of whom 57887  were employed at our stores 7085  were employed at our dcs and 2954  were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 50  stores  569  team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years in addition approximately 61  team members who drive overtheroad trucks in two  of our dcs are represented by a labor union except for these team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition for 58 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our live green culture which emphasizes the importance of each team members contribution to the success of oreilly this focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

store network 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are identified below 

 

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our stores on average carry approximately 23000  skus and average approximately 7200  total square feet in size at december 31 2014  we had a total of approximately 32 million  square feet in our 4366  stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 146000  skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 283  hub stores which on average carry approximately 41000  skus and average approximately 10000  square feet in size 

we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2014  and 2013  



store layout 

we utilize a computerassisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent retail merchandise presentation and customize our hardparts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each stores geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation 

to enhance storelevel operations customer service and reliability we use linux servers and ibm iseries computer systems in our stores these systems are linked with the iseries computers located in each of our dcs our pointofsale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog part images schematics and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and uses barcode scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customers checkout time ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 429  district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten  stores which provides our stores with a strong amount of operational support 

store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a weeklong manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri store and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments field workshops regional meetings and our annual managers conference 

we provide financial incentives to all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability in addition each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their stores performance we believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers therefore our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from professional parts people particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the oreilly certified parts professional test passing the oreilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager afterward these team members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

distribution systems 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory moreover we believe the ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc 

network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each dc as of december 31 2014  we had a total growth capacity of over 800  stores in our distribution center network 

distribution centers 

as of december 31 2014  we operated 26  dcs comprised of approximately 100 million  operating square feet see the properties table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of dc operating square footages our dcs electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores our dcs stock an average of 146000  skus and most dcs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional dcs onhand inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within an individual dcs metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the dcs city counter most of which receive this service seven days per week our dcs also provide weekend service not only to stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic hub locations which redistribute to surrounding stores our national hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2015  we plan to 

 

hub stores 

we currently operate 283  strategically located hub stores in addition to serving diy and professional service provider customers in their markets hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of skus on a sameday basis our hub stores average approximately 10000  square feet and carry an average of 41000  skus 

products and purchasing 

our stores offer diy and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name house brands and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco armor all bosch bwd cardone castrol gates rubber monroe moog pennzoil prestone quaker state stp turtle wax valvoline wagner and wix in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality proprietary private label products under our besttest® brakebest® import direct® master pro® microgard® murray® omnispark® oreilly auto parts® precision® power torque® super start® and ultima® brands our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value – a characteristic important to our diy customers 

we have no longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our suppliers nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers we have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500  suppliers the five largest of which accounted for approximately 23  of our total purchases in 2014  our largest supplier in 2014  accounted for approximately 6  of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3  to 5  of our total purchases 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer 

we use an integrated marketing program which includes radio direct mail and newspaper distribution instore online and social media promotions and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the oreilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination 

of brand product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events we also utilize a problemresolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles protecting their longterm automotive investment and establishing oreilly as their partner for auto parts needs 

to stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 1300  grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 42  states during 2014  we were the title sponsor of two  national association for stock car racing nascar national series events in texas and three  national hot rod association nhra races across the country 

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association ncaa basketball our relationships with over 30  ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed oreilly logos on tvvisible signs throughout the season 

we target spanish speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of spanish language radio print and outdoor advertising as well as sponsorships of over 45  local and regional festivals and events 

as consumers increasingly turn to the internet for information and offers we continue to invest in digital channels to expand the oreilly brand presence online and through mobile devices search engine optimization strategies are used to drive traffic to our website and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers 

in 2014 we continued our oreilly orewards® diy customer loyalty program with a total of over 12 million  customers enrolled the program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores the programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business and target promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns 

marketing to the professional service provider customer 

we have approximately 700  fulltime oreilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our first call® program each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industryleading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below 

 

marketing to the independently owned parts store 

along with the daily operation and management of the dcs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our wholly owned subsidiary ozark also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores jobber stores throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an oreilly store ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores 

we currently provide automotive products to approximately 181  jobber stores who participate in our proprietary jobber service program called parts city auto parts program with total annual sales of approximately 60 million  as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of trademarked logo that is owned by ozark in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

pricing 

we believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets with additional savings offered on some items through volume discounts and special promotional pricing and competitor price comparisons consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area 

customer payments and returns policy 

our stores accept cash checks debit and credit cards we also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our preestablished credit requirements some of the factors considered in our preestablished credit requirements include customer creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms no customer accounted for greater than one  percent of our consolidated net sales nor do we have any dependence on any single customer 

we accept product returns for new products core products and warrantydefective products 

industry environment 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 246 billion  according to the auto care association this market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales oreillys addressable market within this industry is approximately 140 billion  which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and diy sales we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations 

competition 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with the stores identified below 

 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital to support such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty suppliers the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into supplierprovided containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty suppliers in general our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the supplier 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date however we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities also the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the competition section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2015  and beyond will be achieved failure 

to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the growth strategy section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the business section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers dcs or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of acquired businesses will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs 

credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our credit facility a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flows 

a breach of customer team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team members we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations and employment laws and regulations may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices 

our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment laws andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the enacted patient protection and affordable care act as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by congress and state legislatures significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcarerelated expenses we continue to evaluate potential additional impacts the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impact including potential further modifications to our current benefit plans operational changes to minimize the effect of the legislation on our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcarerelated expenses if we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted

 item 2 properties 

distribution centers stores and other properties 

as of december 31 2014  we operated 26  regional distribution centers dcs of which eight  were leased  28 million  operating square footage and 18  were owned  72 million  operating square footage for total dc operating square footage of 100 million  square feet the following table provides information regarding our dcs returns facility and corporate offices as of december 31 2014  



 

the leased facilities typically require a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and have an original term of at a minimum 20 years subject to one fiveyear renewal at our option one  of our bulk facilities is leased from an entity owned by an affiliated directors immediate family this lease requires payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and 

maintenance expenses and an original term of 15 years subject to three fiveyear renewals at our option we believe that this lease agreement with the affiliated entity is on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

of the 4366  stores that we operated at december 31 2014  1612  stores were owned 2677  stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 77  stores were leased from entities in which certain of our affiliated directors members of our affiliated directors immediate family or our executive officers are affiliated leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with three  of the eight  affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from november 30 2016  to september 30 2031  we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

we believe that our present facilities are in good condition are adequately insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations the store servicing capability of our 26  existing dcs is approximately 5200  stores providing a growth capacity of more than 800  stores we believe the growth capacity in our 26  existing dcs will provide us with the dc infrastructure needed for nearterm expansion however as we expand our geographic footprint we will continue to evaluate our existing distribution system infrastructure and will adjust our distribution system capacity as needed to support our future growth 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

oreilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the companys business the company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss the company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters although the company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters it does not currently believe that in the aggregate these matters taking into account applicable insurance and reserves will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period 

the company received a subpoena from the district attorney of the county of alameda along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in the state of california seeking documents and information related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste management has an ongoing and open dialogue with these agencies regarding this matter and is cooperating fully with the request however at this time a prediction of the ultimate outcome of these efforts cannot be determined 

in addition oreilly was involved in resolving governmental investigations that were being conducted against csk auto corporation csk and csks former officers and other litigation prior to its acquisition by oreilly in 2008 as described below as previously reported all governmental investigations and litigation related to these csk legacy issues both civil and criminal have concluded however under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements csk may have certain indemnification obligations as a result of the csk acquisition oreilly has incurred legal fees and costs related to these potential indemnification obligations arising from the litigation commenced by the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission against csks former employees whether those legal fees and costs are covered by csks insurance is subject to uncertainty and given its complexity and scope the final outcome cannot be predicted at this time oreilly has a remaining reserve with respect to the indemnification obligations of 12 million  at december 31 2014  which relates to the payment of those legal fees and costs already incurred it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the companys results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by resolution of such matter depending in part upon the results of operations and cash flows for such period however at this time management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter after consideration of applicable reserves should not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

key events and recent developments   

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below 

 24 

2018 as of february 27 2015 the company had repurchased approximately 465 million  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 42 billion  under this program 

results of operations 

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



2014  compared to 2013   

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2014  increased 567 million  to 722 billion  from 665 billion  for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 9  comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 60  and 43  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2014  in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our regional distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2014  was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both diy and professional service provider customers the improvements in average ticket values were the result 

of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales the overall growth in our hard part categories continues to be driven by our faster growing professional service provider sales which are primarily comprised of hard part categories and by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles these vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time however when repairs are required the cost of the replacement parts is on average greater while the less frequent repairs required by these better engineered and manufactured vehicles does create pressure on transaction counts both diy and professional service provider customer transaction counts were positive for the year ended december 31 2014 the increases in professional service provider customer transaction counts were primarily driven by our acquired markets and the continued growth of less mature stores the increases in diy transaction counts were driven by our ongoing focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our diy customers during high diy traffic periods including nights and weekends 

we opened 200  net new stores during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 190  net new stores for the year ended december 31 2013  at december 31 2014  we operated 4366  stores in 43  states compared to 4166  stores in 42  states at december 31 2013  we anticipate total new store growth to increase to 205  net new store openings in 2015  

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2014  increased to 371 billion  or 514  of sales from 337 billion  or 507  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 10  the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements partially offset by the noncash lastin firstout lifo negative impact resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs during the third quarter of 2013 we fully depleted our lifo reserve due to acquisition cost improvements we realized over time our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost during the year ended december 31 2014 our lifo cost was written down by approximately 41 million to reflect replacement cost 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses sga for the year ended december 31 2014  increased to 244 billion  or 338  of sales from 227 billion  or 341  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 8  the increase in total sga dollars was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2014  increased to 127 billion  or 176  of sales from 110 billion  or 166  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 15  

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2014  increased to 48 million  or 07  of sales from 45 million  or 07  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 8  the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014  increased to 444 million   363  effective tax rate from 389 million   367  effective tax rate for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 14  the increase in our provision for income taxes was the result of higher taxable income in the current year driven by our strong operating results the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increased benefits from employment tax credits in the current year 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2014  increased to 778 million  or 108  of sales from 670 million  or 101  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 16  

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2014  increased 22  to 734  on 106 million  shares from 603  on 111 million  shares for the same period one year ago 

2013  compared to 2012   

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 467 million to 665 billion from 618 billion for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 8 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 43 and 38 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales from the vip parts tires  service vip stores acquired on december 31 2012 due to the significant change in the business model and lack of historical data 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2013 in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability including same day and overnight access to inventory in our distribution centers enhanced services and programs offered in our stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provided incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2013 was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both diy and professional service provider business and an increase in customer transaction counts for professional service provider business slightly offset by a small decrease in customer transaction counts for diy business the improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales the overall growth in the hard part categories continues to be driven by the increasing cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles these vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time however when repairs are required the cost of the replacement parts is on average greater both diy and professional service provider customer transaction counts are negatively impacted by these less frequent repairs the increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts were driven by the chain wide growth of our professional business while macroeconomic pressures on disposable income continue to negatively impact diy customer transaction counts 

we opened 190 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 180 net new stores and 56 acquired stores for the year ended december 31 2012 at december 31 2013 we operated 4166 stores in 42 states compared to 3976 stores in 42 states at december 31 2012 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to 337 billion or 507 of sales from 310 billion or 501 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 9 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to acquisition cost improvements improved inventory shrinkage and distribution system efficiencies partially offset by a smaller amount of capitalized distribution costs for the year ended december 31 2013 the noncash negative impact to gross margin resulting from the depletion of lifo reserve and the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix acquisition cost improvements were the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs the improved inventory shrinkage was driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through 

our distribution and store networks distribution system efficiencies were the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced dc team members in our maturing dcs the decrease in capitalized distribution costs for the year ended december 31 2013 was the result of the larger than typical benefit from capitalized distribution costs in 2012 associated with our initiative to increase our storelevel inventories the costs to move this additional inventory into the stores in 2012 were more efficient than routine restocking activity as a result we realized a larger than normal benefit from capitalized distribution costs the complete depletion of our lifo reserve during the year resulted from the acquisition cost improvements we realized over time our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we began effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost in 2013 during 2013 our lifo cost was written down by approximately 216 million to reflect replacement cost in 2013 professional service provider sales grew at a faster rate than diy sales and professional service provider sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than diy sales as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers therefore outsized growth in professional service provider sales as compared to diy creates pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses sga for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to 227 billion or 341 of sales from 212 billion or 343 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 7 the increase in total sga dollars was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of improved leverage of store payroll and occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to 110 billion or 166 of sales from 977 million or 158 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 13 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to 45 million or 07 of sales from 36 million or 06 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 24 the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was primarily due to increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to 389 million 367 effective tax rate from 356 million 378 effective tax rate for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 9 the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits of employment tax credits realized in 2013 adjustments to tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits during 2013 and unfavorable adjustments relating to certain income tax audits in 2012 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to 670 million or 101 of sales from 586 million or 95 of sales for the same period one year prior representing an increase of 14 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 27 to 603 on 111 million shares from 475 on 123 million shares for the same period one year prior 

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2014  and 2013  dollars in millions   



 

current assets increased 8  and current liabilities increased 17  from 2013  to 2014  the increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory resulting from the opening of 200 net new stores the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our enhanced supplier financing program during the year which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 946  as of december 31 2014  as compared to 866  in the prior year 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in thousands 



 

operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily due to a greater decrease in net inventory investment and larger increases in net income and accrued payrollrelated liabilities in 2014 as compared to 2013 net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs our supplier financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 946  866  and 847  as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2014 was driven by continued strong supplier support the increase in accrued payrollrelated liabilities during 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates and timing of payments for employer obligations under certain benefit plans 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2013  compared to 2012  was primarily due to a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a smaller increase in income taxes payable offset in part by an increase in net income for the year our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 866 847 and 644 at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2013 is the result of a smaller increase in the number of new suppliers added to our financing programs versus the prior year we launched our enhanced supplier financing program in january of 2011 and were able to add a large number of suppliers to the program during 2011 and 2012 the smaller increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of a prepaid tax position at the beginning of 2012 versus a payable position at the beginning of 2013 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during 2014 related to the mix of owned versus leased new stores as compared to the prior year as well as an increase in the number of new store openings total capital expenditures were 430 million  and 396 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2013  compared to 2012  was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during 2013 related to the purchase and construction of new distribution facilities during 2013 to support our ongoing store growth as well as an increase in the number of new store openings total capital expenditures were 396 million  and 301 million  in 2013  and 2012  respectively 

we opened 200  190  and 180  net new stores in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively and acquired 56 stores in 2012 we plan to open 205  net new stores in 2015  the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition building improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 13 million  to 15 million  however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of longterm senior notes during 2013 partially offset by the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during the current year under our share repurchase program 

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013  compared to 2012  was primarily attributable to the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during 2013 under our share repurchase program

on january 14 2011 we entered into a credit agreement as amended by amendment no 1 dated as of september 9 2011 and as further amended by amendment no 2 dated as of july 2 2013 the credit agreement the credit agreement provides for a 600 million  unsecured revolving credit facility revolving credit facility arranged by bank of america na which is scheduled to mature in july of 2018 the credit agreement includes a 200 million  sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 75 million  sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility we may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 200 million  we had outstanding letters of credit primarily to support obligations related to workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amount of 48 million  and 52 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively reducing the aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility by those amounts as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had no  outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions

free cash flow the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the tables above a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

share repurchase program 

under our share repurchase program as approved by our board of directors we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices based on a variety of factors such as price corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions we may increase or otherwise modify renew suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice as announced on february 5 2014 august 13 2014 and 

february 4 2015 our board of directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional 500 million  resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of 50 billion  each additional 500 million authorization is effective for a three year period beginning on their respective announcement date 

the following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program in thousands except per share data 



as of december 31 2014  we had 279 million  remaining under our share repurchase program subsequent to the end of the year and through february 27 2015  we repurchased an additional 01 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of 19748  for a total investment of 28 million  we have repurchased a total of 46 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of 2011 and through february 27 2015  at an average price of 9138  for a total aggregate investment of 42 billion  as of february 27 2015  we had approximately 752 million  remaining under our share repurchase program 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other longterm liabilities which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 6 leasing note 9 sharebased compensation and benefit plans and note 10 commitments to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

deferred income taxes as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitments cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2015  which are included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 13 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the realized deferred income taxes ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2014  we recorded a net liability of 58 million  related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of other liabilities

the base rate in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by moodys investor service inc and standard  poors rating services subject to limited exceptions swing line loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin described above in addition we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments varying from 0125  to 0250  per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by moodys investor service inc and standard  poors rating services subject to limited exceptions based on our credit ratings at december 31 2014 our margin for base rate loans was 0000  our margin for eurodollar rate loans was 0975  and our facility fee was 0150  as of december 31 2014  we had no  outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility based upon our current credit ratings our current margin for base rate loans is 0000  our margin for eurodollar rate loans is 0875  and our facility fee is 0125    

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we historically utilized various offbalance sheet financial instruments including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million  sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 48 million  and 52 million  were outstanding at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources see contractual obligations and note 10 commitments to the consolidated financial statements for information on our operating leases 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

 

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if the shrink reserve changed 10  from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2014  the financial impact would have been approximately 1 million  or 01  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2014  

 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have never recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 2014  nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of oreilly stock which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10  from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 

 

 

 34 

a number of factors including historical claims experience and trendlines projected medical and legal inflation and growth patterns and exposure forecasts the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations our calculation of selfinsurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates which may result in material losses or gains as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods we adjust our selfinsurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value using a creditadjusted discount rate these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities if selfinsurance reserves were changed 10  from our estimated reserves at december 31 2014  the financial impact would have been approximately 12 million  or 10  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2014  

 

 

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

quarterly results 

the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2014  and 2013  the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown the unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report and the other financial information included therein

 item 1 business 

general information 

oreilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries collectively “we” “o’reilly” or the “company” is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself “diy” and professional service provider customers our “dual market strategy” the business was founded in 1957 by charles f oreilly and his son charles h chub oreilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri our common stock has traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “orly” since april 22 1993 

  

at december 31 2013 we operated 4166  stores in 42  states our stores carry an extensive product line including the products identified below 

 

our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers such as those identified below 

 

see risk factors beginning on page 15 for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others deteriorating economic conditions competition in the automotive aftermarket business our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions future growth assurance our dependence upon key and other personnel our relationships with key vendors and availability of key products our acquisition strategies complications in our distribution centers “dc”s failure to achieve high levels of services and products the effect of sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock increased debt levels a downgrade in our credit ratings data security and environmental legislation and other regulations 

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values including customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing superior customer service and significant value to both diy and professional service provider customers 

competitive advantages 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service technically proficient store personnel strategic distribution systems and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated 

proven ability to execute our dual market strategy 

over the past 30 years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers 

in 2013 we derived approximately 58  of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 42  of our sales from our professional service provider customers we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to diy customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation the opportunities for growth in our less mature markets and our systems knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket supported by 600  fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business over our competitors who do not have the same historical track record of serving the professional service provider we will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on the growth of our diy business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy 

superior customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each oreilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backorders for the products we sell 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below 

 

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 24  regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 147000  stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust dc network we operate 266  hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 43000  skus to other stores within the surrounding area we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 166  professionals who average 18  years of service 210  corporate managers who average 16  years of service and 404  district managers who average 12  years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 21 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2013 we opened 190  net new stores and we plan to open approximately 200  net new stores in 2014 which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new stores by i constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store or iii purchasing multistore chains new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts number and type of existing automotive repair facilities competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket therefore we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently and proficiently than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance during 2013 we relocated 19  stores and renovated 57  stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth 

in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers

store network 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our stores on average carry approximately 24000  skus and average approximately 7000  total square feet in size at december 31 2013 we had a total of approximately 30 million  square feet in our 4166  stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 147000  skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 266  hub stores which on average carry approximately 43000  skus and average approximately 10000  square feet in size 

we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2013 and 2012 



store layout 

we utilize a computerassisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent retail merchandise presentation and customize our hardparts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation 

to enhance storelevel operations customer service and reliability we use linux servers and ibm iseries computer systems in our stores these systems are linked with the iseries computers located in each of our dcs our pointofsale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog part images schematics and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and uses barcode scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are identified below 

 

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas as these store clusters mature we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 404  district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten  stores which provides our stores with a strong amount of operational support 

store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a weeklong manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri store and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments field workshops regional meetings and our annual managers conference 

we provide financial incentives to all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual andor store sales and profitability in addition each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store’s performance we believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers because a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that 

the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from a professional parts person particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager afterward these team members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

distribution systems 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory moreover we believe the ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each dc as of december 31 2013 we had a total growth capacity of over 225  stores in our distribution center network which increased by 300  stores with the completion of our lakeland florida dc in january of 2014 and will increase by 250  stores with the completion of our chicago illinois dc in the second half of 2014 and 210  net stores with the relocation of our existing lewiston maine dc to a facility in devens massachusetts in the second half of 2014 including this planned growth we expect to end the year in 2014 with a total growth capacity in our distribution system of over 750  stores 

distribution centers 

as of december 31 2013 we operated 24  dcs comprised of approximately 86 million  operating square feet see the properties table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of dc operating square footages our dcs electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores our dcs stock an average of 147000  skus and most dcs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional dcs’ onhand inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within an individual dcs metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the dcs “city counter” most of which receive this service seven days per week our dcs also provide weekend service not only to stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic hub locations which redistribute to surrounding stores our national hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores with our planned dc expansion during 2014 we expect to end the year in 2014 operating 26  dcs comprised of approximately 99 million  operating square feet 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2014 we plan to 

 

hub stores 

we currently operate 266  strategically located hub stores in addition to serving diy and professional service provider customers in their markets hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of skus on a sameday basis our hub stores average approximately 10000  square feet and carry an average of 43000  skus 

products and purchasing 

our stores offer diy and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name house brands and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco armor all bosch bwd cardone castrol gates rubber monroe moog pennzoil prestone quaker state stp turtle wax valvoline wagner and wix in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality house brands and private label products under our besttest® brakebest® import direct® master pro® microgard® murray® omnispark® o’reilly auto parts® precision® power torque® super start® and ultima® brands our house brand and private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value – a characteristic important to our diy customers 

we have no longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors again in 2013 we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500  vendors the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24  of our total purchases in 2013 our largest vendor in 2013 accounted for approximately 7  of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately 3  to 6  of our total purchases 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer 

we use an integrated marketing program which includes television radio direct mail and newspaper distribution instore online and social media promotions and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the o’reilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand and productprice messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events 

to stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 1500  grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 42  states during 2013 we were the title sponsor of two  national association for stock car racing “nascar” national series events in texas and four  national hot rod association “nhra” races across the country 

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” basketball our relationships with over 30  ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominentlydisplayed o’reilly logos on tvvisible signs throughout the season 

through an expanded use of spanish language radio print and outdoor advertising as well as sponsorships of over 45  local and regional festivals and events we demonstrated our commitment to increasing marketing efforts that are targeted toward the spanish speaking auto parts consumer 

in 2013 we continued our dedicated problemsolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the long term this highly relevant message resonates with consumers and establishes o’reilly as their source for the parts they need and excellent customer service 

in 2013 we launched our o’reilly o’rewards® diy customer loyalty program the program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores the programs allow us to enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business and target promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns while also rewarding our customers for their continued business 

marketing to the professional service provider customer 

we have over 600  fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our first call® program each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industryleading first call program enables our sales representatives 

district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below 

 

marketing to the independently owned parts store 

along with the daily operation and management of the dcs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our wholly owned subsidiary “ozark” also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores “jobber stores” throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an oreilly store ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores 

approximately 181  jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from ozark and participate in our parts city auto parts program our proprietary jobber service program as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of trademarked logo that is owned by ozark in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

pricing 

we believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area 

customer payments and returns policy 

our stores accept cash checks debit and credit cards we also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our preestablished credit requirements some of the factors considered in our preestablished credit requirements include customer creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms no customer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated net sales nor do we have any dependence on any single customer 

we accept product returns for new products core products and warrantydefective products 

industry environment 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately 239 billion  according to the automotive aftermarket industry association “aaia” this market is made up of four segments – labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately 136 billion  which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and diy sales we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations 

competition 

the sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas including customer service product availability store location brand recognition and price we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with the stores identified below 

 

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital to support such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into vendorsupplied containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty vendors in general our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the vendor 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date however we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in recent years worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions including the united states and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles in the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities also the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2014 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers “dcs” or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business 

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members 

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

all of the shares of our common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amended subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any that future sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of acquired businesses will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our stock price would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have in place an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 16 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative and negative covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive vendor financing programs 

credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital these ratings are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our vendor financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our vendor financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flow 

a breach of customer team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team members we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

litigation governmental proceedings environmental legislation and regulations and employment laws and regulations may affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

environmental legislation and regulations like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs by among other things increasing fuel prices 

our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in employment laws andor regulations could hinder our ability to control costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the enacted patient protection and affordable care act as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by congress and state legislatures significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcarerelated expenses we are currently evaluating the potential additional impact the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impact including potential further modifications to our current benefit plans operational changes to minimize the effect of the legislation on our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcarerelated expenses if we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted

 item 2 properties 

distribution centers stores and other properties 

as of december 31 2013 we operated 24  regional distribution centers “dc”s of which nine  were leased  29 million  operating square footage and 15  were owned  57 million  operating square footage for total dc operating square footage of 86 million  square feet the following table provides information regarding our dcs returns facilities and corporate offices as of december 31 2013 



 

the leased facilities typically require a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expense and have an original term of at a minimum 20 years subject to one fiveyear renewal at our option one of our bulk facilities is leased from an entity owned 

by an affiliated director’s immediate family this lease requires payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of 15 years subject to three fiveyear renewals at our option we believe that this lease agreement with the affiliated entity is on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

of the 4166  stores that we operated at december 31 2013 1469  stores were owned 2620  stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 77  stores were leased from entities in which certain of our affiliated directors members of our affiliated director’s immediate family or our executive officers are affiliated leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with three  of the eight  affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from april 30 2014  to september 30 2031  we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

we believe that our present facilities are in good condition are adequately insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations the store servicing capability of our 24  existing dcs is approximately 4400  stores providing a growth capacity of more than 225  stores which increased by 300  stores with the completion of our lakeland florida dc in january of 2014 and will increase by 250  stores with the completion of our chicago illinois dc and 210 stores with the completion of our devens massachusetts dc both of which are expected to open in the second half of 2014 we believe the growth capacity in our 24  existing dcs along with the additional capacity of our new lakeland chicago and devens dcs will provide us with the dc infrastructure needed for nearterm expansion however as we expand our geographic footprint we will continue to evaluate our existing distribution system infrastructure and will adjust our distribution system capacity as needed to support our future growth 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

o’reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the company’s business the company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss the company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters although the company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters it does not currently believe that in the aggregate these matters taking into account applicable insurance and reserves will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period 

in addition o’reilly was involved in resolving governmental investigations that were being conducted against csk auto corporation csk and csk’s former officers and other litigation prior to its acquisition by o’reilly in 2008 as described below 

as previously reported the governmental investigations of csk regarding its legacy preacquisition accounting practices have concluded all criminal charges against former employees of csk related to its legacy preacquisition accounting practices as well as the civil litigation filed against csk’s former chief executive officer by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” have concluded 

under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements csk may have certain indemnification obligations as a result of the csk acquisition o’reilly has incurred legal fees and costs related to these potential indemnification obligations arising from the litigation commenced by the department of justice and sec against csk’s former employees whether those legal fees and costs are covered by csk’s insurance is subject to uncertainty and given its complexity and scope the final outcome cannot be predicted at this time o’reilly has a remaining reserve with respect to the indemnification obligations of 134 million  at december 31 2013 which relates to the payment of those legal fees and costs already incurred it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the company’s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by resolution of such matter depending in part upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period however at this time management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter after consideration of applicable reserves should not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

in management’s discussion and analysis we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results including 

 

the review of management’s discussion and analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements related notes and other financial information forwardlooking statements and risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report

overview 

we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states we are one of the largest us automotive aftermarket specialty retailers selling our products to both doityourself “diy” customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy” our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects “good” “better” and “best” alternatives our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers used oil oil filter and battery recycling battery wiper and bulb replacement battery diagnostic testing electrical and module testing check engine light code extraction loaner tool program drum and rotor resurfacing custom hydraulic hoses professional paint shop mixing and related materials and machine shops as of december 31 2013 we operated 4166  stores in 42  states 

operating within the retail industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer preferences and spending habits and competition the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact o’reilly and the retail sector in general we believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “trade down” to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions we have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences however we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of “purchasing up” on the value spectrum 

we believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers’ willingness to return to “purchasing up” on the value spectrum in the future as the us economy recovers however we cannot predict whether when or the manner in which these economic conditions will change 

we believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles new light vehicle registrations average vehicle age and unemployment 

 

we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service 

key events and recent developments   

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below 

 25 

their respective announcement dates as of february 28 2014 we had repurchased approximately 406 million  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of  34 billion  under this program 

 

results of operations 

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 



2013 compared to 2012 

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2013 increased  467 million  to  665 billion  from  618 billion  for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 8  comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 43  and 38  for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales from the vip parts tires  service vip stores acquired on december 31 2012 due to the significant change in the business model and lack of historical data 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2013 in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our welltrained and technically proficient team members superior inventory availability enhanced services and programs offered in most stores a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2013 was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both diy and commercial business and an increase in customer transaction counts for commercial business slightly offset by a small decrease in customer transaction counts for diy business the improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales the growth in the hard part categories was driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in diy hard part sales as consumers continue to maintain and repair their existing vehicles the increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts were driven by the chainwide growth of our professional business while macroeconomic pressures on disposable income continue to negatively impact diy customer transaction counts both diy and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by betterengineered and more technically advanced vehicles which have been manufactured in recent years these vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time however when repairs are required the cost of the repair is on average greater 

we opened 190  net new stores during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 180 net new stores and 56 acquired stores for the year ended december 31 2012 at december 31 2013 we operated 4166  stores in 42  states compared to 3976 stores in 42 states at december 31 2012 we anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 200  net new stores in 2014 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to  337 billion  or 507  of sales from  310 billion  or 501  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 9  the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to acquisition cost improvements improved inventory shrinkage and distribution system efficiencies partially offset by a smaller amount of capitalized distribution costs in the current year the noncash impact to gross margin resulting from the depletion of our lastin firstout lifo reserve and the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of our total sales mix acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs the improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks distribution system efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced dc team members in our maturing dcs the decrease in capitalized distribution costs in the current year is the result of the larger than typical benefit from capitalized distribution costs in the prior year associated with our initiative to increase our storelevel inventories the costs to move this additional inventory into the stores in the prior year were more efficient than routine restocking activity as a result we realized a larger than normal benefit from capitalized distribution costs the depletion of our lifo reserve during the year resulted from the acquisition cost improvements we have realized over time the companys policy is not to write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and accordingly we are now effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost during 2013 our lifo cost was written down by approximately 216 million to reflect replacement cost we expect to incur pressure from product acquisition cost reductions in the first quarter of 2014 however at this time we do not anticipate material charges for the last three quarters of 2014 unforeseen significant acquisition cost decreases could occur and may create additional lifo gross margin headwinds during 2014 

commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than diy sales as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers therefore outsized growth as compared to diy creates pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to  227 billion  or 341  of sales from  212 billion  or 343  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 7  the increase in total sga dollars was primarily the result of additional team members facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of improved leverage of store payroll and occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results 

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to  110 billion  or 166  of sales from  977 million  or 158  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 13  

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to  45 million  or 07  of sales from  36 million  or 06  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 24  the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was primarily due to increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to  389 million   367  effective tax rate from  356 million   378  effective tax rate for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 9  the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income the decrease in our tax rate was primarily due to the benefits of employment tax credits realized in the current year adjustments to tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits during the current year and unfavorable adjustments relating to certain income tax audits in the prior year 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to  670 million  or 101  of sales from  586 million  or 95  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 14  

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 27  to  603  on 111 million  shares from  475  on 123 million  shares for the same period one year ago 

2012 compared to 2011 

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 393 million to 618 billion from 579 billion for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 7 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 38 and 46 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2012 in millions 



we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of high levels of customer service superior inventory availability a broader selection of products offered in most stores a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2012 was driven by an increase in average ticket values partially offset by a decrease in diy customer transaction counts the improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales the growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in diy hard part sales as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles the strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts driven by our acquired markets have been offset by pressured diy transaction counts diy customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages both diy and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by betterengineered and more technically advanced vehicles which have been manufactured in recent years these vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time however when repairs are required the cost of the repair is typically greater 

we opened 180 net new stores and acquired 56 stores during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 170 net new stores for the year ended december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 we operated 3976 stores in 42 states compared to 3740 stores in 39 states at december 31 2011 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2012 increased to 310 billion or 501 of sales from 284 billion or 490 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 9 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to dc efficiencies acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix dc efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced dc team members in our maturing dcs in addition during 2012 we increased our storelevel inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels the costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and as a result we realized a onetime benefit from capitalized distribution costs this capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points versus the prior year acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs the improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than diy sales as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers therefore creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2012 increased to 212 billion or 343 of sales from 197 billion or 341 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 7 the increase in total sga dollars was primarily the result of additional employees facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count the slight increase in sga as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our focus on store staffing levels to continue to deliver industryleading customer service while adjusting to the slower sales environment as well as an overall deleverage on soft comparable store sales 

  

operating income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above operating income for the year ended december 31 2012 increased to 977 million or 158 of sales from 867 million or 150 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 13 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased to 36 million or 06 of sales from 51 million or 09 of sales for the same period one year ago representing a decrease of 30 the decrease in total other expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily due to onetime charges related to our financing transactions that were completed in january of 2011 discussed in detail below partially offset by increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as compared to the prior year 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012 increased to 356 million 378 effective tax rate from 308 million 378 effective tax rate for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 15 the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2012 increased to 586 million or 95 of sales from 508 million or 88 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 15 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 28 to 475 on 123 million shares from 371 on 137 million shares for the same period one year ago 

adjustments for nonrecurring and nonoperating events 

our results for the year ended december 31 2011 included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the sec and a former csk officer that resulted in the reimbursement to o’reilly as successor issuer to csk for sec purposes of 3 million 2 million net of tax of incentivebased compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer this “clawback” amount was included in “operating income” on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011 our results for the year ended december 31 2011 also included onetime charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on january 14 2011 the onetime charges included a noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous abl credit facility in the amount of 22 million 13 million net of tax and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of 4 million 3 million net of tax the charges related to our new financing transactions were included in “other income expense” on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011 the results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap measure in the subsequent table 

adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 13 to 977 million or 158 of sales from 864 million or 149 of sales for the same period one year ago adjusted net income for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 12 to 586 million or 95 of sales from 522 million or 90 of sales for the same period one year ago adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 25 to 475 from 381 for the same period one year ago 



the financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts and the former csk officer clawback provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors which is indicative of our core operations we exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information 

is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2013 and 2012 dollars in millions   



  

 

current liabilities increased 7  total debt increased 27  and total equity decreased 7  from 2012 to 2013 the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 866  as of december 31 2013 as compared to 847  one year prior the increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of 300 million of 3850 senior notes due 2023 the decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paidincapital and retained earnings partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in thousands 



 

operating activities 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a smaller increase in income taxes payable offset in part by an increase in net income for the year net inventory 

investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 866  847  and 644 at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2013 is the result of a smaller increase in the number of new vendors added to our financing programs in the current year versus the prior year we launched our enhanced vendor financing program in january of 2011 and were able to add a large number of vendors to the programs during 2011 and 2012 as we anniversary these vendor additions to the programs we expect to see a slower rate of growth in our accounts payable to inventory ratio the smaller increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of a prepaid tax position at the beginning of 2012 versus a payable position at the beginning of 2013 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year adjusted for the effect of noncash depreciation and amortization charges and the onetime noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility in january of 2011 decreases in net inventory and other assets and increases in income taxes payable adjusted for the effect of noncash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised and other current liabilities our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 847 644 and 443 at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the company under various programs the increase in income taxes payable adjusted for the noncash impacts discussed above was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during 2011 the increase in other current liabilities was primarily the result of the payment during 2011 for the onetime monetary penalty to the doj for the legacy csk doj investigation 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during the current year related to the purchase and construction of new distribution facilities during 2013 to support our ongoing store growth the total capital expenditures were 396 million and 301 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2012 partially offset by small acquisitions during the year total capital expenditures were 301 million and 328 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in capital expenditures during 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened we were able to find real estate with attractive lease rates during 2012 and as a result opened a larger number of leased locations during 2012 as compared to the year prior opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location 

we opened 190  180 and 170 net new stores in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and acquired 56 stores in 2012 we plan to open 200  net new stores in 2014 the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately  13 million  to  15 million  however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site 

financing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily attributable to the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during the current year in accordance with our boardapproved share repurchase program 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2012 in accordance with our boardapproved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt during 2011 partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the company’s incentive programs and the related tax benefits during 2012 

credit facilities 

on january 14 2011 we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement for a fiveyear  750 million  unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility arranged by bank of america na and barclays capital originally scheduled to mature in january of 2016 during 2011 we completed our first amendment to the revolving credit facility decreasing the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility to  660 million  extending the maturity date of the credit agreement to september of 2016 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility in conjunction with the first amendment to the revolving credit facility we recognized a onetime charge related to the modification in the amount of  03 million  which is included in “other income expense” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011 in july of 2013 we completed our second amendment to the credit agreement decreasing the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility to  600 million  extending the maturity date on the credit agreement to july of 2018 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility the credit agreement includes a  200 million  sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a  75 million  sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility we may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to  200 million  we had outstanding standby letters of credit primarily to support obligations 

related to workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amount of  52 million  and  57 million  as of december 13 2013 and 2012 respectively reducing the aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility by those amounts as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

on july 11 2008 we entered into a credit agreement for a fiveyear assetbased revolving credit facility the abl credit facility which was scheduled to mature in july of 2013 at december 31 2010 we had outstanding borrowings of 356 million under the abl credit facility of which 106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract all outstanding borrowings under the abl credit facility were repaid and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on january 14 2011 and the abl credit facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4875 senior notes due 2021 as further described below in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility we recognized a onetime noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the abl credit facility in the amount of 22 million and a onetime charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of 4 million which are included in “other income expense” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions

the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with us gaap we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the tables above a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

share repurchase program 

under our share repurchase program as approved by our board of directors we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices based on a variety of factors such as price corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions we may increase or otherwise modify renew suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice during 2013 we announced that our board of directors approved a resolution to increase the cumulative authorization amount by  500 million  which is effective for a threeyear period and 

expires may 29 2016 as of december 31 2013 the cumulative authorization amount under the program was  35 billion  on february 5 2014 we announced that our board of directors approved a resolution to increase the cumulative authorization amount by an additional  500 million  which is effective for a threeyear period and expires february 5 2017 as of february 5 2014 the cumulative authorization amount under the program was  40 billion  

the following table identifies shares of the company’s common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program in thousands except per share data 



as of december 31 2013 we had  146 million  remaining under our share repurchase program subsequent to the end of the year and through february 28 2014 we did not repurchase a material number of shares of our common stock we repurchased a total of 41 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of 2011 and through february 28 2014 at an average price of  8261  for a total aggregate investment of  34 billion  as of february 28 2014 we had approximately  645 million  remaining under our share repurchase program 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 6 “leasing” and note 13 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

deferred income taxes as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2014 which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 



 35 

 

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 16 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2013 we recorded a liability of  59 million  related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of “other liabilities” 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we have historically utilized various offbalance sheet financial instruments including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a  200 million  sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling  52 million  and  57 million  were outstanding at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources see “contractual obligations” and note 13 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements for information on our operating leases 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

 

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory 

balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if unrecorded shrink changed 10  from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2013 the financial impact would have been approximately  1 million  or 01  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2013 

 

 

we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 2013 nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of o’reilly stock which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10  from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able 

to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

quarterly results 

the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2013 and 2012 the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown the unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report and the other financial information included therein 





 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july of 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 “presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” “asu 201311” under asu 201311 an entity is required to present an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets asu 201311 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 we will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending march 31 2014 the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility historically we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates however as of december 31 2013 we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of  140 billion  and  110 billion  as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at  141 billion  and  120 billion  as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively which was determined by reference to quoted market prices 

we invest certain of our excess cash balances in shortterm highlyliquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal as of december 31 2013 our cash and cash equivalents totaled  231 million

our business 

  

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values of customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing superior customer service and significant value to both diy and professional service provider customers 

  

competitive advantages 

  

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service strategic distribution systems and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages that cannot be easily duplicated 

  

proven ability to execute a dual market strategy 

over the past 30 years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy and professional service provider   customers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers 

  

in 2012 we derived approximately 59  of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 41  of our sales from our professional service provider customers prior to the acquisition of csk we derived approximately 50 of our sales from both our diy and professional service provider customers as we continue to grow our commercial business in the acquired csk markets we expect that over time our diy and professional service provider sales mix to approximate historical averages as a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our over 470 fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service provider customers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who continue to derive a higher concentration of their sales from the diy market 

  

superior customer service 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below 

  









  

technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

 

  

strategic regional tiered distribution network 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional  tiered distribution network provides for superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes dcs and hub stores our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 24 regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 142000 stock keeping units “sku”s many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers to augment our robust dc network we operate 240 hub stores that also provide delivery service and sameday access to an average of 42000 skus to other stores within the surrounding area  we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

  

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 146 professionals who average 18 years of service 273 corporate managers who average 15 years of service and   386 district managers who average 13 years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 20 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 

  

growth strategy 

  

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket during 2012 we opened 180 net new stores acquired 56 stores and we plan to open approximately 190 net new stores in 2013 which will increas e our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new stores either by i constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store or iii purchasing multistore chains new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts number and type of existing automotive repair facilities competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors 

  

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket consequently we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

  

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

  

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented we believe the ability of national auto parts chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently and proficiently than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation thus our intention is to continue to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard into new markets 

  

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store 

 

performance during 2012 we relocated 32 stores and renovated 70 stores we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

  

continually enhance the growth and functionality   of our ecommerce w ebsite 

our userfriendly website wwworeillyautocom  allows our customers to search product and repair content check our instore availability of products and place orders for either home delivery or instore pickup we continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience as well as a robust product and repair content information resource that will continue to build the o’reilly brand 

  

team members 

  

as of january 31 2013 we employed 53615 team members 33931 fulltime team members and 19684 parttime team members of whom 45180 were employed at our stores 5937 were employed at our dcs and 2498 were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 49 stores 527 team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years in addition approximately 71 team members who drive overtheroad trucks in two of our dcs are represented by a labor union except for these team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition for 56 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of each team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

  

store network 

  

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our stores on average carry approximately 23500 skus and average approximately 7200 total square feet in size at december 31 2012 we had a total of approximately 29 million square feet in our 3976 stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 142000 skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 240 hub stores which on average carry approximately 42000 skus and average approximately 10000 square feet in size 

  

we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings and prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

  

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2012 and 2011 

  



 

  

store layout 

we utilize a computerassisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent retail merchandise presentation and customize our hardparts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand  seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

  

store automation 

to enhance storelevel operations customer service and reliability we use linux servers and ibm iseries computer systems in our stores these systems are linked with the iseries computers located in each of our dcs our pointofsale system provide s immediate access to our electronic catalog  part images schematics and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and use barcode scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

  

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are identified below 

  

















 



  

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

  

management structure 

  

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 386 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores which provides our stores with a strong amount of operational support 

  

store and d istrict managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a weeklong manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri s tore and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments field workshops and regional meetings 

  

we provide financial incentives to all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon their individual andor store’s sales and profitability in addition each of our district managers participate in our stock option program and store managers may be eligible for a quarterly bonus program based on their store’s performance    we believe that our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

  

professional parts people 

  

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers because a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers our professional parts people are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from a professional parts person particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

  

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase 

  

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with their regional field sales manager afterward these team members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

  

customer service 

  

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each oreilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material back orders for the products we sell 

  

our online ordering service provides enhanced customer service capabilities to our diy and professional service provider customers our program allows customers to view available parts and prices online purchase parts online andor either ship these purchases to their location or have these parts available for pick up in our local store 

  

 

distribution systems 

  

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory moreover we believe that our ongoing significant capital investments made in our dc network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clus ters of stores located in the regions surrounding each dc we currently have a total growth capacity of over 400 stores in our distribu tion center network  which will increase by 300 stores with the completion of our lakeland florida dc in the first quarter of 2014  

  

distribution centers 

we currently operate 24 dcs comprised of approximately 86 million operating square feet see the “properties” table in ite m 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of dc operating square footages our dcs electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores our dcs stock an average of 142000 skus and most dcs are linked to multiple other regional dcs’ inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within a dc metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from our dc “city counters” most of which receive this service seven days per week in addition our hub store network provides additional service throughout the week and on weekends to surrounding stores 

  

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2013 we plan to 

  















  

hub stores 

we currently operate 240 strategically placed hub stores in addition to serving diy and professional service provider customers in their markets hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area access to an expanded selection of skus on a sameday basis our hub stores average approxima tely 10000 square feet and carry an average of 42000 sku s 

  

products and purchasing 

  

our stores offer diy and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name  house brands and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco armor all bosch bwd cardone castrol gates rubber monroe moog pennzoil prestone quaker state stp turtle wax valvoline wagner and wix in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality house brands and private label products under our besttest® brakebest® import direct® master pro® microgard® murray® omnispark® o’reilly auto parts® precision® power torque® super start® and ultima® brands our house brand and private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value – a characteristic important to our diy customers 

  

we have no longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors again in 2012 we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good 

  

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors the five largest of which accounted for approximately 25  of our total purchases in 2012 our largest vendor in 2012 accounted for approximately 8  of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately 3  to 5  of such purchases 

  

  

  

  

 

marketing 

  

marketing to the diy customer 

we use an integrated marketing program which includes television radio direct mail and newspaper distribution instore and online promotions and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the o’reilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand and productprice messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events 

  

to stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 1500 grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 38 states during 2012 we were the title sponsor of two national association for stock car racing “nascar” national series events in texas and five national hot rod association “nhra” races from c alifornia to n orth carolina 

  

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” basketball and the national football league “nfl” our relationships with over 50 ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominentlydisplayed o’reilly logos on tvvisible signs throughout the season 

  

through an expanded use of spanish language radio print and outdoor advertising  as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events we demonstrated our commitment to increasing marketing efforts that are targeted toward the hispanic auto parts consumer 

  

in 2012 we continued our dedicated problemsolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the longterm this highly relevant message resonates with consumers and establishes o’reilly as their source for the parts they need and excellent customer service 

  

marketing to the professional service provider customer 

we have over 470 fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our first call® program each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industryleading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below 

  























  

marketing to the independently owned parts store 

along with the daily operation and management of the dcs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our wholly owned subsidiary “ozark” also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores “jobber stores” throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an oreilly store ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores 

  

approximately 185 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from ozark and participate in our parts city auto parts program our proprietary jobber service program as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of the respective logo that is owned by ozark in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

  

  

 

pricing 

  

we believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area 

  

customer payments and returns policy 

  

our stores accept cash checks debit and credit cards we also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our preestablished credit requirements some of the factors considered in our preestablished credit requirements include customer creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms no customer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated net sales nor do we have any dependence on any single customer 

  

we accept product returns for new products core products and warrantydefective products 

  

industry environment 

  

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately  231 billion according to the automotive aftermarket industry association “aaia” this market is made up of four segments – labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately  131 billion which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and diy sales we do not sell tires or perform forfee automotive repairs or installations 

  

competition 

  

we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with the stores identified below 

  













  

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital expenditures to support such as the capital expenditures required for the distribution network store network and inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket 

  

inflation and seasonality 

  

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increases due to base commodity price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

  

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

  

  

 

regulations 

  

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

  

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates deposited into vendorsupplied containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty vendors in general our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the vendor 

  

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date we cannot give any assurance however that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unawa re or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission co uld have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forwardlooking statements 

  

 

deteriorating e conomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in recent years w orldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions including the united states and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future   although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending   many of these factors are outside of our control   our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions also  the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase   if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are l arger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competit ors are smaller than we are  but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales 

o ur business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our cu stomers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts in addition our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our a bility to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 201 3 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which cou ld cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

  

 

a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect ou r financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to les s competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

  

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

  













  

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers “dc”s or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business  

we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry we believe our continued success depends in part on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse affects on our business or team members 

  

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amende d subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perce ption that such sale s might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 

  

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fa il to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of acquired businesses will be successful or that they will successfull y meet the expectati ons of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our business would likely suffer 

 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our bus iness 

  

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have in place  a n   un secured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things  

  













  

in addition the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative and negative covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees  a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive vendor financing programs 

credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital the evaluations are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates  a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our vendor financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our vendor financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flow 

  

a breach of customer  team member or c ompany information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team member s we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing  and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs   there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches  and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition  

  

l itigation governmental proceedings  environmental legislation and regulations and employment laws and regulations may affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future may become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings  arising out of the ordinary course of our business the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material   and may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

  

environmental legislation and regulations like the i nitiativ es to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change  could a dversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law additional climate change 

 

related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters if enacted could adversely impact our costs including among other things increasing fuel prices 

  

our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage our success depends in part on our ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation a violation of or change in such laws andor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the enacted patient protection and affordable care act as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by congress and state legislators  could significantly impact our healthcare cost structure and increase our healthcare related expenses  we are currently evaluating the potential impact the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate the impacts  including potential modifications to our current benefit plans operational changes to minimize the impact of the legislation to our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcarerelated expenses i f we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation  our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted

 item 2   properties 

  

distribution centers stores and other properties 

we currently operate 24 regional distribution centers “dc”s as of december 31 2012 we leased nine dcs  29 million operating square footage and owned 15 dcs  57 million operating square footage for total dc square footage of 86 million the following table provides information regarding our dcs returns facilities and corporate offices as of december 31 2012 

  



  

 

of the 24 dcs that we operated at december 31 2012 15 were owned and nine were leased the leased facilities typically require a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expense and have an original term of at a minimum 20 years subject to one fiveyear renewal at our option one of our bulk facilities is leased from an entity owned by an affiliated director’s immediate family this lease requires payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of 15 years subject to three fiveyear renewals at our option we believe that this lease agreement with the affiliated entity is on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

  

of the 3976 stores that we operated at december 31 2012 1359 stores were owned 2540 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 77 stores were leased from entities in which certain of our affiliated directors members of our affiliated director’s immediate family or our executive officers are affiliated leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with two of the eight affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from march 31 2013 to september 30 2031 we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

  

we believe that our present facilities are in good condition are adequately insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations the store servicing capability of our 24 existing dcs is approximately 4425 stores providing a growth capacity of more than 400 st ores  which will increase by 300 stores with the completion of our lakeland florida dc which is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2014 and provide distribution system support for store growth into southern florida we believe the   growth capacity in our 24 existing dcs along with the additional capacity of our new lakeland florida  dc will provide us with the dc infrastructure needed for nearterm expansion  however as we expand our geographic footprint we will continue to evaluate our existing distribution system infrastructure and will adjust our distribution system capacity as needed to support our future growth 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

o’reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the company’s business the company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss the company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters although the company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters it does not currently believe that in the aggregate these matters taking into account applicable insurance and reserves will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period 

  

in addition o’reilly was   involved in resolving governmental investigations that were being conducted against csk and csk’s former officers and other litigation prior to its acquisition by o’reilly as described below 

  

as previously reported the governmental investigations of csk regarding its legacy preacquisition accounting practices have concluded all criminal charges against former employees of csk related to its legacy preacquisition accounting practices as well as the civil litigation filed against csk’s former chief executive officer by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” have concluded 

  

under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements csk may have certain indemnification obligations as a result of the csk acquisition o’reilly has incurred legal fees and costs related to these potential indemnification   obligations arising from the litigation commenced by the department of justice and sec against csk’s former employees whether those legal fees and costs are covered by csk’s insurance is subject to uncertainty and given its complexity and scope the final outcome cannot be predicted at this time o’reilly has a remaining reserve with respect to the indemnification obligations of  137 million at december 31 2012 which relates to the payment of those legal fees and costs already incurred it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the company’s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by resolution of such matter depending in part upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period however at this time management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter after consideration of applicable reserves should not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

overview 

  

we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states we are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers selling our products to both doityourself “diy” and professional service provider customer s our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects “good” “better” and “best” alternatives our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry as of december 31 201 2 we operated 3976 stores in 42 states 

  

operating within the retail industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer preferences and spending habits and competition the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact o’reilly and the retail sector in general we believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “tradedown” to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions we have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences however we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of “purchasing up” on the value spectrum 

  

we believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers’ willingness to return to “purchasing up” on the value spectrum in the future as the us economy recovers however we cannot predict whether when or the manner in which these economic conditions will change 

  

 

we believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles new light vehicle registrations average vehicle age and unemployment 

  







  

we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values of customer service and expense control 

  

key events and recent developments   

  

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below 

  





 



  

results of operations 

  

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

  



  

2012 compared to 2011 

  

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2012 increased  393 million to  618 billion from  579 billion for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 7  comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 38  and 46  for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 

  

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2012 in millions 



  

we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service superior inventory availability a broader selection of products offered in most stores a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store tea m member s that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 

  

 

our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31 2012 was driven by an increase in average ticket values partially offset by a decrease in diy customer transaction counts the improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly  hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales the growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in diy hard part sales as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles the strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts driven by our acquired markets have been offset by pressured diy transaction counts diy customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages both diy and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by betterengineered and more technically advanced vehicles which have been manufactured in recent years these vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time however when repairs are required the cost of the repair is typically greater 

  

we opened 180 net new stores and acquired 56 stores during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 170 net new stores for the year ended december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 we operated 3976 stores in 42 states compared to 3740 stores in 39 states at december 31 2011 we anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 190 net new stores in 201 3

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2012 increased to  310 billion or 501  of sales from  284 billion or 490  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 9  the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to distribution center “dc” efficiencies acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix dc efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced dc team members in our maturing dcs in addition during 2012 we increased our storelevel inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels the costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and as a result we realized a onetime benefit from capitalized distribution costs this capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points versus the prior year however we do not anticipate realizing this excess benefit in future periods acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs the improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than diy sales as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers therefore creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales

2011 compared to 2010 

  

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2011 increased  391 million to  579 billion from  540 billion for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 7  comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 46  and 88  for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 

  

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2011 in millions 



  

we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service superior inventory availability a broader selection of products offered in most stores a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period the growth in the hard part categories was   driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in diy sales to the hard part categories during the year diy customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts 

  

we opened 170 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 149 net new stores for the year ended december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 we operated 3740 stores in 39 states compared to 3570 stores in 38 states at december 31 2010 

  

gross profit

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to  197 billion or 341  of sales from  189 billion or 350  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 5  the increase in total sga dollars was primarily the result of additional employees facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business 

  

operating income 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to  867 million or 150  of sales from  713 million or 132  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 22  the increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above as well as  3 million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the securities and exchange commission “sec” and a forme r csk of ficer that resulted in the reimbursement to csk of incentivebased compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer discussed in detail below – see note 12 legal matters to the consolidated financial statements versus a 21 million charge to operating income in the prior year related to the previously announced legacy united states department of justice “ doj ” investigation of csk discussed in detail below – see note 12 legal matters to the consolidated financial statements the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed sga from strong comparable store sales 

  

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to  51 million or 09  of sales from  23 million or 04  of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 118  the increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to onetime charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in january of 2011 discussed in detail below offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period in addition during 2010 we recognized a nonrecurring nonoperating gain of  12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of csk discussed in detail below

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to  508 million or 88  of sales from  419 million or 78  of sales for the same period in the prior year  representing an increase of 21

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our revolving credit facility  decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our revolving credit facility  we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

 

  

liquidity and related ratios 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december 31 2012 and 2011 dollars in millions 



  

1 quick assets include cash cash equivalents and receivables 

2 working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities 

3 current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities 

4 quick ratio is calculated as current assets less inventories divided by current liabilities 

5 debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by shareholders’ equity 

  

current liabilities increased 44 t otal de bt increased 37 and total equity decreased 26 from 2011 to 2012 the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 847 as of december 31 2012 as compared to 644 one year prior the increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of our unsecured 300 million 3800 senior notes during 2012 the decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paidincapital and retained earnings partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paidincapital from the proceeds of stock option exercises and related tax benefits executed under our director and employee sharebased compensation plans 

  

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 30 2012 2011 and 2010 in thousands 



  

operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year adjusted for the effect of noncash depreciation and amortization charges and the onetime noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility in january of 2011 decreases in net inventory investment and other assets and increases in income taxes payable adjusted for the effect of noncash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised and other current liabilities net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 847 and 644 at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the company under various programs the increase in income taxes payable adjusted for the noncash impacts discussed above was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during 2011 the increase in other current   

 

liabilities was primarily the result of the payment during 2011 for the onetime monetary penalty to the doj for the legacy csk doj investigation 

  

th e increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 wa s primarily due to strong net income for the year adjusted for the effect of noncash depreciation and amortization charges the onetime noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility in january of 2011 and deferred income taxes and a significant decrease in net inventory investment partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities driven by the payment of the onetime penalty to the doj for the legacy csk doj investigation our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 644 and 443 at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of 37 million during the year despite the fact that we opened 170 new stores during the year 

  

investing activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2012 partially offset by small acquisitions during the year total c apital expenditures were  301 million  328 million and  365 million in 2012 2011 and 20 10 respectively  the decrease in capital expenditures during 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened we were able to find real estate with attractive lease factors during 2012 and as a result opened a larger number of leased locations during 2012 as compared to the year prior opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location 

  

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2010 we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the csk markets and the conversion of the csk stores to the o’reilly pos resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during 2011 

  

we opened 180  170  and 149 net new stores in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  and acquired 56 stores in 2012  we plan to open 190 net new stores in 2013 the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately  17 million to  19 million  however suc h costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site    

  

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2012 in accordance with our boardapproved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt during 2011 partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the company’s incentive programs and the related tax benefits during 2012 

  

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2011 in accordance with our boardapproved share repurchase program which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in 2011 as compared to net repayments under our facilities during 2010 the net borrowings in 2011 are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our 4875 senior notes due 2021 and our 4625 senior notes due 2021 in january and september of 2011 respectively partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous abl credit facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured revolving credit facility the net repayments under our facilities in 2010 were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured abl credit facility 

  

credit facilities 

on january 14 2011 we entered into a new credit agreement for a fiveyear  750 million unsecured revolving credit facility “revolving credit facility” arranged by ba and barclays capital which was scheduled to mature in january of 2016 during 2011 we amended the unsecured revolving credit facility which decreased the facility to  660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility the amendment also extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility to september of 2016 in conjunction with the amendment to the revolving credit facility we recognized a onetime charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of  03 million which is included in “other income expense” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011 the revolving credit facility includes a  200 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a  75 million sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility we may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to  200 million we had standby letters of credit primarily to satisfy workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amount of  57 million and  60 million as of december 13 2012 and 2011 respectively as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility

the table below outlines the calculations of the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio covenants as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 and 2011 dollars in thousands   

  



  

the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with us gaap we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

  

share repurchase program 

under our share repurchase program as approved by our board of directors we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices based on a variety of factors such as price corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions we may increase or otherwise modify renew suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice during 2012 our board of directors approved resolutions to increase the cumulative authorization amount to  30 billion the most recent  500 million authorization is effective for a threeyear period and expires november 12 2015 each prior 500 million authorization was effective for a threeyear period beginning on the date of the additional authorization 

  

the following table identifies shares of the company’s common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program in thousands except per share data 

  

  



  

 

subsequent to the end of the year and through the date of this filing we repurchased an add itional 21 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of  9009 for a total investment of  186 million we have repurchased a total of 341 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of 2011 through and including february 28 2013 at an average price of  7637 for a total aggregate investment of  26 billio n 

  

contractual obligations 

  

our contractual obligations as of december 31 201 2  included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 5 “leasing” and note 11 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments pri marily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility  

  

deferred income taxes  which is included in “other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory  are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 201 3  which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 

  



  







  

we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 14 “in come taxes” to the c onsolidated f inancial s tatements these estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 201 2  we recorded a liability of  59 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of “other liabilities” 

  

off  balance sheet arrangements 

  

off  balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the enti ty that is not recorded in our c onsolidated financial statements w e have historically utilized various off  balance sheet financial instruments  including saleleaseback and synthetic lease transactions but we have not entered into 

 

any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize offbalance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements operations or growth plans 

  

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a  200 million sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  th o s e letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling  57   million and  60 million were outstanding at december 31 201 2 and 20 11  respectively 

  

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources see “contractual obligations” and n ote 11 “c ommitments” to the consolidated financial statements for information on our operating leases 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

  



  

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories at our stores and dcs to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if unrecorded shrink changed 10  from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2012 the financial impact would have been approximately  1 million or 01  of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2012 

  



  



  

we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 201 2  nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of o’reilly stock which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10  from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 

  



  



  



  

 



  



  



  

inflation and seasonality 

  

for the last three fiscal years we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

  

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year

recent accounting pronouncements   

  

in february of 2013 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  “asu 201302” under asu 201302 an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts asu 201302 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements we plan to adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ended march 31 2013 the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility historically we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates however as of december 31 2012 we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

  

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 110 billion and 080 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at 120 billion and 085 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively which was determined by reference to quoted market prices 

  

we invest certain of our excess cash balances in shortterm highlyliquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal as of december 31  201 2  our cash and cash equivalents totaled  248 million

 item 1 business tableend general information 

o’reilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries collectively “we” “o’reilly” or the “company” is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself “diy” customers and professional service providers our “dual market strategy” o’reilly automotive inc incorporated in 1957 as a corporation was founded by charles f o’reilly and his son charles h “chub” o’reilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri our common stock has traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “orly” since april 22 1993 

on december 29 2010 we completed a corporate reorganization creating a holding company structure which was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger under section 351448 of the general corporation law of the state of missouri which did not require a vote of the shareholders as a result of this reorganization the previous parent company and registrant o’reilly automotive inc was renamed o’reilly automotive stores inc and is now a whollyowned subsidiary of the new parent company and registrant which was renamed o’reilly automotive inc 

on july 11 2008 we completed our most recent acquisition csk auto corporation “csk” which was one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest such retailers in the united states based on store count at the date of acquisition at the date of the acquisition csk had 1342 stores in 22 states operating under four brand names checker auto parts schuck’s auto supply kragen auto parts and murray’s discount auto parts the results of csk’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 

at december 31 2011 we operated 3740 stores in 39 states our stores carry an extensive product line including the products identified below 

 

  

  

 our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers such as those identified below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

see “risk factors” beginning on page 14 for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others deteriorating economic conditions the performance of the acquired csk stores increased debt levels our acquisition strategies competition in the automotive aftermarket business our dependence upon key and other personnel future growth assurance our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions the effect of sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock our relationships with key vendors and availability of key products a downgrade in our credit ratings complications in our distribution centers “dc”s and environmental legislation and regulations 

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o’reilly values of customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing superior customer service and significant value to both diy and professional service provider customers 

competitive advantages 

we believe our effective dual market strategy superior customer service strategic distribution systems and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages that cannot be easily duplicated 

proven ability to execute a dual market strategy 

over the past 30 years we have established a track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy customers and professional service providers we believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers 

in 2011 we derived approximately 59 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 41 of our sales from our professional service provider customers prior to the acquisition of csk we derived approximately 50 of our sales from both our diy and professional service provider customers as we continue to grow our commercial business in the acquired csk markets we expect that over time our diy and professional service provider sales mix to approximate historical averages as a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our over 460 fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service providers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who continue to derive a high concentration of their sales from the diy market 

superior customer service 

we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are identified below 

 

  

  

  

 technically proficient professional parts people 

our highlymotivated technicallyproficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service providers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic distribution systems 

we believe our commitment to a robust regional dc network provides for superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs which provides for efficient inventory control and management we currently operate 23 regional dcs which provide our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 123000 stock keeping units “sku”s many of which are hardtofind items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

  

experienced management team 

our company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the company we augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience we have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 148 professionals who average 17 years of service 266 corporate managers who average 13 years of service and 355 district managers who average 12 years of service our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating nineteen consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores 

we intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket we plan to open approximately 180 new stores in 2012 increasing our penetration in existing markets and expanding into new contiguous markets the sites for these new stores have been identified and to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores either by i constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store or iii purchasing multistore chains new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts number and type of existing automotive repair facilities competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued salesprofit growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket consequently we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

grow sales in existing stores 

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 

although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented we believe the ability of national retail chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation thus our intention is to continue to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard into new markets 

continually enhance store design and location 

our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

grow professional relationships with professional service providers in the western united states 

in order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the acquired csk store network and grow our share of the professional service provider market in those areas we have added four additional dcs to the western markets since the csk acquisition our strategically located dcs provide converted csk stores with sameday or overnight delivery access to an average of 123000 skus and give these stores an important tool to provide industryleading customer service to the professional service provider as well as the diy customer in addition our professional parts people receive ongoing training on our product lines customer service and o’reilly policies and procedures aimed at building and improving relationships with professional service providers 

  

the steps we have taken to implement our dual market strategy in the acquired csk stores have allowed us to begin to capture market share in the western united states however we continue to see significant opportunities to grow our share of the professional service provider business this growth will be driven by our ability to consistently provide superior customer service and parts availability proving o’reilly as a reliable partner and elevating our status as the preferred supplier on the call lists of professional service providers 

team members 

as of january 31 2012 we employed 49148 team members 32700 fulltime team members and 16448 parttime team members of whom 41693 were employed at our stores 5917 were employed at our dcs and 1538 were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 49 stores 459 team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years in addition approximately 75 team members who drive overtheroad trucks in two of our dcs are represented by a labor union except for these team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition of 55 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of each team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

  

store network 

store locations and size 

as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket our stores on average carry approximately 21000 skus and average approximately 7100 total square feet in size at december 31 2011 we had a total of approximately 27 million square feet in our 3740 stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 123000 skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 192 hub stores which on average carry approximately 39000 skus and average approximately 10000 square feet in size 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings and prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

the following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

   

store layout

to enhance storelevel operations customer service and reliability we use linux servers and ibm iseries computer systems in our stores these systems are linked with the iseries computers located in each of our dcs our pointofsale terminals provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to graphically display parts and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and use barcode scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

new store site selection 

in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are identified below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 355 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores which provides our stores with the appropriate amount of operational support 

district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a 40hour manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri district managers and store managers also receive continuous training through online assignments field workshops and regional meetings 

we provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon their individual andor store’s sales and profitability in addition each of our district and store managers participates in our stock option program we believe that our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our district and store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers because a significant portion of our business is from professional service providers our professional parts people are required to be technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical 

  

diy customer often seeks assistance from a professional parts person particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation about the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with their regional field sales manager afterward these team members spend one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each o’reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace we have no material backlog of orders for the products we sell 

our online ordering service provides enhanced customer service capabilities to our diy and professional service provider customers our program allows customers to view available parts and prices online purchase parts online andor either ship these purchases to their location or have these parts available for pick up in our local store 

distribution systems 

we believe that our tiered distribution model provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory moreover we believe that our ongoing significant capital investments made to expand the network of dcs allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each dc we currently have a total growth capacity of approximately 500 stores in our distribution network 

distribution centers 

we currently operate 23 dcs comprised of approximately 85 million operating square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of dc operating square footages our dcs utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores our dcs stock an average of 123000 skus and most dcs are linked to multiple other regional dcs’ inventory our dcs provide fivenightaweek delivery primarily via a companyowned fleet to all of our stores in the continental united states in addition stores within a dc metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from our dc “city counters” many of which receive this service seven days per week 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2012 we plan to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 master inventory “hub” stores 

we currently operate 192 strategically placed master inventory “hub” stores in addition to serving diy and professional service provider customers in their markets hub stores also provide our other stores within the surrounding area access to an expanded selection of skus on a sameday basis our hub stores average approximately 3000 square feet more than our typical stores and carry an average of 18000 skus more than our typical stores 

  

products and purchasing 

our stores offer diy and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco armor all bosch bwd cardone castrol gates rubber monroe moog pennzoil prestone quaker state stp turtle wax valvoline wagner and wix in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality private label products under our besttest ®  brakebest ®  master pro ®  microgard ®  murray ®  omnispark ®  o’reilly auto parts ®  power torque ®  super start ®  and ultima ® proprietary name brands our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value – a characteristic important to our diy customers we have added o’reilly branded chemicals and commodities as well as proprietary private label products to all acquired csk stores these stores have also undergone hardpart resets which significantly increased their hardpart sku offering giving our customers in all stores a good better and best product offering 

we have no longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors during 2011 we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors the five largest of which accounted for approximately 21 of our total purchases in 2011 our largest vendor in 2011 accounted for approximately 6 of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately 3 to 6 of such purchases 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer 

we use an integrated marketing program which includes television radio direct mail and newspaper distribution instore and online promotions and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the o’reilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand and productprice messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events we continued to cobrand all forms of advertising in the markets containing acquired csk stores during the first half of 2011 this manner of advertising and marketing was essential to not only build awareness of the o’reilly brand in those markets but to also allow for a smoother transition throughout the entire rebranding process store signage of all acquired csk stores was changed to the o’reilly brand during 2011 at which time cobranding ended and all forms of advertising promoted the o’reilly brand in all our markets 

to stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 1500 grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 38 states during 2011 we maintained our partnership with the national association for stock car racing “nascar” as the official auto parts store of nascar and were the title sponsor of five national hot rod association “nhra” races from pomona california to charlotte north carolina 

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” basketball and the national football league “nfl” our relationships with over 50 ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominentlydisplayed o’reilly logos on tvvisible scoring table signs throughout the season 

through an expanded use of spanish language radio print and outdoor as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events we demonstrated our commitment to increasing marketing efforts that are targeted toward the hispanic auto parts consumer 

in 2011 we continued our dedicated problemsolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the longterm this highly relevant message resonates with consumers and establishes o’reilly as their source for the parts they need and excellent customer service 

  

marketing to the professional service provider customer 

we have over 460 fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our first call ® program each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industryleading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 marketing to the independently owned parts store 

along with the daily operation and management of the dcs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our wholly owned subsidiary “ozark” also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores “jobber stores” throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an o’reilly store ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores 

approximately 190 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from ozark and participate in our parts city auto parts program our proprietary jobber service program as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of the respective logo that is owned by ozark in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

pricing 

we believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area 

we have repositioned the product offering and pricing in all acquired csk stores to an everyday low price strategy to ensure we are competitive in every market in which we operate we believe competitive pricing is needed to grow our market share and maintain a customer’s repeat business and we believe strongly that this strategy is more sustainable requires less promotional spending and will produce better results than csk’s historical promotionalbased highlow pricing strategy 

customer payments and returns policy 

our stores accept cash checks debit and credit cards we also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our preestablished credit requirements some of the factors considered in our preestablished credit requirements include customer creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms no customer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated net sales nor do we have any dependence on any single customer 

we accept product returns for new products core products and warrantydefective products 

industry environment 

the automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavyduty vehicles after the original sale the total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be 215 billion according to the automotive aftermarket industry association “aaia” this market is made up of four segments – labor share of professional service provider sales auto parts share of professional service provider sales diy sales and tire sales o’reilly’s addressable market within this industry includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and diy sales we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations 

  

competition 

we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market we compete primarily with the stores identified below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel price store layout and convenient and accessible store locations our dual market strategy requires significant capital expenditures to support such as the capital expenditures required for the distribution network store network and inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increases due to base commodity price increases industry wide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates deposited into vendorsupplied containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty vendors in general our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the vendor 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date we cannot give any assurance however that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations

 item 1a  risk factors tableend our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forwardlooking statements 

deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in recent years worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions including the united states and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future although demand for many of our products is primarily nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the us the total number of registered vehicles the us the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the us adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products which could negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions also the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we cannot assure that the recently integrated csk auto corporation “csk” stores will perform at the same desired level of profitability as historic o’reilly stores 

we expect acquired csk stores to approximate the profitability levels of our core o’reilly stores and believe this to be a significant factor in achieving our financial goals the failure of these stores to attain these profitability levels could seriously impact our forecasted results of operations our ability to operate these stores at our expected level will depend in part on the successful preservation of the existing diy customers already established in these markets growing the commercial customer base the adoption of the o’reilly culture along with maintaining employee morale and the retention of key personnel 

we may not be able to obtain these profitability levels in our acquired csk stores as soon as we expect or at all if we fail to address the challenges of our new markets effectively our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive vendor financing programs 

credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital the evaluations are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at a specific rate a downgrade in our current credit rating from both agencies would adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future in addition a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our vendor financing programs at attractive rates decreased participation in our vendor financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flow 

  

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have in place an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative and negative covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2012 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our costs and sales 

approximately 28 of our stores are located in texas and california therefore our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers in addition our stores located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amended subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 

risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of csk will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our business would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours operability of our computer systems andor availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers “dc”s or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and timely provide products to our customers our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or other catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

a breach of customer team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team members we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

environmental legislation and regulations could affect our operations such as by increasing fuel prices and therefore increase our operating costs 

initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change have been introduced in the us congress which could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these mandates if enacted could adversely impact our costs including among other things increasing fuel prices

 item 2 properties tableend distribution centers and other properties 

we currently operate 23 regional distribution centers “dc”s as of december 31 2011 we leased eight dcs 28 million operating square footage and owned 15 dcs 57 million operating square footage for total dc square footage of 85 million the following table provides information regarding our dcs returns facilities and corporate offices as of december 31 2011 

 

  

  of the 23 dcs that we operated at december 31 2011 15 were owned and 8 were leased the leased facilities typically require a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expense and have an original term of at a minimum 20 years subject to one fiveyear renewal at our option one of our bulk facilities is leased from an entity owned by an affiliated director’s immediate family this lease requires payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of 15 years subject to three fiveyear renewals at our option we believe that this lease agreement with the affiliated entity is on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

  

of the 3740 stores that we operated at december 31 2011 1286 stores were owned 2381 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 77 stores were leased from entities in which certain of our affiliated directors members of our affiliated director’s immediate family or our executive officers are affiliated leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with two of the six affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from march 31 2013 to september 30 2031 we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

we believe that our present facilities are in good condition are adequately insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations the store servicing capability of our 23 existing dcs is approximately 4340 stores providing a growth capacity of more than 500 stores we believe this growth capacity will provide us with the dc infrastructure needed for nearterm expansion without the need for additional dc facilities

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend o’reilly litigation 

o’reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the company’s business the company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss the company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters although the company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters it does not currently believe that in the aggregate these matters taking into account applicable insurance and reserves will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period 

in addition o’reilly is involved in resolving governmental investigations that were being conducted against csk and csk’s former officers and other litigation prior to its acquisition by o’reilly as described below 

csk preacquisition matters – governmental investigations and actions 

as previously reported the governmental investigations of csk regarding its legacy preacquisition accounting practices have concluded 

csk’s former controller and its former director of credit and receivables pled guilty to obstruction of justice on april 7 2009 and april 15 2009 respectively as previously reported they were sentenced on november 7 2011 csk’s former chief financial officer was sentenced as previously reported on september 19 2011 no appeal followed accordingly with the sentencing on november 7 2011 criminal proceedings against former csk employees have reached finality 

the action filed by the sec on july 22 2009 against maynard l jenkins the former chief executive officer of csk seeking reimbursement from mr jenkins of certain bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to section 304 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as previously reported has also reached finality on november 16 2011 the court entered a final judgment which required mr jenkins to reimburse 28 million to the company as successor sec issuer to csk auto corp since entry of the final judgment the payment obligation created thereunder has been satisfied and o’reilly has recorded the reimbursement as an adjustment to operating income in the fourth quarter of 2011 

the previously reported sec civil action for alleged misconduct related to csk’s historical accounting practices against the former chief financial officer controller and director of credit and receivables of csk remains ongoing however on january 20 2012 the parties filed a “joint report on settlement talks” wherein they report that offers of settlement had been made which would be presented to the commission for its consideration and approval the parties have requested a “complete litigation standstill” while the commission considers the settlement offers made under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements csk may have certain indemnification obligations in connection with the sec civil action and as a result o’reilly is currently incurring legal fees in relation to the ongoing sec litigation some of these indemnification obligations and other related costs may not be covered by csk’s insurance policies 

as a result of the csk acquisition o’reilly has incurred and expects to continue to incur additional legal fees and costs related to the indemnity obligations arising from the litigation commenced by the doj and sec against csk’s former employees until final resolution of the remaining matters o’reilly has a remaining reserve with respect to the indemnification obligations of 141 million at december 31 2011 which relates to both expected additional legal fees and costs and to the payment of those legal fees and costs already incurred 

  

the remaining litigation as described above is subject to uncertainty and given its complexity and scope the final outcome cannot be predicted at this time it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the company’s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate resolution of such matter depending in part upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period however at this time management believes that the ultimate outcome of the pending matters after consideration of applicable reserves should not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

overview 

we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states we are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers selling our products to both doityourself “diy” customers and professional service providers our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects “good” “better” and “best” alternatives our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry as of december 31 2011 we operated 3740 stores in 39 states 

operating within the retail industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer preferences and spending habits and competition the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact o’reilly and the retail sector in general we believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “tradedown” to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions we have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences however we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum 

we have ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the us economy recovers however we cannot predict whether when or the manner in which these economic conditions will change 

  

we believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles new light vehicle registrations average vehicle age and unemployment 

 

  

  

 key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below 

 

  

   

  

  

 results of operations 

the following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 2011 compared to 2010 

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 391 million to 579 billion from 540 billion for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 72 comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 46 and 88 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 

  

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2011 in millions 

 

 we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service superior inventory availability a broader selection of products offered in most stores a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period the growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in diy sales to the hard part categories during the year diy customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts 

we opened 170 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 149 net new stores for the year ended december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 we operated 3740 stores in 39 states compared to 3570 stores in 38 states at december 31 2010 we anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 180 net new stores in 2012 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to 284 billion or 490 of sales from 262 billion or 486 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 8 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix improved acquisition costs improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix the improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets the improved shrinkage is driven by our converted csk stores which are now managed using the o’reilly pointofsale system “pos” installed in all csk stores as they converted to the o’reilly distribution systems throughout 2009 and 2010 the o’reilly pos provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage distribution center efficiencies are the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center team members in our newer dcs professional service provider sales in the acquired csk markets are growing at a faster rate than total diy sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than diy sales as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to 197 billion or 341 of sales from 189 billion or 350 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 5 the increase in total sga dollars was primarily the result of additional employees facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business 

  

operating income 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to 867 million or 150 of sales from 713 million or 132 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 22 the increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above as well as 3 million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the securities and exchange commission “sec” and a former csk officer that resulted in the reimbursement to csk of incentivebased compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer discussed in detail below – see note 12 legal matters to the consolidated financial statements versus a 21 million charge to operating income in the prior year related to the previously announced legacy csk doj investigation discussed in detail below – see note 12 legal matters to the consolidated financial statements the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed sga from strong comparable store sales 

other income and expense 

total other expense for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to 51 million or 09 of sales from 23 million or 04 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 118 the increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to onetime charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in january of 2011 discussed in detail below offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period in addition during 2010 we recognized a nonrecurring nonoperating gain of 12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of csk discussed in detail below 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to 308 million 378 effective tax rate from 270 million 392 effective tax rate for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 14 the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income the decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the 21 million charge recorded in 2010 related to the legacy united states department of justice “doj” investigation of csk discussed in detail below which was not deductible for tax purposes 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to 508 million or 88 of sales from 419 million or 78 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 21 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 26 to 371 on 137 million shares from 295 on 142 million shares for the same period one year ago the impact of share repurchases during 2011 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately 019 

adjustments for nonrecurring and nonoperating events 

our results for the year ended december 31 2011 included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the sec and a former csk officer that resulted in the reimbursement to o’reilly as successor issuer to csk of 3 million 2 million net of tax of incentivebased compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer this “clawback” amount was included in “operating income” on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011 our results for the year ended december 31 2011 also included onetime charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on january 14 2011 the onetime charges included a noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous abl credit facility in the amount of 22 million 13 million net of tax and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of 4 3 million net of tax the charges related to our new financing transactions were included in “other income expense” on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011 our results for the year ended december 31 2010 included a nonrecurring nonoperating gain in “other income expense” of 12 million 7 million net of tax related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the csk acquisition as well as a charge related to the legacy doj investigation into csk’s preacquisition historical accounting practices we accrued 21 million during 2010 in anticipation of executing a nonprosecution agreement “npa” among the doj csk and o’reilly and paying a onetime monetary penalty of 21 million during the third quarter of 2011 the npa was executed and the previously recorded onetime 21 million penalty was paid to the doj on behalf of csk the charge related to the legacy csk doj investigation was included in “operating income” on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2010 the results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap measure in the subsequent table 

adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 18 to 864 million or 149 of sales from 734 million or 136 of sales for the same period one year ago adjusted net income for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 21 to 522 million or 90 of sales from 433 million or 80 of sales for the same period one year ago adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the years ended december 31 2011 increased 25 to 381 from 305 for the same period one year ago 

  

the table below outlines the impact of the charges related to the new financing transactions the former csk officer clawback the legacy csk doj investigation charge as well as the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 amounts in thousands except per share data 

 

 the financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts the former csk officer clawback the charges for the legacy csk doj investigation and the nonrecurring nonoperating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of csk provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors which is indicative of our core operations we exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

2010 compared to 2009 

sales 

sales for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 550 million to 54 billion from 485 billion for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 11 comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales during the one to twoweek period certain csk branded stores were closed for conversion comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 88 and 46 for the year ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2010 in millions 

 

 we believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of superior inventory availability a broader selection of products offered in most stores a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers the improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values we believe that the increase in transaction counts was a result of the customer’s focus on better maintaining their current vehicles the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired csk markets the improvement in average ticket value was primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories 

we opened 149 net new stores during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 142 net new stores for the year ended december 31 2009 at december 31 2010 we operated 3570 stores compared to 3421 stores at december 31 2009 

gross profit 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 increased to 262 billion or 486 of sales from 233 billion or 480 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 13 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted csk stores partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers the improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories increasing hard part sales were the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retained their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the csk stores supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network lower product acquisition costs were derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of csk the benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarters of 2010 as compared to the same periods in 2009 when we renegotiated these vendor contracts our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 reflected comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage the decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted csk stores was the result of the more robust o’reilly point of sale system “pos” which was installed in all csk stores when they converted to the o’reilly distribution systems the o’reilly pos provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than diy sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than diy sales as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales the reduced leverage on distribution center costs was the result of the additional distribution centers which were opened in conjunction with the csk integration plan new team members in these distribution centers were not yet fully proficient with distribution operations resulting in inefficiencies 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga for the year ended december 31 2010 increased to 189 billion or 350 of sales from 179 billion or 369 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 6 the increase in total sga dollars was primarily the result of additional employees facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired csk stores as well as increased incentive compensation for team members resulting from strong comparable store sales the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels 

operating income 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2010 increased to 713 million or 132 of sales from 538 million or 111 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 33 the increase in operating income was the result of increased sales and gross profit offset by the increased sga discussed above as well as a 21 million charge related to the legacy doj investigation of csk as discussed in item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 12 “legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed sga costs from strong comparable store sales 

other income and expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased to 39 million or 07 of sales from 45 million or 09 of sales for the same period one year ago representing a decrease of 13 the decrease in interest expense during 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our abl credit facility included as a component of “other income” for the year ended december 31 2010 was a nonrecurring nonoperating gain of 12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of csk 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2010 increased to 270 million 392 effective tax rate from 189 million 381 effective tax rate for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 43 the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income the increase in the effective rate was primarily the result of the charge related to the csk doj investigation of 21 million which was not deductible for tax purposes 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income for the year ended december 31 2010 increased to 419 million or 78 of sales from 307 million or 63 of sales for the same period one year ago representing an increase of 36 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 32 to 295 on 142 million shares from 223 on 138 million shares for the same period one year ago 

adjustments for nonrecurring and nonoperating events 

our results for the year ended december 31 2010 included charges related to the nonrecurring nonoperating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from csk discussed above as well as the charges related to the legacy csk doj investigation discussed above adjusted operating income increased 37 to 734 million 136 of sales for the year ended december 31 2010 from 538 million 111 of sales for the same period one year ago adjusted net income increased 41 to 433 million 80 of sales for the year ended december 31 2010 from 307 million 63 of sales for the same period one year ago adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 37 to 305 for the year ended december 31 2010 from 223 for the same period one year ago the table below outlines the impact of the charges related to the legacy csk doj investigation and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 amounts in thousands except per share data 

 

 the financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with gaap we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the charges for the legacy csk doj investigation and the nonrecurring nonoperating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the 

  

acquisition of csk provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors which is indicative of our core operations we exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores fund strategic acquisitions expand distribution infrastructure operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our boardapproved share repurchase program the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our revolving credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our revolving credit facility we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels

     total debt increased 122 and total equity decreased 11 from 2010 to 2011 the increase in total debt was attributable the issuance of our senior notes during 2011 partially offset by the repayment of our abl credit facility in january of 2011 the decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paidin capital and retained earnings offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paidincapital from the proceeds of stock option exercises and related excess tax benefits executed under our director and employee sharebased compensation plans 

the following table identifies cash provided byused in our operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 30 2011 2010 and 2009 in thousands 

 

 operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to strong net income for the year adjusted for the effect of noncash depreciation and amortization charges the onetime noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility in january of 2011 and deferred income taxes and a significant decrease in net inventory investment partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities driven by the payment of the onetime penalty to the doj for the legacy csk doj investigation net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory 

  

net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 644 and 443 at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of 37 million during the year despite the fact that we opened 170 new stores during the year the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for the effect of noncash depreciation and amortization charges and deferred income taxes a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in 2009 the decrease in net inventory investment in 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of the significant investments in 2009 to improve the inventory availability in the acquired csk stores the increase in other liabilities was principally due to the accrual of the csk doj investigation charge during 2010 which was paid in 2011 

investing activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures total capital expenditures were 328 million in 2011 365 million in 2010 and 415 million in 2009 during 2010 we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the csk markets and the conversion of the csk stores to the o’reilly pos resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during 2011 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of csk and an increase in payments received on notes receivable capital expenditures related to the acquisition of csk included the purchase of properties for distribution centers “dc”s and costs associated with the conversion of csk stores to the o’reilly brand although we opened four new dcs in 2010 a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these dcs occurred in 2009 as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities the increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the onetime nonrecurring payment received to settle a note receivable acquired in the csk acquisition 

we opened 170 net new stores in 2011 149 net new stores in 2010 and 150 net new stores in 2009 we plan to open 180 net new stores in 2012 the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition improvements fixtures vehicles net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 13 million to 15 million however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2011 in accordance with our boardapproved share repurchase program which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in 2011 as compared to net repayments under our facilities during 2010 the net borrowings in 2011 are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our 4875 senior notes due 2021 and our 4625 senior notes due 2021 in january and september of 2011 respectively partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous abl credit facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured revolving credit facility the net repayments under our facilities in 2010 were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured abl credit facility net cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our longterm debt 

credit facilities 

on july 11 2008 we entered into a credit agreement for a fiveyear assetbased revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in july of 2013 at december 31 2010 we had outstanding borrowings of 356 million under the abl credit facility of which 106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract all outstanding borrowings under the abl credit facility were repaid and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on january 14 2011 and the abl credit facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4875 senior notes due 2021 as further described below in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility we recognized a onetime noncash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the abl credit facility in the amount of 22 million and a onetime charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of 4 million which are included in “other income expense” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011 

on january 14 2011 we entered into a new credit agreement for a fiveyear 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility arranged by ba and barclays capital which was scheduled to mature in january of 2016 during 2011 we amended the unsecured revolving credit facility which decreased the facility to 660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility the amendment also extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility to september of 2016 in conjunction with the amendment to the revolving credit facility we recognized a onetime charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of 03 million which is included in “other income expense” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2011 the revolving credit facility includes a 200 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 75 million sublimit for swing line borrowings as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility we may from time to time subject to certain conditions increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 200 million as of december 31 2011 we had standby letters of credit primarily to satisfy workers’ compensation general liability and other insurance policies in the amount of 60 million as of december 31 2011 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

  

senior notes 

4875 senior notes due 2021 

on january 14 2011 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4875 senior notes due 2021 “4875 senior notes due 2021” at a price to the public of 99297 of their face value with united missouri bank na “umb” as trustee interest on the 4875 senior notes due 2021 is payable on january 14 and july 14 of each year which began on july 14 2011 and is computed on the basis of a 360day year the net proceeds from the issuance of the 4875 senior notes due 2021 were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our abl credit facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and costs associated with terminating our existing interest rate swap contracts with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 

4625 senior notes due 2021 

on september 19 2011 we issued 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4625 senior notes due 2021 “4625 senior notes due 2021” at a price to the public of 99826 of their face value with umb as trustee interest on the 4625 senior notes due 2021 is payable on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning on march 15 2012 and is computed on the basis of a 360day year the net proceeds from the issuance of the 4625 senior notes due 2021 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes including share repurchases 

the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries “subsidiary guarantors” that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our revolving credit facility or certain of our other debt or any of our subsidiary guarantors the guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several each of the subsidiary guarantors is whollyowned directly or indirectly by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be subsidiary guarantors would be minor subsidiaries no minor subsidiaries exist today neither we nor any of our subsidiary guarantors are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries except as provided by applicable law each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants with which we complied as of december 31 2011 

debt covenants 

the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property in each case as set forth in the indentures these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions 

the credit agreement contains covenants including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 times through december 31 2012 225 times through december 31 2014 25 times through maturity and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 30 times through maturity the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and stock option compensation expense “ebitdar” to adjusted debt adjusted debt includes outstanding debt outstanding standby letters of credit sixtimes rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of longterm debt in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement certain actions may be taken against us including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders we had a fixed charge coverage ratio of 486 times and 421 times as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and an adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio of 175 times and 157 times as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements under our current financing policy we have targeted an adjusted consolidated leverage ratio range of 20 times to 225 times 

  

the table below outlines the calculations of the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio covenants as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 dollars in thousands 

 

 the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with us gaap we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement we include these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of these nongaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a costeffective alternative to our existing sources of cash we do not believe however that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans 

on december 29 2000 we entered into a saleleaseback transaction with an unrelated party under the terms of the transaction we sold 90 properties including land buildings and improvements which generated 52 million of cash the lease which is being accounted for as an operating lease provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial tenyear period and two additional successive periods of five years each the resulting gain of 5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term net rent expense during the initial term is approximately 5 million annually 

in august 2001 we entered into a saleleaseback with o’reillywooten 2001 llp an entity owned by certain of our affiliates the transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine o’reilly auto parts stores and generated approximately 6 million of cash the transaction did not result in a material gain or loss the lease which has been accounted for as an operating lease calls for an initial term of 15 years with three fiveyear renewal options 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 60 million and 71 million were outstanding at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 included commitments for short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements selfinsurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 5 “longterm debt” and note 11 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in “other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2012 which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

  

   we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties which are fully disclosed in note 14 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements these estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2011 we recorded a liability of 53 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of “other liabilities” 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

  

 we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories at our stores and dcs to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if unrecorded shrink changed 10 from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2011 the financial impact would have been approximately 1 million or 01 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2011 

 

  

 we review goodwill for impairment annually on november 30 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december 31 2011 nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of o’reilly stock which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10 from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 

 

   

  

  

  

  

   

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

quarterly results 

the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2011 and 2010 the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown the unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report and the other financial information included therein 

 

 recent accounting pronouncements

in may of 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards “201104” asu 201104 was issued to bring the definition of fair value the guidance for fair value measurement and the disclosure requirements under us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” in line with one another asu 201104 also enhanced the disclosure requirements for changes and transfers within the valuation hierarchy levels particularly valuations in level 3 fair value measurements and was effective for periods beginning after december 15 2011 the application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore should not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

in june of 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income “201105” asu 201105 was issued to improve the comparability of financial reporting between us gaap and ifrs and eliminates previous us gaap guidance that allowed an entity to present components of other comprehensive income “oci” as part of its statement of changes in shareholders’ equity with the issuance of asu 201105 companies are now required to report all components of oci either in a single continuous statement of total comprehensive income which includes components of both oci and net income or in a separate statement appearing consecutively with the statement of income asu 201105 does not affect current guidance for the accounting of the components of oci or which items are included within total comprehensive income in december of 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201112 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105 “201112” asu 201112 defers changes in asu 201105 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments shown on the face of the financial statements no other requirements of asu 201105 were affected by the issuance of asu 201112 including the requirement to report income either in a single continuous financial statement or in a separate statement of total comprehensive income which is effective for periods beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we adopted this guidance with our 2011 financial statements the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in september of 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 testing goodwill for impairment “201108” asu 201108 was issued to simplify the impairment test of goodwill by allowing entities to use a qualitative approach to determine whether goodwill impairment might exist before completing the entire impairment test under asu 201108 an entity has the option to first assess any qualitative factors that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the changes under asu 201108 are effective for public companies for annual and interim testing performed for periods beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted the application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility historically we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates however as of december 31 2011 we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and core o’reilly values of customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing superior customer service and significant value to both professional service providers and diy customers 

competitive advantages 

proven ability to execute a dual market strategy  we have an established track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy customers and professional service providers we believe our ability to execute a dual market strategy is a competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts by capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure by operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors as well as by enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers 

we have been committed to our dual market strategy for over 30 years in 2010 we derived approximately 62 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 38 of our sales from our professional service provider customers we have historically derived approximately 50 of our sales from both our diy and professional service provider customers and as we continue to grow our commercial business in the acquired csk stores we would expect our diy and professional service provider sales mix to approximate historical averages as a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our over 450 fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service providers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who derive a high concentration of their sales from the diy market we have a tremendous opportunity to build on the strong retail base at the acquired csk stores by growing the commercial business through the implementation of our dual market strategy and capitalizing on our other competitive advantages 

  

superior customer service  we seek to attract new diy and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

 technically proficient professional parts people  our highly proficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technicallyoriented professional service providers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic distribution systems  we believe our commitment to a robust regional dc network provides for superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more dcs providing for efficient inventory control and management our distribution system provides each of our stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 118000 stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hard to find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

we currently operate 23 dcs four of which opened in 2010 as these dcs opened the surrounding csk stores were converted to the o’reilly systems and began receiving sameday or overnight access to o’reilly’s broad range of hard part product offerings 

experienced management team  our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan including the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions we have experienced eighteen consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 we have a strong senior management team comprised of 146 professionals who average 18 years of service in addition our 260 corporate managers average 15 years of service and our 349 district managers average 13 years of service 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores  we intend to continue to open new stores to achieve greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 170 net new stores in 2011 and the sites for these new stores have been identified to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores either by i constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store or iii purchasing multistore chains new store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns demographic lifestyle segmentation age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts number and type of existing automotive repair facilities competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe we have competed effectively and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and achieve our goal of continued salesprofit growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket consequently we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy 

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional service provider resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

  

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions  although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented we believe the ability of national retail chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation thus our intention is to continue to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier 

continually enhance store design and location  our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

grow professional relationships with professional service providers in the western united states  in order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the acquired csk store network and grow our share of the professional service provider market in those areas we have added four additional dcs to the western markets since the csk acquisition our strategically located dcs provide converted csk stores with sameday or overnight delivery access to an average of 118000 skus and will give these stores an important tool to provide industryleading customer service to the professional service provider as well as the diy customer in addition our professional parts people receive ongoing training on our product lines customer service and o’reilly policies and procedures aimed at building and improving relationships with professional service providers 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 349 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores which provides our stores with the appropriate amount of operational support 

district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service leadership inventory management and store profitability as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model store managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position including attending a 40hour manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri district managers and store managers also receive continuous training through online assignments field workshops and regional meetings 

we provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon their individual andor store’s sales and profitability in addition each of our district and store managers participates in the company’s stock option program we believe that our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our district and store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

most of our current senior management district managers and store managers were promoted to their positions from within the company our senior management team averages 18 years of service corporate management team averages 15 years of service and our district management team has an average length of service of 13 years 

team members 

as of january 31 2011 we employed 47142 total team members 31070 fulltime team members and 16072 parttime team members of whom 39556 were employed at our stores 6053 were employed at our dcs and 1533 were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 51 stores 435 team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years in addition approximately 66 team members who drive overtheroad trucks in two of our dcs have voted in favor of becoming represented by labor unions however no collective bargaining agreements have been negotiated except for these team members our team members are not represented by labor unions our tradition of 54 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of every team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increases due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

  

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores of ours as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates deposited into vendorsupplied containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty vendors in general our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the vendor 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date we cannot give any assurance however that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation

store operations 

store network 

store locations  as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket the following table sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores 

 

   

our stores on average carry approximately 22000 skus and average approximately 7100 total square feet in size at december 31 2010 we had a total of approximately 253 million square feet in our 3570 stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest dc which averages 118000 skus but also have sameday access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 184 master inventory stores which on average carry approximately 39000 skus and average approximately 10000 square feet in size in addition to serving diy and professional service provider customers in their markets master inventory stores also provide our other stores within the surrounding area access to a greater selection of skus on a sameday basis 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings and prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers 

store layout  we utilize a computerassisted “planogrammed” store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent merchandise presentation however each store’s hardparts inventory assortment is customized to meet the specific needs of a particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand or seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation  to enhance storelevel operations customer service and reliability we use linux servers and ibm iseries computer systems in our stores these systems are linked with the iseries computers located in each of our dcs our pointofsale terminals provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to graphically display parts and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and use bar code scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

new store site selection  in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

products and purchasing 

our stores offer diy and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco armor all bosch bwd cardone castrol gates rubber monroe moog pennzoil prestone quaker state stp turtle wax valvoline wagner and wix in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality private label products under our besttest® brakebest® master pro® microgard® murray and omnispark® o’reilly auto parts® power torque® super start® and ultima® proprietary name brands our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value – a characteristic important to our diy customers we have added o’reilly branded chemicals and commodities as well as proprietary private label products to all acquired csk stores these stores have also undergone hardpart resets which significantly increased their hardpart sku offering giving our customers in all stores a good better and best product offering 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors the five largest of which accounted for approximately 22 of our total purchases in 2010 our largest vendor in 2010 accounted for approximately seven percent of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately three to five percent of such purchases we have no 

  

longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors during 2010 we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good 

pricing 

we believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area 

we have repositioned the product offering and pricing in all csk stores to an everyday low price strategy to ensure we are competitive in every market we believe competitive pricing is needed to grow our market share and maintain a customer’s repeat business and we believe strongly that this strategy is more sustainable requires less promotional spending and will produce better results than csk’s historical promotionalbased highlow pricing strategy 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional service provider customers because a significant portion of our business is from professional service providers our professional parts people are required to be technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from a professional parts person particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation about the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers once all of the required training has been satisfied our parts specialists become eligible to take the o’reilly certified parts professional test passing the o’reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with their regional field sales manager afterward these team members spend one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each o’reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer  we use an integrated marketing program which includes television radio direct mail and newspaper distribution instore and online promotions and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract diy customers the marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to an increase in awareness of the o’reilly brand across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand and productprice messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events during 2010 we continued to cobrand all forms of advertising in the markets containing acquired csk stores this manner of advertising and marketing is essential to not only build awareness of the o’reilly brand in those markets 

  

but to also allow for a smoother transition throughout the rebranding process store signage in substantially all acquired csk stores is expected to be changed to the o’reilly brand by the end of the first quarter of 2011 and we expect to end the cobranding of all forms of advertising during 2011 

to stimulate sales among race enthusiasts who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public during 2010 we sponsored multiple nationallytelevised races and over 1500 grassroots local and regional motorsports events throughout 38 states we maintained our partnership with the national association for stock car racing “nascar” as the official auto parts store of nascar and were the title sponsor of five national hot rod association “nhra” races from pomona california to charlotte north carolina 

during the fall and winter months we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” football and basketball and the national football league “nfl” our relationships with over 70 ncaa teams and tournaments have resulted in prominentlydisplayed o’reilly logos on tvvisible scoring table signs throughout the season in addition o’reilly auto parts radio advertising can be heard during more than 350 nfl games due to our sponsorship of nearly 20 teams 

through an expanded use of spanish language radio print and outdoor as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events we demonstrated our commitment to increasing marketing efforts that are targeted toward the hispanic auto parts consumer 

in 2010 we continued our dedicated problemsolution communication strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the long term this highly relevant message resonates with consumers and establishes o’reilly as their source for the parts they need and excellent customer service 

marketing to the professional service provider  we have over 450 fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industry leading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 marketing to the independently owned parts store  along with the daily operation and management of the dcs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our wholly owned subsidiary “ozark” also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores “jobber stores” throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an o’reilly store ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores 

approximately 185 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from ozark and participate in our parts city auto parts program our proprietary jobber service program as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of the respective logo that is owned by ozark in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we provide computer software for business management competitive pricing advertising marketing and sales assistance to parts city auto parts affiliate stores 

competition 

we compete in both the diy and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket we compete primarily with the stores bulleted below 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability price helpfulness of store personnel store layout and convenient and accessible store locations 

distribution system support 

we currently operate 23 dcs comprised of approximately 85 million operating square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of dc operating square footages our dcs are equipped with highly automated material handling equipment which efficiently expedite the movement of our products from the shelves to the loading areas for shipment to each of our stores on a nightly basis the dcs utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores in addition to the bar code system employed in our stores each of our stores is connected through secured data transmission technology to our dcs and corporate headquarters 

we believe that our distribution system provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory moreover we believe that our ongoing significant capital investments made to expand the network of dcs allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our dc expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each dc we currently have a total growth capacity of approximately 650 stores in our distribution network

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions also the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on whom we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we cannot assure that the recently integrated csk stores will perform at the same desired level of profitability as historic o’reilly stores 

we expect acquired csk stores to approximate the profitability levels of our core o’reilly stores and believe this to be a significant factor in achieving our financial goals the failure of these stores to attain these profitability levels could seriously impact our forecasted results of operations our ability to operate these stores at our expected level will depend in part on the successful preservation of the existing diy customers already established in these markets growing the commercial customer base the adoption of the o’reilly culture along with maintaining employee morale and the retention of key personnel 

we may not be able to obtain these profitability levels in our acquired csk stores as soon as we expect or at all if we fail to address the challenges of our new markets effectively our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger 

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have in place an unsecured credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative and negative covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing 

  

obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes 

credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital we currently have a bbb credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and a baa3 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service the evaluations are based upon among other factors our financial strength our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at a specific rate a downgrade in our current credit rating from both agencies would adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than us but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and as a result may adversely impact our sales and profitability for a discussion of our management see the “business” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2011 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our costs and sales 

approximately 29 of our stores are located in texas and california therefore our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding 

  

seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers in addition our stores located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

legal proceedings and related matters arising from csk could adversely affect us 

as discussed in item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 14 “legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements several of csk’s former officers and employees were charged by the department of justice “doj” and named in civil actions by the securities and exchange commission “sec” o’reilly and the doj have agreed in principle subject to final documentation to resolve csk’s preacquisition issues with the doj the preacquisition sec investigation of csk which commenced in 2006 was settled in may of 2009 by administrative order without fines disgorgement or other financial remedies under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements csk has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and as a result o’reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the behalf of these persons in relation to certain matters there can be no assurance that the expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of these matters will be covered by csk’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies if we incur significant uninsured expenses in connection with the resolution of the matters described above this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amended subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 

risks related to the company and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect the company’s stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future operating results of the company and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of csk will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our business would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

  

complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect our business 

we operate 23 distribution centers “dc” nationwide to support our business if complications arise with any facility or if any facility is severely damaged or destroyed our other dcs may not be able to fully support the resulting additional distribution demands this may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a nightly basis and therefore affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

environmental legislation and regulations could affect our operations such as by increasing fuel prices and therefore increase our operating costs 

initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change have been introduced in the us congress which could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these mandates if enacted could adversely impact our costs including among other things increasing fuel prices

 item 2 properties tableend the following table provides certain information regarding our administrative offices and distribution centers “dc” as of december 31 2010 

 

  

        

          of the 3570 stores that we operated at december 31 2010 1172 stores were owned 2328 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 70 stores were leased from one of four entities owned by o’reilly family members leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with two of the three o’reilly family entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from march 31 2011 to december 31 2029 we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

we believe that our present facilities are in good condition are adequately insured and adequate for the conduct of our current operations the store servicing capability of our 23 existing dcs is approximately 4250 stores providing a growth capacity for over 680 stores we believe this growth capacity will provide us with the dc infrastructure needed for near term expansion without the need for additional dc facilities

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend o’reilly litigation 

o’reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the company’s business although the company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters it does not currently believe that in the aggregate these matters taking into account applicable insurance and reserves will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period in addition o’reilly is involved in resolving the governmental investigations that were being conducted against csk and csk’s former officers prior to its acquisition by o’reilly automotive inc as described below 

csk preacquisition matters – governmental investigations and actions 

as previously reported the preacquisition securities and exchange commission “sec” investigation of csk which commenced in 2006 was settled in may of 2009 by administrative order without fines disgorgement or other financial remedies the department of justice “doj”’s criminal investigation into these same matters as previously disclosed is near a conclusion and is described more fully below in addition the previously reported sec complaint against three 3 former employees of csk for alleged conduct related to csk’s historical accounting practices remains ongoing the action filed by the sec on july 22 2009 against maynard l jenkins the former chief executive officer of csk seeking reimbursement from mr jenkins of certain bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to section 304 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as previously reported also continues the previously reported doj criminal prosecution of don watson the former chief financial officer of csk remains ongoing with trial set to commence on or about june 7 2011 

with respect to the ongoing doj investigation into csk’s preacquisition accounting practices as referenced above as previously disclosed o’reilly and the doj agreed in principle subject to final documentation to resolve the doj investigation of csk’s legacy preacquisition accounting practices the company and the doj continue work to complete the final documentation necessary for the execution of the nonprosecution agreement previously referenced and payment of the onetime monetary penalty of 209 million also previously reported the company’s total reserve related to the doj investigation of csk was 214 million as of december 31 2010 which relates to the amount of the monetary penalty and associated legal costs 

  

notwithstanding the agreement in principle with the doj several of csk’s former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed or deposed as part of criminal administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits as described above certain former employees of csk are the subject of civil and criminal litigation commenced by the government under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements csk has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and as a result o’reilly is currently incurring legal fees on behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters some of these indemnification obligations and other related costs may not be covered by csk’s insurance policies 

as a result of the csk acquisition o’reilly expects to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to the indemnity obligations related to the litigation that has commenced by the doj and sec of csk’s former employees o’reilly has a remaining reserve with respect to such indemnification obligations of 188 million as of december 31 2010 which was primarily recorded as an assumed liability in the company’s allocation of the purchase price of csk 

the foregoing governmental investigations and indemnification matters are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the company’s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of such matters depending in part upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period however at this time management believes that the ultimate outcome of all of such regulatory proceedings and other matters that are pending after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits not contemplated in recorded reserves should not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows

overview 

we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states we are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers selling our products to both doityourself diy customers and professional service providers our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment as of december 31 2010 we operated 3570 stores in 38 states 

operating within the retail industry we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer preferences and spending habits and competition the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our company and the retail sector in general we cannot predict whether when or the manner in which these economic conditions will change 

we believe that the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles average vehicle age new light vehicle sales unperformed maintenance unemployment and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket 

number of miles driven 

total miles driven in the us along with changes in the average age of vehicles on the road heavily influence the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell historically the longterm trend in the total miles driven in the us has steadily increased according to the department of transportation between 1999 and 2007 the total number of miles driven in the us increased at an average annual rate of approximately 16 in 2008 however difficult macroeconomic conditions and record high gas prices during the first half of the year led to a decrease in the number of miles driven and in 2009 miles driven remained relatively flat through november of 2010 miles driven in the us increased by 07 with miles driven increasing each month since march as the us economy recovers we believe that annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to increase the demand for our products 

  

number of us registered vehicles and new light vehicle sales 

as reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association “aaia” the total number of vehicles on the road in the us has exhibited steady growth over the past decade with the total number of registered vehicles increasing 18 from 205 million light vehicles in 2000 to 242 million in 2009 new light vehicle sales however have declined over the past decade between 2000 and 2007 new car sales in the us decreased by 7 from 174 million in 2000 to 162 million vehicles in 2007 due to the recent difficult macroeconomic environment in the us new light vehicles sales declined by 18 in 2008 to 132 million and declined by 21 in 2009 to 104 million vehicles which is the lowest level in the past decade based on the current economic environment we believe new light vehicle sales will remain below historic levels and consumers will continue to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher miles continuing the trend of an aging vehicle population 

average vehicle age of registered vehicles 

as reported by the aaia the average age of the us vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 91 years for passenger cars and 85 years for light trucks in 1999 to 106 and 96 years in 2009 respectively we believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and built vehicles which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors the decrease in new car sales over the past two years and the consumers’ willingness to invest in maintaining their highermileage better built vehicles as the average age of the vehicle on the road increases a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of manufacturer warranty these outofwarranty older vehicles generate strong demand for our products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles have more frequent mechanical failures which require replacement parts and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles would require 

unperformed maintenance 

according to estimates compiled by the automotive aftermarket suppliers association the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the us totaled 54 billion for 2009 versus 50 billion for 2008 this metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand we believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions beginning in 2008 contributed to the increased amount of unperformed maintenance in 2009 however with the reduced number of new car sales and consumers’ increased focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance decreased in 2010 resulting in a strong year in the automotive aftermarket 

unemployment 

challenging macroeconomic conditions have lead to high levels of unemployment monthly us unemployment rates for 2010 ranged from 94 to 99 we believe that these unemployment rates and continued uncertainty in the overall economic health have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending we also believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money and can be an important factor in the consumer’s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle while the deferral of vehicle purchases has lead to an increase in vehicle maintenance long term trends of high unemployment levels could reduce the number of total annual miles driven as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending habits both of which could negatively impact our business 

product quality differentiation 

we provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects “good” “better” and “best” alternatives our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry we believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “tradedown” to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions we have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the us economy recovers 

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

   

2010 compared to 2009 

sales 

sales increased 550 million or 11 from 485 billion in 2009 to 54 billion in 2010 the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2010 in millions 

 

 comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales during the one to twoweek period certain csk branded stores were closed for conversion comparable store sales increased 88 for the year ended december 31 2010 versus 46 for the year ended december 31 2009 

we believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability a broader selection of products offered in most stores a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers the improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values we believe that the increase in transaction counts is a result of the customer’s focus on better maintaining their current vehicles the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired csk markets the improvement in average ticket value is primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories 

store growth 

at december 31 2010 we operated 3570 stores compared to 3421 stores at december 31 2009 we anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 170 net new stores in 2011 versus 149 net new stores in 2010 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 294 million or 13 from 233 billion 480 of sales in 2009 to 262 billion 486 of sales in 2010 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted csk stores partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers the improvement in product mix is primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories increasing hard part sales are the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retain their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the csk stores supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network lower product acquisition costs are derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of csk the benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same periods in 2009 when we renegotiated these vendor contracts our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 reflect comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage the decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted csk stores is the result of the more robust o’reilly point of sale system “pos” which was installed in all csk stores when they converted to the o’reilly distribution systems the o’reilly pos provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than diy sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than diy sales as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales the reduced leverage on distribution center costs is the result of the additional distribution centers which have been opened in conjunction with the csk integration plan new team members in these distribution centers are not yet fully proficient with distribution operations resulting in inefficiencies we believe that the long term impact of the improved 

  

negotiating leverage with our vendors will allow us to generate gross margins at levels comparable to our 2010 full year results going forward however continued growth in our commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix will continue to pressure our gross margin results in the future 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased approximately 100 million or 6 from 179 billion 369 of sales in 2009 to 189 billion 350 of sales in 2010 the increase in total sga dollars is primarily the result of additional employees facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired csk stores as well as increased incentive compensation for team members resulting from strong comparable store sales the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels 

operating income 

operating income increased 175 million or 33 from 538 million 111 of sales in 2009 to 713 million 132 of sales in 2010 the increase in operating income is the result of increased sales and gross profit offset by the increased sga discussed above as well as a 21 million charge related to the legacy doj investigation of csk as discussed in item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 14 “legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed sga costs from strong comparable store sales this fullyear operating income as a percentage of sales represents a record high for the company and we would anticipate these operating levels to be sustainable 

other income and expense 

interest expense decreased 6 million from 45 million or 09 of sales in 2009 to 39 million or 07 of sales in 2010 the decrease in interest expense during 2010 as compared to 2009 is the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our secured assetbacked credit facility “credit facility” included as a component of “other income” for the year ended december 31 2010 is a nonrecurring nonoperating gain of 12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of csk 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes increased 81 million from 189 million 381 effective tax rate in 2009 to 270 million 392 effective tax rate in 2010 the increase in our provision for income taxes is due to the increase in our taxable income the increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of the charge related to the csk doj investigation of 21 million which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income increased 112 million or 36 from 307 million 63 of sales in 2009 to 419 million 78 of sales in 2010 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 32 to 295 on 142 million shares compared to 223 for the year ended december 31 2009 on 138 million shares 

adjustments for nonrecurring and nonoperating events 

our yeartodate results include a nonrecurring charge related to the ongoing legacy doj investigation of csk as well as a nonrecurring nonoperating gain in other income related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from csk adjusted operating income excluding the impact of the charge related to the doj investigation of csk increased 37 to 734 million 136 of sales for the year ended december 31 2010 from 538 million 111 of sales for the same period in 2009 adjusted net income excluding the impact of the charge related to the doj investigation of csk and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable increased 41 to 433 million 80 of sales for the year ended december 31 2010 from 307 million 63 of sales for the same period in 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per common share excluding the impact of the charge related to the doj investigation of csk and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable increased 37 to 305 for the year ended december 31 2010 from 223 for the same period in 2009 

  

the table below outlines the impact of the charge and the gain for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 amounts in thousands except per share data 

 

 the financial information presented in the table above is not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these items include adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the csk doj investigation charge and the gain on the settlement of the csk note receivable provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations we exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well the material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures are not reflective of actual gaap amounts we compensate for this limitation by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

2009 compared to 2008 

sales 

sales increased 127 billion or 36 from 358 billion in 2008 to 485 billion in 2009 the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2009 in millions 

 

 comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales during the onetotwo week period certain csk branded stores were closed for conversion comparable store sales for stores operating on the o’reilly systems increased 54 for the year ended december 31 2009 the o’reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a 66 increase for the core o’reilly and post conversion schuck’s stores a 21 increase from the 123 converted checker stores and a 119 decrease in comparable 

  

stores sales from the 141 converted murray’s stores comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy csk system increased 30 for the year ended december 31 2009 consolidated comparable store sales increased 46 for the year ended december 31 2009 versus 15 for the year ended december 31 2008 

we believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability a broader selection of products offered in most stores a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers the improvement in comparable store sales was primarily driven by an increase in transaction counts while average ticket remained flat with the prior year the flat average ticket value was attributable to more complex and costly repair parts consistent with ongoing industry trends offset by competitive price reductions in the acquired csk stores and the addition of a wider assortment of entry level products in those stores 

store growth 

we opened 149 new o’reilly branded stores and one new schuck’s store in 2009 at december 31 2009 we operated 3421 stores compared to 3285 stores at december 31 2008 due to the acquisition and integration of csk we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to 150 new stores in 2010 excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of csk however we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 699 million or 43 from 163 billion 455 of sales in 2008 to 233 billion 480 of sales in 2009 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired csk stores in 2009 versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired csk stores in 2008 the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost changes in our product mix distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of csk we anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in 2010 from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired csk stores throughout the year we improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution additionally gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to diy customers prior to the acquisition of csk our mix of sales to diy customers was approximately equal to sales to professional service provider customers at the time of the acquisition in july of 2008 acquired csk stores generated more than 90 of their total sales from diy customers the addition of the acquired csk stores’ predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately 65 diy and 35 professional service provider in 2009 core o’reilly stores derived approximately 53 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 47 from our professional service provider customers while acquired csk stores derived approximately 84 of sales from our diy customers and approximately 16 from our professional service provider customers sales to diy customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional service providers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional service providers in addition we have added our private label product lines to the acquired csk stores inventory mix private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies the reductions in commodity prices without corresponding decreases in retail pricing that we experienced in 2009 returned to more normal levels by the end of 2009 and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in 2010 additionally in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers “dc” in our western markets we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new dc team members become proficient with the o’reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system 

selling general and administrative expense 

sga increased 497 million or 38 from 129 billion 361 of sales in 2008 to 179 billion 369 of sales in 2009 the dollar increase in sga expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of csk and new stores the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired csk stores which have a higher expense structure than the core o’reilly store base and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing productline changeovers for acquired csk stores these increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the csk headquarters operations in phoenix arizona to our facilities in springfield missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales 

operating income 

operating income in 2009 increased 202 million or 60 from 336 million or 94 of sales in 2008 to 538 million or 111 of sales in 2009 representing an increase of 60 

  

interest expense 

interest expense increased 19 million from 26 million or 07 of sales in 2008 to 45 million or 09 of sales in 2009 the increase in interest expense is the result of a fullyear of borrowings under our credit facility in 2009 that was used to fund the acquisition of csk in 2008 the opening of new stores ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of csk the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in 2009 on the nonswapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes other income expense for the year ended december 31 2008 included onetime charges of 4 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the csk acquisition and 7 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes increased from 116 million in 2008 384 effective tax rate to 189 million in 2009 381 effective tax rate the decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the onetime charge to adjust tax liabilities in 2008 relating to the csk acquisition offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where csk stores are located the increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes 

net income 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income increased 121 million or 65 from 186 million in 2008 52 of sales to 307 million in 2009 63 of sales 

earnings per share 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2009 increased 51 to 223 on 138 million shares compared to 148 for the year ended december 31 2008 on 125 million shares 

adjustments for nonrecurring and nonoperating events 

our year ended december 31 2008 included onetime and noncash charges related to the july 11 2008 acquisition of csk these charges included onetime costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility a onetime adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of csk a onetime charge to conform the csk team member vacation policy with the o’reilly policy and a noncash charge to amortize the value assigned to csk’s trade names and trademarks which will be amortized over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of csk store locations our year ended december 31 2009 results included a noncash charge to amortize the value assigned to csk’s trade names and trademarks adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges increased 38 to 226 for the year ended december 31 2009 from 164 for the same period one year ago the table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 amounts in thousands except per share data 

 

 the acquisitionrelated adjustments to eps in the above paragraph and table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with gaap we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisitionrelated charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the company’s ongoing core operations management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this 

  

nongaap information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business material limitations of this nongaap measure are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts and amortization of acquisitionrelated trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 as well as our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 amounts in millions 

 

  

      adjusted ebitdar is calculated as the sum of net income interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization rent expense and stock option compensation expense less the charge related to the csk doj investigation and the nonrecurring nonoperating gain related to the settlement of the csk note receivable net of tax for the year ended december 31 2010 

liquidity and related ratios 

our working capital increased 6 from 2009 to 2010 primarily driven by an increased investment in hard parts inventories in the acquired csk stores as we continue to grow and expand the professional service provider business in those markets as well as the additional net inventory investment required by our new store growth total debt decreased 55 and total equity increased 20 from 2009 to 2010 the decrease in total debt was driven by strong cash flow from operations which allowed us to substantially pay down the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility the increase in total equity was due to increased retained earnings resulting from strong net income in 2010 and an increase in additional paidin capital primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefits as well as the impact of share based compensation 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 704 million in 2010 285 million in 2009 and 299 million in 2008 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for the effect of noncash depreciation and amortization charges gainloss on property and equipment deferred income taxes and stock based compensation charges a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in 2009 net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors the decrease in net inventory investment in 2010 as compared to 2009 is the result of the significant investments in 2009 to improve the 

  

inventory availability in the acquired csk stores although our investment in net inventory decreased year over year in 2010 duplicative and excess inventory levels throughout our distribution network have lead to an increase in per store average inventory the average perstore inventory for our stores increased to 057 million as of december 31 2010 from 056 million as of december 31 2009 the increase in other liabilities is principally due to the accrual of the csk doj investigation charge during 2010 which is expected to be paid in 2011 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in 2009 as discussed above which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization expenses the average perstore inventory for our stores increased to 056 million as of december 31 2009 from 048 million as of december 31 2008 as we made significant investments in the acquired csk stores in 2009 to improve the inventory availability during 2011 we will continue to refine the inventory levels in the acquired csk stores and will focus on returning excess quantities to vendors where appropriate and selling through the remainder of the excess quantities on hand in the stores 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 351 million in 2010 411 million in 2009 and 368 million in 2008 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of csk and an increase in payments received on notes receivable capital expenditures were 365 million in 2010 415 million in 2009 and 342 million in 2008 capital expenditures related to the acquisition of csk include the purchase of properties for dcs and costs associated with the conversion of csk stores to the o’reilly brand although we opened four new dcs in 2010 a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these dcs occurred in 2009 as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities the increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the onetime nonrecurring payment received to settle the note receivable acquired from csk increases in cash used in investing activities in both 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to the conversions of acquired csk stores to the o’reilly brand and the properties and facilities for the additional dcs we opened 149 net new stores in 2010 and 150 net new stores in both 2009 and 2008 we plan to open 170 net new stores in 2011 the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition improvements fixtures net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 14 million to 16 million however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 350 million in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 121 million in 2009 and 53 million in 2008 net cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our longterm debt the repayments in 2010 were funded by increased cash provided by operating activities as well as decreased capital expenditures compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans and the associated tax benefit from the exercises 

sources of liquidity 

our longterm business strategy requires capital to open new stores to complete the conversions of the acquired csk stores expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our revolver decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our revolver we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our revolver will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

credit facilities 

on july 11 2008 in connection with the acquisition of csk we entered into a credit agreement for a fiveyear 12 billion secured credit facility arranged by ba the “credit facility” which we used to refinance debt fund the cash portion of the acquisition pay for other transactionrelated expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward this credit facility replaced a previous unsecured fiveyear syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of 100 million 

the credit facility was comprised of a 1075 billion tranche a revolving credit facility and a 1250 million firstinlastout revolving credit facility “filo tranche” on the date of the transaction the amount of the borrowing base available as described in the credit agreement under the credit facility was 105 billion of which we borrowed 588 million we used borrowings under the credit facility to repay certain existing debt of csk repay our 75 million 2006a senior notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility the terms of the credit facility granted us the right to terminate the filo tranche upon meeting certain requirements including no events of default and aggregate projected availability under the credit facility during the year ended december 31 2010 we elected to exercise our right to terminate the filo tranche as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the amount of the borrowing base available under the credit facility was 1071 billion and 1196 billion respectively of which we had outstanding borrowings of 356 million and 679 million respectively the available borrowings under the credit facility were also reduced by standby letters of credit issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of 71 million and 72 million respectively and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under 

  

the credit facility was 644 million and 445 million respectively as part of the credit facility we had pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral and we were subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant with which we complied as of december 31 2010 and 2009 

at december 31 2010 borrowings under the tranche a revolver bore interest at our option at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 100 per annum or libor plus 200 per annum with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds the base rate was equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by ba from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 050 fees related to unused capacity under the credit facility were assessed at a rate of 050 of the remaining available borrowings under the facility subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity in addition we paid customary commitment fees letter of credit fees underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were repaid in conjunction with the issuance of our 2011 4875 senior notes on january 14 2011 as further discussed below 

on january 14 2011 we entered into a new credit agreement for a fiveyear 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolver” arranged by ba and barclays which matures in january of 2016 the revolver includes a 200 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 75 million sublimit for swing line borrowings our ability to draw under the revolving facility is conditioned upon among other things our ability to certify that the representations and warranties contained in the credit agreement are true correct and complete in all material respects and that no event of default has occurred or would result from the proposed extension of credit borrowings under the revolver other than swing line loans bear interest at our option at either the base rate or eurodollar rate both as defined in the agreement plus a margin that will vary from 1325 to 2500 in the case of loans bearing interest at the eurodollar rate and 0325 to 1500 in the case of loans bearing interest at the base rate in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by moody’s investor service inc and standard  poor’s rating services swing line loans made under the revolver bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin described above in addition we will pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments varying from 0175 to 0500 based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by moody’s investor service inc and standard  poor’s rating services the revolver replaced the secured credit facility we entered into on july 11 2008 

6 3  4  exchangeable senior notes 

on july 11 2008 we executed the third supplemental indenture the “third supplemental indenture” to the 6 3  4  exchangeable senior notes due 2025 the “notes” in which we agreed to become a guarantor on a subordinated basis of the 100 million principal amount of the notes originally issued by csk pursuant to an indenture dated as of december 19 2005 as amended and supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated as of december 30 2005 and the second supplemental indenture dated as of july 27 2006 by and between csk auto corporation csk auto inc and the bank of new york mellon trust company na as trustee on december 31 2008 and effective as of july 11 2008 we entered into the fourth supplemental indenture in order to correct the definition of exchange rate in the third supplemental indenture

 on july 1 2010 the notes became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through september 30 2010 the last trading day of our third quarter as provided for in the indentures governing the notes the notes became exchangeable as our common stock closed at or above 130 of the exchange price as defined in the indentures governing the notes for 20 trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on june 30 2010 as a result during the exchange period commencing july 1 2010 and continuing through and including september 30 2010 for each 1000 principal amount of the notes held holders of the notes could if they elected surrender their notes for exchange if the notes were exchanged we would deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and in the event our total exchange obligation exceeded the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged shares of our common stock in respect of that excess the total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each 1000 in principal amount of the notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of approximately 2597 shares of our common stock and approximately 6061 in cash on september 28 2010 certain holders of the notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange 11 million of the principal amount of the notes the cash settlement averaging period as defined in the indentures governing the notes ended on october 27 2010 and on october 29 2010 we delivered 11 million in cash which represented the principal amount of the notes exchanged and the value of partial shares and 92855 shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation concurrently we retired the 11 million principal amount of the exchanged notes on october 1 2010 the notes again became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through december 31 2010 

  

the noteholders had the option to require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on december 15 2010 december 15 2015 or december 15 2020 or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture we had the option to redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after december 15 2010 upon at least 35calendar days notice on november 15 2010 we announced our intention to redeem the notes on december 21 2010 at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the redemption date

4875 senior notes due 2021

debt covenants 

the indenture governing the 2011 4875 senior notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property in each case as set forth in the indenture these covenants are however subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions 

the new revolver contains certain positive and negative debt covenants these covenants include limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the revolver a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 200 times from the closing through december 31 2012 225 times through december 31 2014 and 250 times through maturity and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 300 times from the closing through maturity our consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and stock option compensation expense “ebitdar” to adjusted debt adjusted debt includes outstanding debt outstanding standby letters of credit six times capitalized rent and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of longterm debt as of january 14 2011 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

  

our adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio was 16 times and 24 times as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively under our current financing plan we have a target adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 20 times to 225 times 

 

 the adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio discussed in the paragraph and presented in the table above is not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we do not and nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the csk doj investigation charge the gain from the settlement of the note receivable and the presentation of ebitdar provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations we exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this nongaap information is useful to investors as well material limitations of this nongaap measure are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a costeffective alternative to our existing sources of cash we do not believe however that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans 

on december 29 2000 we entered into a saleleaseback transaction with an unrelated party under the terms of the transaction we sold 90 properties including land buildings and improvements which generated 523 million of cash the lease which is being accounted for as an operating lease provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial tenyear period and two additional successive periods of five years each the resulting gain of 45 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term net rent expense during the initial term is approximately 53 million annually 

in august 2001 we entered into a saleleaseback with o’reillywooten 2001 llp an entity owned by certain affiliates of the company the transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine o’reilly auto parts stores and generated approximately 56 million of cash the transaction did not result in a material gain or loss the lease which has been accounted for as an operating lease calls for an initial term of 15 years with three fiveyear renewal options 

we issued standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million sub limit under the credit facility that reduced our available borrowings those letters of credit were issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit had a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 712 million and 723 million were outstanding at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

contractual obligations 

deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in “other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2011 which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 included commitments for future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 4 “longterm debt” and note 6 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolver 

 

  

     we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including estimated interest and penalties these estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined as of december 31 2010 we recorded a liability of 413 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets all of which was included as a component of “other liabilities” 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories at our stores and dcs to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if unrecorded shrink changed 10 from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2010 the financial impact would have been approximately 06 million or 01 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

 we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on december 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of december 31 2010 nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of o’reilly stock which was a primary input used to determine the company’s market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10 from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 

 

  

   

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 

quarterly results 

the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2010 and 2009 the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown

 recent accounting pronouncements 

in january of 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu no 201006 fair value measurements and disclosures topic 820 improving disclosures about fair value measurements “asu 201006” asu 201006 amends subtopic 82010 requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements such as transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 as well as separate disclosures about activity relating to level 3 measurements asu 201006 clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and input valuation techniques the updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2009 with the exception of the new level 3 activity disclosures which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2010 the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the adoption of the new level 3 guidance is required in 2011 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates we had potential interest rate exposure with respect to the 356 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december 31 2010 however from time to time we had entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure on july 24 2008 october 14 2008 november 24 2008 and january 21 2010 we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts “the swaps” with a total notional amount of 450 million the interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with bbt on july 24 2008 for 100 million matured on august 1 2010 the interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with bbt on october 14 2008 for 25 million and was scheduled to mature on october 17 2010 was terminated at our request on september 16 2010 the interest rate swap transactions we entered into with bbt ba andor suntrust on october 14 2008 totaling 75 million matured on october 17 2010 bringing the total notional amount of swapped debt to 250 million as of december 31 2010 the swaps represented contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 

if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 11 million 07 million after tax based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our variable interest rate credit facilities management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 

the interest rate contracts are derivative instruments which have been designated as cash flow hedges we do not hold or issue derivative financials instruments for trading purposes 

all of the interest rate swap transactions that existed as of december 31 2010 for a total notional amount of 250 million were terminated at the company’s request on january 14 2011 concurrent with the closing and issuance of our 2011 4875 senior notes

 item 1 business tableend introduction 

o’reilly automotive inc and its subsidiaries collectively “o’reilly” or the “company” is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself “diy” customers and professional installers o’reilly automotive inc was incorporated in 1957 as a corporation the company was founded by charles f o’reilly and his son charles h “chub” o’reilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri the company’s common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “orly” 

at december 31 2009 we operated 3421 stores in 38 states our stores carry an extensive product line including but not limited to the products bulleted below we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations 

 

  

  

  

 on july 11 2008 we completed the acquisition of csk one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest such retailers in the united states based on store count pursuant to the merger agreement each share of csk common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 04285 of a share of o’reilly common stock and 100 in cash to fund the transaction we entered into a credit agreement “abl credit agreement” for a 12 billion assetbased revolving credit facility “abl credit facility” arranged by bank of america na “ba” which we used to refinance debt fund the cash portion of the acquisition pay for other transactionrelated expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward the results of csk’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 

at the date of the acquisition csk had 1342 stores in 22 states operating under four brand names checker auto parts schuck’s auto supply kragen auto parts and murray’s discount auto parts this acquisition added stores in twelve new states alaska arizona california colorado hawaii idaho michigan nevada new mexico oregon utah and washington and a number of new markets in states where o’reilly had a presence prior to the acquisition the integration of csk is focused on the implementation of our dual market strategy the ability to effectively serve both diy customers and professional installers which requires conversion of store and distribution information systems enhancements to the distribution infrastructure inventory offerings and infusion of the o’reilly culture conversion of all csk stores to o’reilly branded stores began in october of 2008 and will continue into 2011 in order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the csk store network we have added a distribution center in seattle washington in november of 2009 and moreno valley california in january of 2010 and will add distribution centers in denver colorado and salt lake city utah in the first half of 2010 as of december 31 2009 we had converted 405 csk stores to o’reilly systems merged 41 csk stores with existing o’reilly locations closed 13 csk stores and opened five new stores in csk historical markets 

see “risk factors” beginning on page 14 for a description of certain risks relevant to our business these risk factors include among others risks related to our growth strategy the integration of csk increased debt levels our acquisition strategies competition in the 

  

automotive aftermarket business our dependence upon key and other personnel future growth assurance our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions legal proceedings and related matters arising from csk the effect of sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results the volatility of the market price of our common stock our relationships with key vendors and availability of key products complications in our distribution centers and environmental legislation and regulations 

our business 

our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy we remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and core o’reilly values of customer service and expense control our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing significant value to both installer and diy customers 

competitive advantages 

proven ability to execute a dual market strategy we have an established track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy customers and professional installers we believe our ability to execute a dual market strategy is a competitive advantage the execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts by capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure by operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors as well as by enhancing service levels offered to diy customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional installers 

we have been committed to our dual market strategy for over 30 years in 2009 core o’reilly stores derived approximately 53 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 47 from our professional installer customers as a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our over 450 fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional installer we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional installers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who derive a high concentration of their sales from the diy market in 2009 acquired csk stores derived approximately 84 of sales from our diy customers and approximately 16 from our professional installer customers we have a tremendous opportunity to build on the strong retail base at the csk stores by growing the commercial business through the implementation of our dual market strategy and capitalizing on our other competitive advantages 

superior customer service we seek to attract new diy and professional installer customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

 technically proficient professional parts people our highly proficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technically oriented professional installers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic distribution systems we believe our commitment to a robust regional distribution center network provides for superior replenishment and access to hardtofind parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to a distribution center providing for efficient inventory control and management our distribution system provides each of our stores excluding the nonconverted csk stores with sameday or overnight access to an average of 118000 stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hard to find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers distribution infrastructure enhancements are a key component to the csk integration plan and will enable us to support the acquired store network with the same inventory availability provided to our historic o’reilly markets we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

we currently operate 21 distribution centers including two acquired in the csk acquisition and our newly opened greensboro north carolina seattle washington and moreno valley california distribution centers in 2010 we will open additional distribution 

  

centers in denver colorado and salt lake city utah to help support the acquired csk stores in the west as these new distribution centers open the acquired csk stores in those areas will begin to convert to o’reilly systems and will begin receiving sameday or overnight access to an average of 118000 skus 

experienced management team our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan including the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions we have experienced seventeen consecutive years of record revenues and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april of 1993 we have a strong senior management team comprised of 133 professionals who average 16 years of service in addition our 191 corporate managers average 13 years of service and our 311 district managers average 10 years of service 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores we intend to continue to open new stores to achieve greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 150 stores in 2010 – a majority of these sites have been identified to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores either by i constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store or iii purchasing multistore chains store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities other competing auto parts stores other competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe that we have competed effectively and that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within these markets we also believe that with our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas within our geographic footprint which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket consequently we also expect to continue to open new stores in less densely populated market areas 

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional installer resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented we believe the ability of national retail chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation thus our intention is to continue to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive products supplier 

continually enhance store design and location our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional installers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

grow professional installer relationships in the western united states in order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the csk store network and grow our share of the professional installer market in those areas we opened distribution centers in seattle washington in november of 2009 and moreno valley california in january of 2010 we will open two new distribution centers in denver colorado and salt lake city utah in the first half of 2010 the seattle moreno valley and denver distribution centers were existing facilities we purchased and ranged in size from 222000 to 407000 square feet the salt lake city distribution center will be constructed and total approximately 205000 square feet after evaluation of the existing csk dixon california distribution center we made the decision to relocate this distribution center to a larger facility in stockton california the stockton california distribution center will be a 520000 square foot leased facility that will open in the summer of 2010 these strategically located distribution centers will provide converted csk stores with sameday or overnight delivery access to an average 

  

of 118000 skus and will give these stores an important tool to provide industryleading customer service to the professional installer as well as the diy customer our expanded distribution network will provide access to the breadth of skus needed to succeed in the professional installer side of the business and will be a very meaningful service enhancement for our retail customers as well 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to parts specialists retail andor installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of that store each of our 311 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 11 stores which provides our stores with the appropriate amount of operational support 

each district manager receives continuous comprehensive training throughout their management tenure through training sessions and meetings with their regional managers these training sessions and meetings focus on management techniques new product announcements advanced automotive systems training and our policies and procedures in turn the information presented at such training sessions and meetings is covered by the district managers at monthly meetings with their store managers all store managers are required to successfully complete a sixmonth managertraining program which includes classroom and field training this program covers all facets of store operations as well as principles of successful management in addition all new or prospective managers attend a manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri which includes 40 hours of classroom training upon returning to the stores managers are given continuous field training throughout their management tenure 

we provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store team members through incentive compensation programs under our incentive compensation programs base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon their individual andor store’s sales and profitability in addition each of our district and store managers participates in the company’s stock option program we believe that our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our district and store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

most of our current senior management district managers and store managers were promoted to their positions from within the company our senior management team averages 16 years of service corporate management team averages over 13 years of service and district management team have an average length of service of over 10 years 

team members 

as of january 31 2010 we employed 44822 total team members 30379 fulltime team members and 14443 parttime team members of whom 37517 were employed at our stores 5756 were employed at our distribution centers and 1549 were employed at our corporate and regional offices a union represents 53 stores’ team members in the greater bay area in california and has for many years – except for these team members our team members are not represented by a labor union our tradition of 53 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “live green” culture which emphasizes the importance of every team member’s contribution to the success of o’reilly this focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industryleading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increases due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters of the year 

regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

  

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil and battery recycling programs we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates deposited into vendorsupplied containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty vendors in general our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the vendor 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date we cannot give any assurance however that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation

store operations 

store network 

store locations as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket the following table sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores 

 

   

our stores on average carry approximately 22000 skus and average approximately 7000 total square feet in size at december 31 2009 we had a total of approximately 242 million square feet in our 3421 stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest distribution center but they also have access to the broader selection of inventory available at one of our 196 master inventory stores which on average carry approximately 38000 skus and average approximately 9900 square feet in size in addition to serving diy and professional installer customers in their markets master inventory stores also provide our other stores within the contiguous area access to a greater selection of skus on a sameday basis 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings and prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and proximity to our installer customers 

store layout we utilize a computerassisted “planogrammed” store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent merchandise presentation however each store’s hardparts inventory assortment is customized to meet the specific needs of a particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays and end caps are used to feature highdemand or seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation to enhance storelevel operations customer service and reliability we use ibm iseries and xseries computer systems in stores that have converted to the o’reilly systems these systems are linked with the iseries computers located in each of our distribution centers our pointofsale terminals provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to graphically display parts and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and use bar code scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency as csk stores are converted to o’reilly stores ibm iseries and xseries computer systems are installed in the converted store linking the store to our distribution centers electronic catalog and pricing information 

new store site selection in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

products and purchasing 

our stores offer diy and professional installer customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco armor all bwd cardone castrol federal mogul gates rubber monroe moog pennzoil prestone quaker state stp turtle wax valvoline wagner and wix in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality private label products under our besttest ®  brakebest ®  master pro ®  microgard ®  murray and omnispark ®  o’reilly auto parts ®  power torque ®  super start ®  and ultima ® proprietary name brands our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value – a characteristic important to our diy customers we have added o’reilly branded chemicals and commodities as well as proprietary private label products to all converted and nonconverted acquired csk stores these stores have also undergone hardpart resets which significantly increased their hardpart sku offering giving our customers in all stores a good better and best product offering 

  

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24 of our total purchases in 2009 our largest vendor in 2009 accounted for approximately nine percent of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately three to four percent of such purchases we have no longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors during 2009 we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good 

pricing 

we believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area 

we have repositioned the product offering and pricing in all csk stores to an everyday low price strategy to ensure we are competitive in every market we feel competitive pricing is needed to grow our market share and maintain a customer’s repeat business and we feel strongly that this strategy is more sustainable requires less promotional spending and will produce better results than csk’s historical promotionalbased highlow pricing strategy 

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional installer customers because a significant portion of our business is from installers our professional parts people are required to be technically proficient in automotive products in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from a professional parts person particularly when purchasing hard parts the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs or automotive aptitude new store team members go through a comprehensive orientation about the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position additionally during their first year of employment our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems training to prepare them to become certified by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase parts specialists also receive ongoing product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers 

all of our stores have the ability to service professional installer customers for this reason select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with their regional field sales manager afterward these team members spend one day per week calling on existing and potential professional installer customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional installer customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each o’reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace 

marketing 

marketing to the diy customer we aggressively promote sales to diy customers through an integrated marketing program which includes television radio direct mail and newspaper advertising instore and online promotions and sports and event sponsorships 

  

our marketing activities have resulted in a significant increase in our brand awareness across our geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand and productprice messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases which frequently coincide with key sales events during 2009 we continued to cobrand our advertising in the markets where nonconverted csk stores are located this advertising and marketing is essential to build awareness of the o’reilly brand in those markets to allow for a smoother transition as stores are rebranded in addition to cobranding in these select markets we have cobranded all existing csk advertising programs that have national exposure 

to stimulate sales to race enthusiasts who we believe on an individual basis spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationally televised races and over 1500 grassroots local and regional motorsports events in 38 states during 2009 we continued our partnership with nascar as the official auto parts store of nascar and in the fall of 2009 we sponsored the checker o’reilly auto parts 500 nascar sprint cup race at the phoenix international raceway 

during the fall and winter we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” basketball and the national football league “nfl” we have relationships with over 80 ncaa teams and tournaments resulting in the placement of the o’reilly logo on courts goal stanchions seat backs kick plates and scoring table signs throughout the season o’reilly auto parts radio advertising can be heard in approximately 200 nfl games through our sponsorship of a dozen teams 

in 2009 we continued our dedicated problemsolution messaging strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the long term we expanded our hispanic marketing efforts to capture incremental sales from this dynamic and growing consumer segment 

marketing to the professional installer we have over 450 fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional installer customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional installers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industry leading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional installer accounts by providing the products and services bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 marketing to the independently owned parts store along with the daily operation and management of the distribution centers and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our wholly owned subsidiary “ozark” also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores “jobber stores” throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an o’reilly store ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores 

approximately 183 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from ozark and participate in our parts city auto parts program our proprietary jobber service program as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of the respective logo that is owned by ozark we provide advertising promotional assistance marketing and sales support to parts city auto parts stores purchasing automotive products from ozark in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we offer assistance to parts city auto parts jobber stores by making available computer software for business management and inventory control 

competition 

we compete in both the diy and professional installer portions of the automotive aftermarket we compete primarily with the stores bulleted below 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability price helpfulness of store personnel store layout and convenient and accessible store locations 

distribution system support 

we currently operate 21 distribution centers comprised of approximately 74 million operating square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of distribution center operating square footages our distribution centers are equipped with highly automated material handling equipment which efficiently expedite the movement of our products from the shelves to the loading areas for shipment to each of our stores on a nightly basis the distribution centers utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores in addition to the bar code system employed in our stores each of our stores is connected through secured data transmission technology to our distribution centers and corporate headquarters 

we believe that our distribution system provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory moreover we believe that our ongoing significant capital investments made to expand the network of distribution centers allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution center expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each distribution center we opened a new distribution center in greensboro north carolina in the summer of 2009 to service existing stores in that area and to expand in the midatlantic states we currently have a total growth capacity of approximately 350 stores in our current 21 distribution centers 

in order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the csk store network we added distribution centers in seattle washington in november of 2009 and moreno valley california in january of 2010 following these openings two additional new distribution centers will be opened in denver colorado and salt lake city utah in the first half of 2010 the seattle moreno valley and denver distribution centers were purchased existing facilities while the land for the salt lake city distribution center was purchased and the distribution center is being constructed after a detailed evaluation of the existing csk dixon california distribution center we made the decision to relocate this distribution center to a larger facility in stockton california which will open in the summer of 2010 we closed one csk distribution center in mendota heights minnesota in the spring of 2009 that directly overlapped a larger existing o’reilly distribution center in brooklyn park minnesota

 item 1a risk factors tableend our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forwardlooking statements 

current economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions including the united states and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future although demand for many of our products is nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on discretionary spending by our customers discretionary spending is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions continue to challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions in addition the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on which we rely for merchandise are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities or interest rate swap transactions do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the integration of the operations of csk involves risks and the failure to integrate the operations successfully or in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined company 

the failure of the company to meet the challenges involved in integrating the operations of csk successfully or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could seriously harm our results of operations our ability to realize the benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the timely integration of organizations operations procedures policies and technologies as well as the successful adoption of the o’reilly culture and the retention of key personnel the integration of csk will be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process that even with proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt the company’s business the challenges involved in this integration include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not successfully integrate the operations of csk in a timely manner or not at all and we may not realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the merger to the extent or in the time frame anticipated the anticipated benefits and synergies are based on projections and assumptions not actual experience and assume a successful integration in addition to the integration risks discussed above our ability to realize these benefits and synergies could be adversely affected by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations if we fail to manage the integration of these businesses effectively our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger 

  

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

in conjunction with the acquisition of csk we entered into a new credit facility which significantly increased our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements our substantial debt could have important consequences such as 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative and negative covenants conditions on borrowing subsidiary guarantees and asset and stock pledges a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees which may be more difficult in light of uncertainty created by the acquisition of csk and failure to do so could seriously harm the company 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense employee retention may be a particularly challenging issue in connection with the integration of the acquired csk operations we also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals which may be particularly difficult due to the potential distractions of the merger 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2010 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth strategy” section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our costs and sales 

approximately 30 of our stores are located in texas and california therefore our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding seismic activity and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers in addition our stores located in these coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

legal proceedings and related matters arising from csk could adversely affect us 

as discussed in item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 14 “legal matters” of the consolidated financial statements several of csk’s former officers and employees have been charged by the department of justice “doj” and named in civil actions by the securities and exchange commission “sec” o’reilly has resolved csk’s preacquisition issues with the sec but as set forth in item 3 and note 14 “legal matters” the doj investigation continues and could result in criminal charges being filed against csk we are involved in working toward resolution of these matters under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements csk has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and o’reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters there can be no assurance that the expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of these matters will be covered by csk’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies if we incur significant uninsured expenses in connection with the resolution of the matters described above this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amended subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 

risks related to the company and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect the company’s stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future operating results of the company and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of csk will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our business would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

  

complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect our business 

we operate 21 distribution centers nationwide to support our business if complications arise with any facility or if any facility is severely damaged or destroyed our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands this may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a nightly basis and therefore affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

environmental legislation and regulations could affect our operations such as by increasing fuel prices and therefore increase our operating costs 

initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change have been introduced in the us congress which could adversely impact all industries while it is uncertain whether these will become law additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these mandates if enacted could adversely impact our costs including among other things increasing fuel prices

 item 2 properties tableend the following table provides certain information regarding our administrative offices and distribution centers as of december 31 2009 

 

  

         

             of the 3421 stores that we operated at december 31 2009 1064 stores were owned 2288 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 69 stores were leased from one of three entities owned by o’reilly family members leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with two of the three o’reilly family entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from may 31 2010 to december 31 2029 we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties 

we believe that our present facilities are in good condition are adequately insured and together with those under construction are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our current operations the store servicing capacity of our 21 distribution centers is just over 3800 stores with a growth capacity of over 350 stores our total growth capacity will increase to over 600 stores after the opening of our additional distribution centers in 2010 we believe this growth capacity will be adequate for nearterm store growth

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend o’reilly litigation 

o’reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the company’s business although the company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters it does not currently believe that in the aggregate these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period in addition o’reilly is involved in resolving the governmental investigations that were being conducted against csk prior to its acquisition by o’reilly 

csk preacquisition matters – governmental investigations and actions 

as previously reported the preacquisition sec investigation of csk which commenced in 2006 was settled in may 2009 by administrative order without fines disgorgement or other financial remedies however the doj’s criminal investigation into these same matters remains ongoing in addition the previously reported sec complaint against four 4 former employees of csk for alleged conduct related to csk’s historical accounting practices remains ongoing though one of those former employees died in january 2010 the action filed by the sec on july 22 2009 against maynard l jenkins the former chief executive officer of csk seeking reimbursement from mr jenkins of certain bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to section 304 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as previously reported also continues the previously reported doj criminal complaint against two 2 of the former employees of csk remains ongoing however given the recent death of one 1 of those former employees we expect no further action with respect to such former employee 

  

with respect to the ongoing doj investigation discussed above attorneys from the doj have indicated that as a result of conduct alleged against the former employees as set forth in the pleadings in united states vs fraser et al usdistct dist of ariz case no 209cr00372srb2 the doj is considering whether to file criminal charges against csk o’reilly is engaged in discussions with the doj to attempt to resolve the matter o’reilly cannot predict the outcome of these discussions at this time o’reilly intends to vigorously defend against any such charges if filed the probability of criminal charges being filed against csk or the magnitude of the costs to resolve these issues cannot now be reasonably estimated accordingly the accompanying financial statements do not reflect an accrued liability for this contingency 

several of csk’s former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed as part of or become the subject of criminal administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits as described above certain former employees of csk are the subject of civil and criminal litigation commenced by the government under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements csk has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and o’reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters some of these indemnification obligations and other related costs may not be covered by csk’s insurance policies 

as a result of the csk acquisition o’reilly expects to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to the ongoing doj investigation of csk and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced by the doj and sec of csk’s former employees o’reilly recorded an assumed liability for such fees in the company’s allocation of purchase price of csk of which 207 million remains accrued as of december 31 2009 o’reilly has paid approximately 40 million of such legal costs related to the government investigations and indemnity obligations in 2009 

the foregoing governmental investigations and indemnification matters are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the company’s results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of such matters depending in part upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period however at this time management believes that the ultimate outcome of all of such regulatory proceedings that are pending after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits not contemplated in recorded reserves should not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows

overview 

o’reilly automotive inc is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states we are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers selling our products to both doityourself diy customers and professional installers our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional installer service equipment as of december 31 2009 we operated 3421 stores in 38 states 

operating within the retail industry we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer preferences and spending habits and competition the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our company and the retail sector in general we cannot predict whether when or the manner in which these economic conditions will change 

we believe that the number of us miles driven number of us registered vehicles average vehicle age new light vehicle sales unperformed maintenance and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket 

number of us miles driven and number of us registered vehicles 

total miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell the longterm trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the us has exhibited steady growth over the past decade between 1999 and 2007 the total number of miles driven in the united states increased at an annual rate of approximately 16 according to the department of transportation estimated total number of miles driven declined by 36 in 2008 and increased slightly in 2009 the relatively flat number of miles driven during 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to lower fuel costs compared to those in 2008 but the overall decrease in miles driven in recent years is a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions the total number of registered vehicles on the road increased from 201 million light vehicles in 1999 to 242 million in 2008 we believe that the decrease in miles driven in 2008 and the relatively flat number of miles driven in 2009 is a shortterm trend and that longterm miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road 

  

average vehicle age and new light vehicle sales 

changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products as the average age of a vehicle increases the vehicle goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes belts hoses batteries and filters the sales of these products are a key component of our business as reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association “aaia” the average age of the united states vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 91 years for passenger cars and 85 years for light trucks in 1999 to 106 and 93 years respectively in 2008 based on estimates provided by the aaia new car sales decreased 47 between 1999 and 2007 for the light vehicle market however sales for the same market decreased 185 in 2008 due to difficult economic conditions and better engineered vehicles we expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue 

unperformed maintenance 

according to estimates compiled by the aaia the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the united states totaled 50 billion for 2008 this metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand we believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2008 contributed to the amount of unperformed maintenance however with the reduced number of new car sales we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance is decreasing as people place a higher focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment 

product quality differentiation 

we provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects good better and best alternatives our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry we believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “tradedown” to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic conditions we have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future 

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

   

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated 

 

 2009 compared to 2008 

sales increased 127 billion or 36 from 358 billion in 2008 to 485 billion in 2009 the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2009 in millions 

 

 comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain csk branded stores were closed for conversion comparable store sales for stores operating on the o’reilly systems increased 54 for the year ended december 31 2009 the o’reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a 66 increase for the core o’reilly and post conversion schuck’s stores a 21 increase from the 123 converted checker stores and a 119 decrease in comparable stores sales from the 141 converted murray’s stores comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy csk system increased 30 for the year ended december 31 2009 consolidated comparable store sales increased 46 for the year ended december 31 2009 

we believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability a broader selection of products offered in most stores a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers we opened 149 new o’reilly branded stores and one new schuck’s store in 2009 at december 31 2009 we operated 3421 stores compared to 3285 stores at december 31 2008 due to the acquisition and integration of csk we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to 150 new stores in 2010 excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of csk however we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future 

  

gross profit increased 699 million or 43 from 163 billion 455 of sales in 2008 to 233 billion 480 of sales in 2009 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired csk stores in 2009 versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired csk stores in 2008 the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost changes in our product mix distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of csk we anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in 2010 from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired csk stores throughout the year we improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution additionally gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to diy customers prior to the acquisition of csk our mix of sales to diy customers was approximately equal to sales to professional installer customers at the time of the acquisition in july of 2008 acquired csk stores generated more than 90 of their total sales from diy customers the addition of the acquired csk stores’ predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately 65 diy and 35 professional installer in 2009 core o’reilly stores derived approximately 53 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 47 from our professional installer customers while acquired csk stores derived approximately 84 of sales from our diy customers and approximately 16 from our professional installer customers sales to diy customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional installers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional installers in addition we have added our private label product lines to the acquired csk stores inventory mix private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies the reductions in commodity prices without corresponding decreases in retail pricing that we experienced in 2009 returned to more normal levels by the end of 2009 and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in 2010 additionally in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers in our western markets we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new distribution center team members become proficient with the o’reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system 

sga increased 497 million or 38 from 129 billion 361 of sales in 2008 to 179 billion 369 of sales in 2009 the dollar increase in sga expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of csk and new stores the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired csk stores which have a higher expense structure than the core o’reilly store base and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing productline changeovers for acquired csk stores these increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the csk headquarters operations in phoenix arizona to our facilities in springfield missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales 

interest expense increased 19 million from 26 million or 07 of sales in 2008 to 45 million or 09 of sales in 2009 the increase in interest expense is the result of a fullyear of borrowings under our assetbased revolving credit facility in 2009 that was used to fund the acquisition of csk in 2008 the opening of new stores ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of csk the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in 2009 on the nonswapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our assetbased revolving credit facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes other income expense for the year ended december 31 2008 included onetime charges of 42 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the csk acquisition and 72 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility 

our provision for income taxes increased from 116 million in 2008 384 effective tax rate to 189 million in 2009 381 effective tax rate the decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the onetime charge to adjust tax liabilities in 2008 relating to the csk acquisition offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where csk stores are located the increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income increased 121 million from 186 million in 2008 52 of sales to 307 million in 2009 63 of sales 

our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31 2009 increased 51 to 223 on 1379 million shares compared to 148 for the year ended december 31 2008 on 1254 million shares our year ended december 31 2008 included onetime and noncash charges related to the july 11 2008 acquisition of csk these charges included onetime costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility a onetime adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of csk a onetime charge to conform the csk team member vacation policy with the o’reilly policy and a noncash charge to amortize the value assigned to csk’s trade names and trademarks which will be amortized 

  

over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of csk store locations our year ended december 31 2009 results included a noncash charge to amortize the value assigned to csk’s trade names and trademarks adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges increased 38 to 226 for the year ended december 31 2009 from 164 for the same period one year ago the table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in thousands except per share data 

 

 the acquisitionrelated adjustment to eps in the above paragraph and table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with gaap we do not nor do we suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information we believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisitionrelated charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the company’s ongoing core operations management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this nongaap information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business material limitations of this nongaap measure are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts and amortization of acquisitionrelated trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years we compensate for such limitations by presenting in the table above the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

2008 compared to 2007 

sales increased 105 billion or 42 from 252 billion in 2007 to 358 billion in 2008 due to the acquisition of 1342 csk stores and the addition of 150 net new o’reilly stores opened during 2008 the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2008 in millions 

 

 we believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability a broader selection of products in most stores targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 15 for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase in 2008 was less than the prior year’s increase of 37 and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2008 as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the csk acquisition the external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers’ discretionary income resulting from inflation declining home and investment asset values higher gas prices in early 2008 increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the us economy 

  

comparable store sales for o’reilly stores including csk stores after conversion to the o’reilly brand but excluding the acquired yettobeconverted csk stores increased 26 for the year ended december 31 2008 comparable store sales for acquired csk stores open at least one year decreased 17 for the portion of those stores’ sales since the july 11 2008 acquisition by o’reilly as compared to the same period in 2007 when csk’s sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements we anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future we expect future sales growth as the csk stores are converted to the o’reilly dual market strategy comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members gross profit increased 508 million or 45 from 112 billion 444 of sales in 2007 to 163 billion 455 of sales in 2008 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of csk the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements we improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution additionally gross margin percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of csk gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing o’reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion of these sales are made to diy customers which typically have higher gross margin percentages and because of market conditions primarily overall price levels which are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are located product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lowercost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies 

sga increased 477 million or 59 from 815 million 323 of sales in 2007 to 129 billion 361 of sales in 2008 the dollar increase in sga expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of csk and from additional team members and resources to support our increased store count the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the csk store base which has a higher expense structure than the core o’reilly store base a onetime charge of 96 million to align csk’s vacation policy with the company’s policy 53 million of noncash amortization of csk trade names and trademarks and partial deleverage of fixed sga expenses on low comparable store sales increases 

interest expense increased 22 million from 4 million or 01 of sales in 2007 to 26 million or 07 of sales in 2008 the increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new assetbased revolving credit facility that were used to fund the csk acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs other onetime charges were incurred in 2008 of 42 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the csk acquisition and 72 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility 

our provision for income taxes increased from 114 million in 2007 369 effective tax rate to 116 million in 2008 384 effective tax rate the increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of csk and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired csk stores are located the increase is also attributable to a onetime charge to adjust tax liabilities in the amount 31 million relating to the acquisition 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income decreased 8 million from 194 million in 2007 77 of sales to 186 million in 2008 52 of sales diluted earnings per share decreased 019 per share in 2008 to 148 per share on 1254 million diluted shares outstanding from 167 per share in 2007 on 1161 million diluted shares outstanding the increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of csk 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 as well as our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007  in thousands 

 

  

     liquidity and related ratios 

current assets increased 19 from 2008 to 2009 primarily driven by increased investment in inventory as part of the process to properly align the acquired csk stores with o’reilly branded stores’ inventory levels and selection current liabilities increased 17 from 2008 to 2009 primarily attributable to the presentation of our acquired 6 3  4  exchangeable notes as shortterm debt due to the noteholders’ right to require our repurchase of the notes in 2010 and an increase in accounts payable stemming from our increased inventory investment total working capital increased 21 from 2008 to 2009 principally as a result of our investment in inventory offset by the related increase in accounts payable as discussed above total debt increased 8 and total equity increased 18 from 2008 to 2009 the increase in debt is primarily attributable to increased borrowing levels under our abl facility to support the integration and conversion of csk the increase in total equity is principally due to a 23 increase in retained earnings resulting from net income in 2009 and an increase in additional paidin capital of 10 primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 285 million in 2009 299 million in 2008 and 299 million in 2007 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in 2009 which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization expenses net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was flat with the cash provided by operating activities in 2007 principally because an increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization expenses and a onetime noncash charge of 96 million to align where possible csk’s vacation policy with the company’s policy net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors the increases in net inventory investment in 2008 and 2009 were the result of investments made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of csk the average perstore inventory for core o’reilly stores increased to 498000 as of december 31 2009 from 489000 as of december 31 2008 nonconverted csk store’s average perstore inventory increased to 595000 as of december 31 2009 from 461000 as of december 31 2008 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 411 million in 2009 368 million in 2008 and 300 million in 2007 increases in cash used in investing activities in both 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to conversions of acquired csk stores to the o’reilly brand and additional distribution centers capital expenditures were 415 million in 2009 342 million in 

  

2008 and 283 million in 2007 the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the purchase of two distribution center facilities and land for an additional distribution center in our western markets to enhance the distribution infrastructure the conversion of 354 acquired csk stores to o’reilly systems the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition and in the integration of csk partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for new store construction we opened 150 150 and 190 net stores in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

in 2010 we plan to open 150 new stores convert 888 acquired csk stores to o’reilly systems open three new distribution centers in the west relocate and convert an existing acquired csk distribution center to o’reilly systems and convert an existing acquired csk distribution center to o’reilly systems the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition improvements fixtures net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 13 million to 15 million however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site capital costs associated with the conversion of csk stores include investments in store computer systems signage fixtures interior and exterior renovation and delivery vehicles the average estimated capital conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately 135000 total capital expenditures in 2010 are expected to range from 400 million to 450 million 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 121 million in 2009 53 million in 2008 and 19 million in 2007 the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was the result of a reduction in payments on long term debt in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily relating to the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of csk in 2008 and an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans along with the increase in the associated tax benefit from the exercises partially offset by reduced borrowings under our assetbased credit facility the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our assetbased credit facility which was partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt and debt assumed in the csk acquisition debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of csk 

sources of liquidity 

our current business strategy requires capital to open new stores convert acquired csk stores expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our abl credit facility decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations additionally decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our abl credit facility in 2010 we plan to open 150 new stores and open three new distribution centers in our western markets we also plan to relocate an existing acquired csk distribution center in northern california to a larger facility and plan to convert our acquired phoenix distribution center to o’reilly systems in addition we plan to convert 888 acquired csk stores to o’reilly systems in 2010 we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our abl credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however if our liquidity is insufficient we may be forced to limit our planned expansion in 2010 there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 

credit facility 

on july 11 2008 in connection with the acquisition of csk we entered into a credit agreement for a fiveyear 12 billion assetbased revolving credit facility “abl credit facility” arranged by bank of america na which we used to refinance debt fund the cash portion of the acquisition pay for other transactionrelated expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward this facility replaced a previous unsecured fiveyear syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of 100 million

 borrowings under the tranche a revolver bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 125 per annum or libor plus 225 per annum with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds borrowings under the filo tranche bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 25 per annum or libor plus 35 per annum with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds the base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by bank of america from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 125 fees related to unused capacity under the abl credit facility are assessed at a rate of 0375 of the remaining available borrowings under the facility subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity in addition we paid customary commitment fees letter of credit fees underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility 

on july 24 2008 october 14 2008 november 24 2008 and january 21 2010 we entered into interest rate swap transactions with bbt ba suntrust andor barclays we entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on libor on an aggregate of 500 million of our debt that is outstanding under our abl credit agreement dated as of july 11 2008 we are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount the interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of our debt which exists under the credit agreement plus an applicable margin under the terms of the same credit facility the interest rate swap transactions have maturity dates ranging from august 1 2010 through october 17 2011 the interest rate swap transaction we entered into with suntrust on november 24 2008 was for 50 million and matured on november 28 2009 increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount of 400 million as of december 31 2009 on january 21 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with barclays in the amount of 50 million reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount of 450 million as of that date 

senior exchangeable notes 

on july 11 2008 we agreed to become a guarantor on a subordinated basis of the 100 million principal amount of 6 3  4  exchangeable senior notes due 2025 the “notes” originally issued by csk the notes are exchangeable under certain circumstances into cash and shares of our common stock the notes bear interest at 675 per year until december 15 2010 and 650 until maturity on december 15 2025 prior to their stated maturity the notes are exchangeable by the holders only under the following circumstances as more fully described in the indenture under which the notes were issued 

 

  

  

 upon exchange of the notes we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged shares of our common stock in respect of that excess the total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each 1000 in principal amount of the notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of 259697 shares of our common stock and 606061 in cash the incremental net shares for the notes exchange feature were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended december 31 2009 however the incremental net shares for the notes exchange feature were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended december 31 2008 as the impact would have been antidilutive 

the noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on december 15 2010 december 15 2015 or december 15 2020 or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture we may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after december 15 2010 upon at least 35calendar days notice our intention is to redeem the notes in december of 2010 and we plan to fund the redemption with available borrowings under our abl credit facility 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements we have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a costeffective alternative to our existing sources of cash we do not believe however that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans 

on december 29 2000 we entered into a saleleaseback transaction with an unrelated party under the terms of the transaction we sold 90 properties including land buildings and improvements which generated 523 million of cash the lease which is being accounted for as an operating lease provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial tenyear period and two additional successive periods of five years each the resulting gain of 45 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term net rent expense during the initial term is approximately 55 million annually 

in august 2001 we entered into a saleleaseback with o’reillywooten 2000 llc an entity owned by certain affiliates of the company the transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine o’reilly auto parts stores and generated approximately 56 million of cash the transaction did not result in a material gain or loss the lease which has been accounted for as an operating lease calls for an initial term of 15 years with three fiveyear renewal options 

on september 28 2007 we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our 49 million synthetic operating lease facility with a group of financial institutions the terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years a residual value guarantee of approximately 397 million at december 31 2007 and purchase options on the properties on july 11 2008 in connection with the acquisition of csk we purchased all the properties included in our synthetic operating lease facility for 493 million thus terminating the facility the purchase was funded through borrowings under the abl credit facility 

on july 11 2008 and as a result of the acquisition we entered into a master lease agreement with ari fleet lt “ari” which was originally entered into on march 19 2001 by csk the lease agreement with ari is for the lease of all of csk’s delivery and management vehicles which is accounted for as a capital lease under the master agreement a lease contract is created on each vehicle with terms typically ranging from 50 to 60 months interest expense on the capital lease totaled 03 million for each of the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 at december 31 2009 and 2008 the book value of the ari master lease agreement was 39 million and 74 million respectively 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million sub limit under the abl credit facility that reduce our available borrowings these letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 723 million and 556 million were outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

contractual obligations 

deferred income taxes selfinsurance accruals interest payments on our variable rate longterm debt and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in “other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms due to the absence of scheduled maturities the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2010 which are included in “current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 

our contractual obligations at december 31 2009 included commitments for future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in note 4 “longterm debt” and note 6 “commitments” to the consolidated financial statements we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business through borrowings under our abl credit facility or through future borrowings 

 

 we may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after december 15 2010 upon at least 35calendar days notice our intention is to redeem the notes in december of 2010 and we plan to fund the redemption with available borrowings under our abl credit facility 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

 

   

  

  

  

 we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers to 

  

  

 we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on december 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values we have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs however we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of december 31 2009 nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing if the price of o’reilly stock which was a primary input used to determine the company’s market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing changed by 10 from the value used during testing the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 

 

  

 inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

  

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters of the year

the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2009 and 2008 the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown

 recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued the consolidation topic “asc 810” of the fasb asc which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 asc 810 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent asc 810 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary the provisions of asc 810 were effective for us beginning january 1 2009 and are applied prospectively the adoption of asc 810 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2008 the fasb issued the derivatives and hedging topic “asc 815” of the fasb asc which requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments as well as any details of creditriskrelated contingent features contained within derivatives asc 815 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements how the provisions of asc 815 have been applied and the impact that hedges have on an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows asc 815 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 with early application encouraged we have adopted the provisions of asc 815 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended march 31 2009 

in may 2008 the fasb issued the debt with conversions and other options topic “asc 470” of the fasb asc which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent 

  

periods asc 470 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity if certain criteria are met and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations asc 470 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2008 with early application prohibited we adopted the provisions of asc 470 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended march 31 2009 however the retrospective adoption of asc 470 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see note 4 “longterm debt” to the consolidated financial statements 

in april 2009 the fasb issued the financial instruments topic “asc 825” of the fasb asc this topic requires quarterly disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of all financial instruments and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june 15 2009 we adopted the provisions of asc 825 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended june 30 2009 the application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore did not have an impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2009 the fasb issued the subsequent events topic “asc 855” of the fasb asc asc 855 incorporates into authoritative accounting literature certain guidance that already existed within generally accepted auditing standards asc 855 addresses events which occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of financial statements under asc 855 as under current practice an entity must record the effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and must disclose but not record the effects of subsequent events which provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date in addition asc 855 requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date asc 855 is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june 15 2009 we adopted the provisions of asc 855 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended june 30 2009 

in june 2009 the fasb issued the generally accepted accounting standards topic “asc 105” of the fasb asc asc 105 defines the fasb asc as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap superseding existing fasb american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” emerging issues task force “eitf” and related accounting literature this standard reorganizes the thousands of gaap pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure also included is relevant securities and exchange commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections asc 105 is effective for reporting periods ended after september 15 2009 we adopted the provisions of asc 105 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended september 30 2009 and our financial statements and related disclosures reflect the newly adopted codification 

in august 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” number 200905 “asu 200905” an update to the fair value measurements and disclosures topic “asc 820” this update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using a a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities andor b an income approach valuation technique or a market approach valuation technique consistent with the principles of asc 820 this update is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance we adopted this update beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended september 30 2009 the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates primarily as a result of borrowings in 2008 to fund the acquisition of csk we have interest rate exposure with respect to the 679 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december 31 2009 however from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure on july 24 2008 october 14 2008 and november 24 2008 we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts “the swaps” with a total notional amount of 450 million the interest rate swap transaction we entered into with suntrust on november 24 2008 was for 50 million and matured on november 28 2009 increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates by 50 million to a total notional amount of 400 million on january 21 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap contract with barclays on an additional 50 million of the company’s outstanding floating rate debt the swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 28 million 17 million after tax based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our assetbased credit facility management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk

o’reilly automotive inc was incorporated in 1957 as a corporation the company was founded by charles f o’reilly and his son charles h “chub” o’reilly sr and initially operated from a single store in springfield missouri 

on july 11 2008 we completed the acquisition of csk one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest such retailers in the united states based on store count each share of csk common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 04285 of a share of o’reilly common stock and 100 in cash to fund the transaction we entered into a credit agreement “abl credit agreement” for a 12 billion assetbased revolving credit facility “abl credit facility” arranged by bank of america na which we used to refinance debt fund the cash portion of the acquisition pay for other transactionrelated expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward the results of csk’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 

at the date of the acquisition csk had 1342 stores in 22 states operating under four brand names checker auto parts schuck’s auto supply kragen auto parts and murray’s discount auto parts this added stores in twelve new states alaska arizona california colorado hawaii idaho michigan nevada new mexico oregon utah and washington and a number of new markets in states where o’reilly had a presence prior to the acquisition the integration of csk is focused on the implementation of our dual market strategy which requires the conversion of the store and distribution information systems enhancements to the distribution infrastructure and inventory offerings and the infusion of the o’reilly culture conversion of all of the csk stores to o’reilly branded stores began in october of 2008 and will continue into 2011 in order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the csk store network we will add four distribution centers in the western united states as of december 31 2008 we had converted 51 csk stores to the o’reilly brand merged 35 csk stores with existing o’reilly locations closed six csk stores and opened four new csk stores

competitive advantages 

proven ability to execute dual market strategy we have an established track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy customers and professional installers we believe our ability to execute a dual market strategy is a competitive advantage execution of this strategy enables us to better compete in the ways bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

 we have been committed to a dual market strategy for over 30 years in 2008 the existing o’reilly stores operating our dual market strategy derived approximately 52 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 48 from our professional installer customers as a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our over 400 fulltime sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to the professional installer we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional installers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who derive a high concentration of their sales from the diy market from the date of acquisition through the end of the year the acquired csk stores derived approximately 90 of sales from diy customers and approximately 10 from professional installer customers we have a tremendous opportunity to build on the strong retail base at the csk stores by growing the commercial business through the implementation of our dual market strategy and capitalizing on our other competitive advantages 

superior customer service we seek to attract new diy and professional installer customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which are bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

 technically proficient professional parts people our highly proficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technically oriented professional installers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic distribution systems we believe that the geographic concentration of our store network in 36 contiguous states and the strategic locations of our distribution centers enable us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to a distribution center providing for efficient inventory control and management our distribution system provides each of our stores excluding the recently acquired and yet to be converted csk stores with sameday or overnight access to over 116000 stock keeping units “skus” many of which are hard to find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers distribution infrastructure enhancements are a key component of the csk integration plan and will enable us to support the acquired store network with the same inventory availability provided to our existing stores we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

  

we currently operate 18 distribution centers including three acquired csk distribution centers and our newly opened lubbock texas distribution center we will close the acquired csk distribution center in minneapolis which directly overlaps with a larger existing o’reilly distribution center we plan to add a total of four distribution centers in the csk markets in addition to a previously planned distribution center in greensboro north carolina the first three of the four distribution centers to be added in the csk market areas will be in the metropolitan areas of los angeles california seattle washington and denver colorado we are currently evaluating sites in utah for the remaining distribution center as these new distribution centers open the acquired csk stores in that area will begin receiving sameday or overnight access to over 116000 skus 

experienced management team our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan including the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions we have experienced sixteen consecutive years of record revenues and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in april 1993 we have a strong senior management team comprised of 177 professionals who average over 17 years of industry experience in addition our 383 corporate managers average over 13 years of industry experience and our 285 district managers average over 12 years of industry experience 

growth strategy 

aggressively open new stores  we intend to continue to open new stores to achieve greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 150 stores in 2009 and a majority of these sites have been identified in selecting sites for new stores we strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas to achieve management advertising and distribution economies of scale 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe that we have competed effectively and that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within these markets we also believe that because of our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas within our geographic footprint which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket consequently we also expect to continue to open new stores in less densely populated market areas 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable store sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition candidates for conversion to o’reilly stores we typically open new stores either by i constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store or iii purchasing multistore chains store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution costs other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities other competing auto parts stores other competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale 

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing o’reilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is essential in the competitive environment of the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional installer resulting from superior customer service which generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented we believe the ability of national retail chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation thus we intend to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive products supplier 

continually enhance store design and location our current prototype store design features enhancements such as increased square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional installers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

  

grow professional installer relationships in the western united states in order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the csk store network and grow the professional installer market in those areas we will add four distribution centers in the western united states these strategically located distribution centers will provide converted csk stores with sameday or overnight delivery access to over 116000 skus and will give these stores an important tool to provide industryleading customer service to the professional installer as well as the diy customer we recently signed purchase contracts to acquire facilities located in the metropolitan areas of los angeles california seattle washington and denver colorado these distribution centers are existing new facilities and range in size from 360000 to 408000 square feet in addition we are currently evaluating sites for the final distribution center which will be located in utah our expanded distribution network will provide access to the breadth of skus needed to succeed in the professional installer side of the business and will be a very meaningful service enhancement for our retail customers as well 

products and purchasing 

our stores offer diy and professional installer customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised premium name brand products such as ac delco moog wagner gates rubber federal mogul monroe prestone quaker state pennzoil castrol valvoline stp bwd cardone wix armor all and turtle wax in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality private label products under our o’reilly auto parts ®  besttest ®  microgard ®  power torque ®  miles ahead ®  super start ®  brakebest ®  ultima ®  master pro ® murray and omnispark ® proprietary name brands our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value – a characteristic important to our diy customers 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 450 vendors the five largest of which accounted for approximately 26 of our total purchases in 2008 our largest vendor in 2008 accounted for approximately 9 of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for four to five percent of such purchases we have no longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors during 2008 we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good 

inflation and seasonality 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters of the year 

store network 

store locations as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to operate profitably in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket the following table sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores 

  

   

the table below sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores by brand as of december 31 2008 

 

 our stores on average carry approximately 19100 skus and average approximately 6900 total square feet in size at december 31 2008 we had a total of approximately 232 million square feet in our 3285 stores the addition of the acquired csk stores resulted in a lower combinedcompany average store sku count and a greater combinedcompany average store square footage amount once all csk stores have been fully integrated we expect the combinedcompany average store sku count will be closer to our historical average of 21000 skus our stores are served primarily by the nearest distribution center but they also have access to the broader selection of inventory available at one of our 150 master inventory stores which on average carry approximately 36400 skus and average approximately 10000 square feet in size in addition to serving diy and professional installer customers in their markets master inventory stores also provide our other stores within the contiguous area access to a greater selection of skus on a sameday basis 

  

store growth during 2008 included additional new o’reilly stores as well as all stores acquired in the acquisition of csk the table below separates 2008 new store growth by brand 

 

 we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking easy customer access and proximity to our installer customers 

store layout we utilize a computerassisted “planogrammed” store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent merchandise presentation however each store’s hardparts inventory assortment is customized to meet the specific needs of a particular market area front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays are used to feature highdemand or seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

store automation to enhance storelevel operations and customer service we use ibm iseries and xseries computer systems in o’reilly branded stores these systems are linked with the ibm as400 computers located in each of our distribution centers our pointofsale terminals provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to graphically display parts and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and use bar code scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency as csk stores are converted to o’reilly stores ibm iseries and xseries computer systems are placed in the converted store linking the store to our distribution centers electronic catalog and pricing information 

new store site selection in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process are bulleted below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

distribution system 

we currently operate 18 distribution centers comprised of approximately 60 million square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of distribution center square footages our distribution centers are equipped with highly automated material handling equipment which expedite the movement of our products from the shelves to the loading areas for shipment to each of our stores on a nightly basis the distribution centers utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores in addition to the bar code system employed in our stores each of our stores is connected through secured data transmission technology to our distribution centers and corporate headquarters 

  

we believe that our distribution system provides industryleading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory moreover we believe that our ongoing significant capital investments made to expand the network of distribution centers allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution center expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each distribution center we expect to open a new distribution center in greensboro north carolina in the summer of 2009 to service existing stores in that area and to expand in the midatlantic states 

in order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the csk store network we will add four distribution centers in the western united states these strategically located distribution centers will provide converted csk stores sameday or overnight delivery access to over 116000 skus and will give these stores an important tool to provide industryleading customer service to both the professional and diy customer we recently signed purchase contracts to acquire facilities located in the metropolitan areas of los angeles california seattle washington and denver colorado for the first three of these distribution centers these distribution centers are new facilities and range in size from 360000 to 408000 square feet in addition we are currently evaluating sites for the final distribution center that will be located in utah we will close one csk distribution center in minneapolis minnesota that directly overlaps with a larger existing o’reilly distribution center 

as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2009 we plan to 

 

  

  

  

  

 marketing 

marketing to the diy customer we aggressively promote sales to diy customers through an integrated marketing program which includes television radio direct mail and newspaper advertising instore and online promotions and sports and event sponsorships our marketing activities have resulted in a significant increase in our brand awareness across our entire geographic footprint we utilize a combination of brand and productprice messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases frequently in connection with key sales events during 2008 we began cobranding our advertising in the markets of the acquired csk stores to begin building awareness of the o’reilly brand in those markets in addition we have cobranded the advertising in all existing csk advertising programs with national exposure 

to stimulate sales to race enthusiasts who we believe on an individual basis spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationally televised races and over 1500 grassroots local and regional motorsports events in 38 states during 2008 we partnered with nascar to become the official auto parts store of nascar in the fall of 2008 and sponsored our first nascar sprint cup race the checker o’reilly auto parts 500 at phoenix international raceway 

during the fall and winter we strategically sponsor national collegiate athletic association “ncaa” basketball and the national football league “nfl” we have relationships with over 100 ncaa teams and tournaments resulting in the placement of the o’reilly logo on courts goal stanchions seat backs kick plates and scoring table signs throughout the season o’reilly auto parts radio advertising can be heard in approximately 200 nfl games through our sponsorship of a dozen teams 

in 2008 we launched a dedicated problemsolution messaging strategy which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their investment over the long term we intensified grand opening promotions to create excitement increase foot traffic and jumpstart sales for each new location 

marketing to the professional installer we have over 400 fulltime o’reilly sales representatives strategically located across our primary market areas each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon selling to and servicing our professional installer customers targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional installers paint and body shops and fleet customers our industry leading first call program enables our sales representatives district managers and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional installer accounts through 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 marketing to the independently owned parts store  along with the operation of the distribution centers and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our wholly owned subsidiary “ozark” also sells automotive products to independently owned parts stores jobber stores throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an o’reilly store ozark operates its own separate marketing program to jobber stores 

approximately 180 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from ozark and participate in the parts city auto parts program our proprietary jobber service program as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts membership through the display of the respective logo that is owned by ozark we provide advertising promotional assistance marketing and sales support to parts city auto parts stores purchasing automotive products from ozark in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we offer assistance to parts city auto parts jobber stores by making available computer software for business management and inventory control 

management structure 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to the installer service specialists and parts specialists and support staff required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 196 o’reilly district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten stores each of our 88 csk district managers has responsibility for an average of 14 stores per district we are in the process of increasing the number of district managers in csk markets this increase will reduce the average number of stores each csk district manager supervises to our historical ten stores which will ensure the stores receive the appropriate amount of operational support 

each district manager receives comprehensive training on a monthly basis focusing on management techniques new product announcements advanced automotive systems and our policies and procedures in turn the information presented at such meetings is covered by the district managers at bimonthly meetings with their store managers all assistant managers and managersintraining are required to successfully complete a sixmonth managertraining program which includes classroom and field training as a prerequisite to becoming a store manager this program covers all facets of store operations as well as principles of successful management in addition all new or prospective managers attend a manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield missouri which includes 40 hours of classroom training upon returning to the stores managers are given continuous field training throughout their management tenure 

we provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store team members through an incentive compensation program under our incentive compensation program base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon their store’s sales and profitability in addition each of our district and store managers participates in the company’s stock option program we believe that our incentive compensation program significantly increases the motivation and overall performance of our professional parts people and our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

most of our current senior management district managers and store managers were promoted to their positions from within the company our senior management team averages 17 years of experience corporate managers average over 13 years of service and district managers have an average length of service of over 12 years 

  

professional parts people 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional installer customers each of our professional parts people is required to be technically proficient in the workings and application of automotive products due to the significant portion of our business represented by the professional installer in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from a professional parts person particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts we believe that the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression during a customer’s visit to our store and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts or repairs or an aptitude for automotive knowledge each person who becomes a team member first participates in an intensive twoday orientation program designed to introduce the team member to our culture and his or her job duties before being assigned specific job responsibilities the successful completion of extensive training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a parts specialist and thus able to work the parts counter at our stores all new parts specialists are required to successfully complete a sixmonth basic automotive systems training course and are then enrolled in a sixmonth advanced automotive systems course for certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which administers national exams for various automotive specialties and requires ase certified specialists to take recertification exams every five years 

each of our stores participates in our sales specialisttraining program under this program selected team members complete two days of extensive sales call training for business development after which these team members will spend one day per week calling on existing and new professional installer customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

customer service 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional installer customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each o’reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace 

pricing 

we believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to compete successfully product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitive shops and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at discounts to the manufacturer’s suggested price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors 

we are repositioning the product offering and pricing in all csk stores to an everyday low price strategy to ensure we are competitive in every market this repositioning is in progress and is occurring prior to and along with store conversions we feel competitive pricing is needed to grow our market share and maintain a customer’s repeat business and we feel strongly that this strategy is more sustainable requires less promotional spending and will produce better results than csk’s historical promotionalbased highlow pricing strategy 

competition 

we compete in both the diy and professional installer portions of the automotive aftermarket we compete primarily with the stores bulleted below

regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property 

as part of our operations we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with for example our oil recycling program we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates deposited into vendorsupplied containers and pallets and then disposed of by the thirdparty vendors in general our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination that may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to offsite properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties when caused by the vendor 

compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date we cannot give any assurance however that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forwardlooking statements 

current economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

worldwide economic conditions have recently deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions including the united states and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future although demand for many of our products is nondiscretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by constraints on discretionary spending by our customers discretionary spending is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control our customers’ purchases including purchases of our products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions if any of these events occur or if unfavorable economic conditions continue to challenge the consumer environment our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers of finished goods logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions in addition the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on which we rely for finished goods are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and provide us with the materials we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities or interest rate swap transactions do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

the integration of the operations of csk involves risks and the failure to successfully integrate the operations or in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined company 

the failure of the company to meet the challenges involved in integrating the operations of csk successfully or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could seriously harm our results of operations our ability to realize the benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the timely integration of organizations operations procedures policies and technologies as well as the successful adoption of the o’reilly culture and the retention of key personnel the integration of csk will be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process that even with proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt the company’s business the challenges involved in this integration include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not successfully integrate the operations of csk in a timely manner or not at all and we may not realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the merger to the extent or in the time frame anticipated the anticipated benefits and synergies are based on projections and assumptions not actual experience and assume a successful integration in addition to the integration risks discussed above our ability to realize these benefits and synergies could be adversely affected by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations if we fail to manage the integration of these businesses effectively our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger 

our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

in conjunction with the acquisition of csk we entered into a new credit facility which significantly increased our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements our substantial debt could have important consequences such as 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative and negative covenants conditions to borrowing subsidiary guarantees and asset and stock pledges a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations for example 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the “competition” section of item 1 of this form 10k 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate key employees which may be more difficult in light of uncertainty created by the acquisition of csk and failure to do so could seriously harm the company 

in order to be successful we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense employee retention may be a particularly challenging issue in connection with the integration of the acquired csk operations we also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals which may be particularly difficult due to the potential distractions of the merger 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

we believe that our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2009 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the “growth and expansion strategies” section of item 1 of this form 10k 

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our sales 

approximately 30 of our stores are located in texas and california therefore our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet freezing rain flooding and hurricanes has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers 

potential indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance could adversely affect us 

as discussed in item 3 legal proceedings and note 14 of the consolidated financial statements several of csk’s former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed as part of or become the subject of criminal administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits we are involved in working toward resolution of these matters involving such persons under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements we may have an obligation to indemnify and are currently incurring expenses on the behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters some of these indemnification obligations may not be covered by our directors’ and officers’ insurance policies if we incur significant uninsured indemnity obligations in the future this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amended subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 

  

risks related to the company and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect the company’s stock price 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future operating results of the company and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of csk will be successful or that it will successfully manage these risks if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties our business would likely suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business

                   of the 3285 stores that we operated at december 31 2008 975 stores were owned 2240 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 70 stores were leased from one of three entities owned by o’reilly family members leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent payment of certain tax insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of at a minimum 10 years subject to one or more renewals at our option we have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements with two of the three o’reilly family entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores the master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from december 31 2009 to december 31 2029 we believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend o’reilly litigation 

o’reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the company’s business although the company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters it does not currently believe that in the aggregate these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results or operations or cash flows in addition o’reilly is involved in resolving the governmental investigations that were being conducted against csk prior to its acquisition by o’reilly further detail regarding such matters is described below 

csk preacquisition matters 

investigations by the sec and department of justice respecting certain historical accounting practices of csk as previously reported and as described below continue o’reilly expects to continue to incur ongoing legal expenses related to the governmental investigations and indemnity obligations and has reserved 73 million as an assumed liability in the company’s preliminary allocation of the purchase price of csk o’reilly has incurred approximately 10 million of such legal costs related to the government investigations and indemnity obligations in the 4 th quarter of 2008 and 13 million in the reporting year legal accounting and audit expenses incurred by csk for the period from february 4 2008 the day after csk’s last filed 10k through july 11 2008 closing of the acquisition under the merger agreement of approximately 28 million were incurred prior to o’reilly’s acquisition of csk and are not reflected in the o’reilly consolidated financial statements 

governmental investigations 

the sec investigation that began in 2006 related to certain historical accounting practices of csk continues on may 1 2008 csk received a notification from the staff of the pacific regional office the “staff” of the sec relating to that investigation on november 6 2008 the staff informed o’reilly that the securities and exchange commission the “commission” agreed with the recommendation of staff to bring charges against csk including charges that csk violated certain provisions of the federal securities laws including section 10b of the exchange act and rule 10b5 the antifraud provisions o’reilly is in discussions with the staff to try to resolve csk’s premerger matters with the staff and the commission but cannot predict whether and when it will be able to reach a resolution 

in addition the us attorney’s office in phoenix the “usao” and the us department of justice in washington dc the “doj” is continuing the investigation related to preacquisition historical accounting practices of csk at this time o’reilly is cooperating with requests from the doj to resolve csk’s premerger matters 

indemnification matters 

several of csk’s former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed as part of or become the subject of criminal administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits we are involved in working toward resolution of these matters involving such persons under delaware law the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements we may have an obligation to indemnify and are currently incurring expenses on the behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters some of these indemnification obligations may not be covered by our directors’ and officers’ insurance policies 

these regulatory proceedings and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the company’s results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these regulatory proceedings or matters subject to indemnification depending in part upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period however at this time management believes that the ultimate outcome of all of these regulatory proceedings and matters subject to indemnification that are pending after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits should not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows

overview 

we are one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts tools supplies equipment and accessories in the united states selling our products to both doityourself diy customers and professional installers our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials automotive tools and professional installer service equipment on july 11 2008 we completed the acquisition of csk one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest such retailers in the united states based on store count at the date of the acquisition csk had 1342 stores in 22 states operating under four brand names checker auto parts schuck’s auto supply kragen auto parts and murray’s discount auto parts 

we view the following factors to be the key drivers of current and future demand for the products we sell 

number of miles driven and number of registered vehicles – the total number of miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell the longterm trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the us has exhibited steady growth over the past decade since 1998 the total number of miles driven in the united states has increased at an annual rate of approximately 16 the total number of vehicles on the road has increased from 197 million registered light vehicles in 1998 to 241 million in 2007 total number of miles driven remained relatively unchanged in 2007 and declined by 36 in 2008 as many consumers responded to rising fuel prices and other economic constraints in part by curtailing automobile usage we believe that the decrease in miles driven in 2008 and expected decrease in 2009 is a shortterm trend and that longterm miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road 

average vehicle age – changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products as the average age of a vehicle increases the vehicle goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes belts hoses batteries and filters the sales of these products are a key component of our business the average age of the vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 89 years for passenger cars and 83 years for light trucks in 1998 to 104 and 90 years respectively in 2007 based on the dramatic decrease in the sale of new cars and light trucks in 2008 and the expected decrease in 2009 we expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue 

unperformed maintenance – according to estimates compiled by the automotive aftermarket industry association the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the united states totaled 60 billion for 2007 this metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand we believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2007 and 2008 contributed to the amount of unperformed maintenance 

product quality differentiation – we provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer for many of our product offerings this quality differentiation reflects “good” “better” and “best” alternatives our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry we believe 

  

that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “tradedown” to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic conditions we have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future 

recent developments 

on july 11 2008 we completed the acquisition of csk one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest such retailers in the united states based on store count pursuant to the merger agreement each share of csk common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 04285 of a share of o’reilly common stock and 100 in cash to fund the transaction we entered into a credit agreement for a 12 billion assetbased revolving credit facility arranged by bank of america na which we used to refinance debt fund the cash portion of the acquisition pay for other transactionrelated expenses and provide liquidity for our combined company going forward the results of csk’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 

at the date of the acquisition csk had 1342 stores in 22 states operating under four brand names checker auto parts schuck’s auto supply kragen auto parts and murray’s discount auto parts this added stores in twelve new states alaska arizona california colorado hawaii idaho michigan nevada new mexico oregon utah and washington and a number of new markets in states where o’reilly had a presence prior to the acquisition as of december 31 2008 we had converted 51 csk stores to o’reilly brands merged 35 csk stores with existing o’reilly locations closed six csk stores and opened four new csk stores 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated 

 

   

2008 compared to 2007 

sales increased 105 billion or 42 from 252 billion in 2007 to 358 billion in 2008 due to the acquisition of 1342 csk stores and the addition of 150 net new o’reilly stores opened during 2008 the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

 we believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability a broader selection of products in most stores targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 15 for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase in 2008 was less than the prior year’s increase of 37 and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2008 as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the csk acquisition the external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers’ discretionary income resulting from inflation declining home and investment asset values higher gas prices in early 2008 increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the us economy comparable store sales for o’reilly stores including csk stores after conversion to the o’reilly brand but excluding the acquired yettobeconverted csk stores increased 26 for the year ended december 31 2008 comparable store sales for acquired csk stores open at least one year decreased 17 for the portion of those stores’ sales since the july 11 2008 acquisition by o’reilly as compared to the same period in 2007 when csk’s sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements we anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future we expect future sales growth as the csk stores are converted to the o’reilly dual market strategy comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members the following table presents quarterly results for nonstore sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable stores sales in millions 

 

 gross profit increased 5075 million or 45 from 112 billion 444 of sales in 2007 to 163 billion 455 of sales in 2008 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of csk the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements we improved our product mix by 

  

continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution additionally gross margin percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of csk gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing o’reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion of these sales are made to diy customers which typically have higher gross margin percentages and because of market conditions primarily overall price levels that are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are located product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lowercost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies we anticipate these trends to continue at a moderate rate in 2009 with more significant improvements resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions relating to the csk acquisition 

sga increased 477 million or 59 from 8153 million 323 of sales in 2007 to 129 billion 361 of sales in 2008 the dollar increase in sga expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of csk and from additional team members and resources to support our increased store count the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the csk store base which has a higher expense structure than the core o’reilly store base a onetime charge of 96 million to align csk’s vacation policy with the company’s policy 53 million of noncash amortization of csk trade names and trade marks and partial deleverage of fixed sga expenses on low comparable store sales increases 

interest expense increased 22 million from 4 million or 01 of sales in 2007 to 26 million or 07 of sales in 2008 the increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new assetbased revolving credit facility that were used to fund the csk acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs other onetime charges were incurred in 2008 of 42 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the csk acquisition and 72 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility 

our provision for income taxes increased from 114 million in 2007 369 effective tax rate to 116 million in 2008 384 effective tax rate the increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of csk and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired csk stores are located the increase is also attributable to a onetime charge to adjust tax liabilities in the amount 31 million relating to the acquisition 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income decreased 78 million from 1940 million in 2007 77 of sales to 1862 million in 2008 52 of sales diluted earnings per share decreased 019 per share in 2008 to 148 per share on 1254 million diluted shares outstanding from 167 per share in 2007 on 1161 million diluted shares outstanding the increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of csk 

  

2007 compared to 2006 

sales increased 239 million or 105 from 228 billion in 2006 to 252 billion in 2007 due to 190 net additional stores opened during 2007 which contributed 725 million to the sales increase a full year of sales for stores opened throughout 2006 adding 835 million and a 37 increase in samestore sales for stores open at least one year providing 826 million of the sales increase we believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores are the result of superior inventory availability offering a broader selection of products in most stores an increased promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers the same store sales increase in 2007 of 37 was greater than the prior year’s increase of 33 but below our historical results the decrease from historical trends is the result of challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2006 and 2007 the external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers’ discretionary income as a result of increased interest rates and higher energy costs consumers also encountered higher gas prices which resulted in annual miles driven a key driver of demand for our products remaining flat in comparison to the longterm trend of annual increases we anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future 

 

 gross profit increased 1137 million or 113 from 101 billion 441 of sales in 2006 to 112 billion 444 of sales in 2007 primarily due to the increase in sales resulting from a larger number of stores and increased sales levels at existing stores the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is the result of improvements in product mix lower product acquisition cost and distribution system efficiencies improvements in product mix were the result of strategies which differentiated our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution product acquisition cost improved due to increased imports from lower cost providers in foreign countries as well as improved negotiating leverage with our vendors resulting from our increased purchasing power improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies we anticipate these trends to continue at a moderate rate throughout 2008 

sga increased 909 million or 126 from 7244 million 317 of sales in 2006 to 8153 million 323 of sales in 2007 the increase in these expenses was primarily attributable to increased salaries and benefits rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to support the increased level of our operations the increase in sga as a percentage of sales was the result of increased store salaries primarily driven by the timing of new store openings higher advertising costs increased depreciation expense primarily driven by investment in new store technology and increased stock compensation expense 

other income net increased by 24 million from 01 million in 2006 to 23 million in 2007 the increase was primarily due to decreased interest expense on longterm debt resulting from a reduction in the interest rate on longterm debt as well as increased interest income derived from a higher than average cash balance 

provision for income taxes increased from 1042 million in 2006 369 effective tax rate to 1135 million in 2007 369 effective tax rate the increase in the dollar amount was due to the increase of income before income taxes 

as a result of the impacts discussed above net income increased 159 million from 1781 million in 2006 78 of sales to 1940 million in 2007 77 of sales diluted earnings per share increased 012 per share in 2007 to 167 per share on 1161 million diluted shares outstanding from 155 per share in 2006 in 1151 million diluted shares outstanding 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2985 million in 2008 2994 million in 2007 and 1859 million in 2006 net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was consistent with the cash provided by operating activities in 2007 principally because an increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization expenses and a onetime noncash charge of 96 million to align where possible csk’s vacation policy with the company’s policy net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors the increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was the result of investments made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of csk the average perstore inventory for core o’reilly stores increased to 489000 as of december 31 2008 from 482000 as of december 31 2007 csk store’s average perstore inventory increased from 417000 at the date of acquisition to 461000 as of december 31 2008 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was due to increased net income and a reduction in net inventory investment the reduction in net inventory investment is the result of reductions in our perstore inventory levels and our ongoing effort to extend terms with our vendors reductions in our perstore inventory levels are driven by our continued optimization of inventory selection at our stores and our ability to efficiently deploy inventory throughout our distribution network 

net cash used in investing activities was 3676 million in 2008 3003 million in 2007 and 2252 million in 2006 the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition of csk capital expenditures were 3417 million in 2008 2827 million in 2007 and 2289 million in 2006 the increase in capital expenditures in 2008 was the result of the july 11 2008 purchase of properties previously leased under our synthetic lease facility in conjunction with the financing of the acquisition of csk the addition of a distribution center facility in lubbock texas cash paid in the construction of a distribution center in greensboro north carolina planned to open in 2009 and capital investments made in the initial stage of our integration of the operations of csk the 2008 increase in capital expenditures from these items was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for new store construction we opened 150 190 and 170 net stores in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to increases in capital expenditures resulting from our increased number of new stores store relocations enhancements in existing store technology and the purchase of 217 million of csk shares these expenditures were primarily related to the opening of new stores and distribution centers as well as the relocation or remodeling of existing stores 

our plan for the integration of the csk acquisition and our continuing store expansion program will require significant capital expenditures and working capital investments in 2009 total capital expenditures in 2009 are expected to range from 420 million to 470 million the csk integration plan will require capital expenditures for the planned addition of facilities to enhance distribution infrastructure and the conversion of acquired stores to the o’reilly brand costs associated with the conversion of csk stores include investments in store computer systems signage fixtures interior and exterior renovation and delivery vehicles the estimated conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately 135000 additionally our 2009 growth plans call for approximately 150 new stores and the addition of a distribution center in greensboro north carolina the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition improvements fixtures net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately 13 million to 15 million however such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease rather than purchase the store site we plan to finance our expansion program through cash expected to be provided from operating activities and available borrowings under our abl credit facility 

net cash provided by financing activities was 528 million in 2008 186 million in 2007 and 378 million in 2006 the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 is primarily the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our assetbased credit facility partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt and debt assumed in the csk acquisition debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of csk the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2007 versus 2006 is due to net repayments of longterm debt 

on july 11 2008 in connection with the acquisition of csk we entered into a credit agreement for a fiveyear 12 billion assetbased revolving credit facility “abl credit facility” arranged by bank of america na which we used to refinance debt fund the cash portion of the acquisition pay for other transactionrelated expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward this facility replaced a previous unsecured fiveyear syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of 100 million 

the abl credit facility is comprised of a 1075 billion tranche a revolving credit facility and a 1250 million firstinlastout revolving credit facility filo tranche as part of the abl credit agreement the company has pledged virtually all of its assets as collateral and is subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant on the date of the transaction the amount of the borrowing base available as described in the abl credit agreement under the abl credit facility was 105 billion of which we borrowed 588 million we used borrowings under the abl credit facility to repay certain existing debt of csk repay our 75 million 2006a senior notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility we believe 

  

that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and our abl credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our shortterm and longterm capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future at december 31 2008 our borrowing base was 1124 billion of which we had borrowed 6142 million 

borrowings under the tranche a revolver bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 150 per annum or libor plus 25 per annum with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds borrowings under the filo tranche bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 275 per annum or libor plus 375 per annum with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds the base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by bank of america from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 050 fees related to unused capacity under the abl credit facility are assessed at a rate of 05 of the remaining available borrowings under the facility subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity in addition we paid customary commitment fees letter of credit fees underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility 

on july 24 2008 october 14 2008 and november 24 2008 we entered into interest rate swap transactions with branch banking and trust company “bbt” bank of america na “ba” and suntrust bank “suntrust” we entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on libor on an aggregate of 450 million of our debt that is outstanding under our abl credit agreement dated as of july 11 2008 we are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount the interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of our debt which may exist under the abl credit facility plus an applicable margin under the terms of the abl credit facility the counterparties transaction dates effective dates applicable notional amounts effective index rates and maturity dates of each of the interest rate swap transactions are included in the table below 

 

 on july 11 2008 o’reilly agreed to become a guarantor on a subordinated basis of the 100 million principal amount of 6 34 exchangeable senior notes due 2025 the “notes” originally issued by csk the notes are exchangeable under certain circumstances into cash and shares of our common stock the notes bear interest at 675 per year until december 15 2010 and 65 until maturity on december 15 2025 prior to their stated maturity the notes are exchangeable by the holders only under certain circumstances prior to their stated maturity these notes are exchangeable by the holder only under the following circumstances as more fully described in the indenture under which the notes were issued 

 

  

  

 upon exchange of the notes we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged shares of our common stock in respect of that excess the total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each 1000 in principal amount of the notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of 259697 shares of our common stock and 606061 in cash 

  

the noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on december 15 2010 december 15 2015 or december 15 2020 or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture we may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after december 15 2010 upon at least 35calendar days notice 

off balance sheet arrangements 

we have utilized various financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost effective alternative to our existing sources of cash we do not believe however that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans 

on december 29 2000 we entered into a saleleaseback transaction with an unrelated party under the terms of the transaction we sold 90 properties including land buildings and improvements which generated 523 million of cash the lease which is being accounted for as an operating lease provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial tenyear period and two additional successive periods of five years each the resulting gain of 45 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term net rent expense during the initial term will be approximately 55 million annually 

in august 2001 we entered into a saleleaseback with o’reillywooten 2000 llc an entity owned by certain affiliates of the company the transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine o’reilly auto parts stores and generated approximately 56 million of cash the transaction did not result in a material gain or loss the lease which has been accounted for as an operating lease calls for an initial term of 15 years with three fiveyear renewal options 

on september 28 2007 we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our 49 million synthetic operating lease facility with a group of financial institutions the terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years a residual value guarantee of approximately 397 million at december 31 2007 and purchase options on the properties on july 11 2008 we in connection with the acquisition of csk purchased all the properties included in our synthetic operating lease facility for 493 million thus terminating the facility the purchase was funded through borrowings under the abl credit facility 

we issue standby letters of credit provided by a 200 million sub limit under the abl credit facility that reduce our available borrowings these letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation general liability and other insurance policies substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a oneyear term from the date of issuance letters of credit totaling 556 million and 286 million were outstanding at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management management bases its assumptions estimates and adjustments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

 

   

  

  

  

   

we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates if unrecorded shrink were changed 10 from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december 31 2008 the financial impact would have been approximately 09 million or 03 of pretax income for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

 under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values the company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill or intangible assets the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value in the future if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired the company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs 

contractual obligations 

we have other liabilities reflected in our balance sheet including deferred income taxes and selfinsurance accruals interest payments on our variable rate longterm debt are not included in the financial commitments table the payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the financial commitments table due to the absence of scheduled payments therefore the timing of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2009 that are included in current liabilities in addition we have commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory as of december 31 2008 the financial commitments table excludes these commitments because they are cancelable by their terms 

our contractual obligations as in effect at december 31 2008 including commitments for future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements short and longterm debt arrangements interest payments related to longterm debt fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments are summarized below and are fully disclosed in notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   

inflation and seasonality 

for the last three fiscal years we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industrywide we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially adversely affected by inflation 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters of the year 

quarterly results 

the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2008 and 2007 the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 

the unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report and the other financial information included therein 

 

  

 new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of sfas no 157 for financial assets and liabilities as well as any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 fiscal year 2008 for us fasb staff position fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 delayed the effective date of sfas no 157 for most nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 fiscal year 2009 for us the implementation of sfas no 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities effective january 1 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we do not anticipate sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities “sfas no 159” sfas no 159 permits entities to measure selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date the provisions of sfas no 159 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year as we elected not to measure any eligible items using the fair value option in accordance with sfas no 159 the adoption of sfas no 159 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r business combinations revised 2007  “sfas no 141r” sfas no 141r applies to any transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination where applicable sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase in addition sfas no 141r determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination this statement is to be applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we do not expect the initial adoption of sfas no 141r to have a material impact however the impact of sfas no 141r on a future business combination could be material and would be evaluated at that time 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no 51 “sfas 160” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 sfas 160 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent sfas 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary the provisions of sfas 160 will be effective for us beginning january 1 2009 and will be applied prospectively we do not expect the adoption of sfas 160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133 “sfas no 161” which requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments as well as any details of creditriskrelated contingent features contained within derivatives sfas no 161 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements how the provisions of fasb statement no 133 have been applied and the impact that hedges have on an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 with early application encouraged we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 161 beginning with our march 2009 interim consolidated financial statements 

in may 2008 the fasb issued fsp accounting principles board opinion no 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement “fsp apb 141” fsp apb 141 clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods fsp apb 141 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the company’s consolidated statement of operations fsp apb 141 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2008 with early application prohibited we will adopt the provisions of fsp apb 141 beginning with our march 2009 interim consolidated financial statements however we do not anticipate that the adoption of fsp apb 141 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 the heirarchy of generally accepted accounting principles “sfas 162” this standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework or hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states sfas 162 is effective 60 days following the sec’s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section 411 “the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates at december 31 2007 we did not have amounts borrowed against our variable rate credit facilities and as a result did not have material market risk exposure primarily as a result of borrowings in 2008 to fund the acquisition of csk we have interest rate exposure with respect to the 614 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december 31 2008 however from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure on july 24 2008 october 14 2008 and november 24 2008 we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts “the swaps” with a total notional amount of 450 million the swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 

  

if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 16 million 10 million after tax based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our assetbased credit facility management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk

competitive advantages 

 

proven ability to execute dual market strategy we have an established track record of effectively serving at a high level both diy customers and professional installers we believe our ability to execute a dual market strategy is a competitive advantage which enables us to 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

we have been committed to a dual market strategy for over 20 years in 2007 we derived approximately 52 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 48 from our professional installer customers as a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our 250 fulltime sales representatives dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to the professional installer we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional installers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who derive a high concentration of their sales from the diy market 

superior customer service we seek to attract new diy and professional installer customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which include 

 

  

technically proficient professional parts people our highly proficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technically oriented professional installers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who value the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

strategic distribution systems we believe that the geographic concentration of our store network in 26 contiguous states and the strategic locations of our 14 distribution centers enable us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network in addition our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to a distribution center providing for efficient inventory control and management our distribution system provides each of our stores with same day or overnight access to over 100000 skus many of which are hard to find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers we believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

experienced management team our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan including the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions we have experienced fifteen consecutive years of record revenues positive comparable store sales results and earnings growth since becoming a public company in april 1993 we have a strong senior management team comprised of 88 professionals who average over 16 years of experience with oreilly in addition our 127 corporate managers average over 13 years of experience with team o’reilly and our 177 district managers average over 10 years of experience 

 

growth strategy 

 

aggressively open new stores  we intend to continue to aggressively open new stores to achieve greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 205 stores in 2008 a majority of the sites for our proposed 2008 store openings have been identified in selecting sites for new stores we strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas to achieve management advertising and distribution economies of scale 

 

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe that we have competed effectively and that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within these markets we also believe that because of our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas within our regional markets which would not otherwise support a national or regional chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket consequently we also expect to continue to open new stores in less densely populated market areas 

 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable store sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition candidates for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new stores either by i constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory or ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution system in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution costs other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts the number and type of existing 

 

 

 

automotive repair facilities other competing auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale 

 

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is essential in the competitive environment of the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional installer resulting from superior customer service which generates increased sales and profitability 

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented we believe the ability of national and regional specialty retail chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation thus we intend to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive products retailer 

 

continually enhance store design and location our current prototype store design features enhancements such as greater square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional installers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

 

products and purchasing 

 

our stores offer diy and professional installer customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised name brand products such as ac delco moog murray wagner gates rubber federal mogul monroe prestone quaker state pennzoil castrol valvoline stp bwd cardone wix armor all and turtle wax in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality private label products under our oreilly auto parts® besttest® microgard® powertorque® miles ahead® superstart® brakebest® ultima® master pro® and omnispark® proprietary name brands because most of our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications we believe that the private label products are generally of equal or in some cases better quality than comparable name brand products a characteristic which is important to our diy customers we further believe that our private label products are packaged attractively to promote customer interest and are generally priced below comparable name brand products carried in our stores 

 

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 400 vendors the five largest of which accounted for approximately 30 of our total purchases in 2007 our largest vendor in 2007 accounted for approximately 11 of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for 46 of such purchases we have no longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors during 2007 we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases as a whole we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good 

 

inflation and seasonality 

 

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 

 

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters 

 

 

 

 

store network 

store locations as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national or regional chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket the following table sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores 

 

our stores on average carry approximately 21000 skus and average approximately 6800 total square feet in size at december 31 2007 we had a total of approximately 124 million square feet in our 1830 stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest distribution center but they also have access to the broader selection of inventory available at one of our 102 master inventory stores which on average carry approximately 34000 skus and average approximately 9100 square feet in size in addition to serving diy and professional installer customers in their markets master inventory stores also provide our other stores within the contiguous area access to a greater selection of skus on a sameday basis 

 

we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking and easy customer access 

store layout we utilize a computerassisted planogrammed store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent merchandise presentation however each store’s inventory assortment is customized to meet the specific needs of a particular market area merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have selectively implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays are used to feature highdemand or seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

 

store automation to enhance store level operations and customer service we use ibm iseries and xseries computer systems in all of our stores these systems are linked with the ibm as400 computers located in each of our distribution centers our pointofsale terminals provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to graphically display parts and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and use bar code scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

 

 

 

 

new store site selection in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include 

 

  

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

 

distribution system 

 

we currently operate 14 distribution centers comprised of approximately 47 million square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of distribution center square footages our distribution centers are equipped with highly automated conveyor systems which expedite the movement of our products to loading areas for shipment to each of our stores on a nightly basis the distribution centers utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores in addition to the bar code system employed in our stores each of our stores is connected through secured data transmission technology to our distribution centers and corporate headquarters 

 

we believe that our distribution system provides industry leading parts availability and store instock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory moreover we believe that our significant capital investments in expanding the network of distribution centers allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network our distribution center expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each distribution center as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2008 we plan to 

 

  

marketing 

 

marketing to the diy customer we aggressively promote sales to diy customers through an integrated marketing program which includes direct mail newspaper television and radio advertising in selected markets sports sponsorships and in event signage we believe that our advertising and promotional activities have resulted in significant brand awareness in each of our geographic markets newspaper and radio advertisements are generally directed toward seasonal product and price promotions frequently in connection with specific sale events or promotions 

to promote sales to race enthusiasts who we believe on an individual basis spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored multiple nationally televised races and over 1500 grassroots to major motor sports races and car shows in 26 states including 3 nascar craftsmen truck series races 2 nascar busch series races 6 national hotrod racing association races as well as the 21 st annual chili bowl midget nationals in addition to sponsorships o’reilly auto parts is the “official auto parts store” of texas motor speedway kansas speedway bristol motor speedway houston raceway park texas motorplex memphis motorsports park heartland park gateway international atlanta dragway o’reilly raceway park at indianapolis darlington raceway and talladega superspeedway 

since 2003 we have aggressively sought to market the o’reilly brand in the national collegiate athletic association our first initiative was to partner with texas tech university and their former head basketball coach bobby knight our success with coach 

 

 

knight let to placement of the o’reilly logo on courts goal stanchions seatbacks and scoring table signs at over 70 colleges and universities across the country o’reilly is the title sponsor of numerous college basketball tournaments and events including the cbe classic allcollege classic and espn’s bracketbusters 

in 2007 we increased programs targeted toward hispanic customers expanded brand awareness campaigns into college and professional football and initiated integrated consumer promotions with the goal of increasing retail traffic in our stores we have found that the more progressive marketing concepts utilized in the diy portion of our business have also resulted in increased awareness for professional installer customers 

 

marketing to the professional installer we have 250 fulltime oreilly sales representatives strategically located across our primary market areas each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon supporting and selling to the professional installer targeted marketing materials such as flyers quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional installers and fleet customers our industry leading first call program includes a dedicated sales force promotions directed solely to the professional installer electronic shop management systems and electronic access to our stores moreover each district manager and store manager throughout our store network calls upon existing and potential new professional installer customers on a regular basis our first call marketing strategy with respect to professional installers emphasizes our ability to offer 

 

  

marketing to the independently owned parts store  along with the operation of the distribution centers and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our wholly owned subsidiary “ozark” also sells automotive products to independently owned parts stores jobber stores throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an oreilly store ozark operates its own separate marketing program to jobber stores 

 

approximately 191 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from ozark and participate in the parts city auto parts® program our proprietary jobber service program as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its parts city auto parts® membership through the display of the respective logo which is owned by ozark we provide advertising promotional assistance marketing and sales support to parts city auto parts® stores purchasing automotive products from ozark in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we offer assistance to parts city auto parts® jobber stores by making available computer software for business management and inventory control 

 

 

 

 

management structure 

 

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers in addition to the parts specialists and support staff required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 177 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores 

each district manager receives comprehensive training on a monthly basis focusing on management techniques new product announcements advanced automotive systems and our policies and procedures in turn the information presented at such meetings is covered by the district managers at bimonthly meetings with their store managers all assistant managers and managers in training are required to successfully complete a sixmonth managertraining program which includes classroom and field training as a prerequisite to becoming a store manager this program covers all facets of store operations as well as principles of successful management in addition all new or prospective managers attend a manager development program at the corporate headquarters in springfield mo which includes 40 hours of classroom training upon returning to the stores managers are given continuous field training throughout their management tenure 

we provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store team members through an incentive compensation program under our incentive compensation program base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon the achievement of sales and profitability goals in addition each our district and store managers participate in the company’s stock option program we believe that our incentive compensation program significantly increases the motivation and overall performance of our professional parts people and our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

most of our current senior management district managers and store managers were promoted to their positions from within the company our senior management team averages 16 years of experience with the company corporate managers average over 13 years of service and district managers have an average length of service with the company of over 10 years 

 

professional parts people 

 

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional installer customers each of our professional parts people is required to be technically proficient in the workings and application of automotive products due to the significant portion of our business represented by the professional installer in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from a professional parts person particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts we believe that the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression during a customers visit to our store and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

we screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts or repairs or an aptitude for automotive knowledge each person who becomes a team member first participates in an intensive twoday orientation program designed to introduce the team member to our culture and his or her job duties before being assigned specific job responsibilities the successful completion of extensive training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a parts specialist and thus able to work the parts counter at our stores all new parts specialists are required to successfully complete a sixmonth basic automotive systems training course and are then enrolled in a sixmonth advanced automotive systems course for certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which administers national exams for various automotive specialties and requires ase certified specialists to take recertification exams every five years 

each of our stores participates in our sales specialisttraining program under this program selected team members complete two days of extensive sales call training for business development after which these team members will spend one day per week calling on existing and new professional installer customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

customer service 

 

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional installer customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each oreilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle specifications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system market vehicle registration data and managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace 

 

 

 

 

pricing 

 

we believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to compete successfully product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based on a combination of competitive shops and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at discounts to the manufacturer suggested prices with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors 

 

competition 

 

we compete in both the diy and professional installer portions of the automotive aftermarket we compete primarily with 

 

  

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability price helpfulness of store personnel store layout and convenient and accessible store locations 

 

team members 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed 18546 fulltime team members and 5030 parttime team members of whom 18914 were employed at our stores 3372 were employed at our distribution centers and 1290 were employed at our corporate and regional offices none of our team members are subject to a collective bargaining agreement our 50 years of tradition is to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to instill in them our “live green” culture this focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industry leading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent 

 

service marks and trademarks 

 

we have registered the service marks oreilly automotive® parts payoff® parts city auto parts® oreilly auto parts® besttest® microgard® powertorque® and miles ahead® and the trademarks first call® superstart® brakebest® ultima® master pro® and omnispark® we believe that our business is not otherwise dependent upon any patent trademark service mark or copyright 

 

regulations 

 

although subject to various laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the environment compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date we cannot give any assurance however that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation

 item 1a 

risk factors   

tableend  

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there also may be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based on the information available to us that later may prove to be material you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forwardlooking statements 

 

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

 

both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the competition section of item 1 of this form 10k 

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

 

we believe that our ability to open additional stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2008 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the growth and expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10k 

 

risks associated with acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

 

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth to differ from our expectations for example 

 

  

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our sales 

 

all of our stores are located in the central midwest and southern united states in particular approximately 26 of our stores are located in texas therefore our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet or freezing rain has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers 

 

we depend on certain key personnel to successfully manage and grow our business 

 

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel including david oreilly ted wise and greg henslee our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals additionally the successful implementation and management of our growth and expansion strategies will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract such qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient reducing our sales and profitability for a further discussion of our management and personnel see the business section of item 1 and item 4a of this form 10k and our proxy statement on schedule 14a for the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders a portion of which is incorporated herein 

 

 

 

 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based on general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

 

all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amended subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock

competitive advantages 

  

proven ability to execute dual market strategy we have an established track record of serving both diy customers and professional installers we believe our ability to execute a dual market strategy is a competitive advantage which enables us to 

  

   

we have been committed to a dual market strategy for over 20 years in 2006 we derived approximately 52 of our sales from our diy customers and approximately 48 from our professional installer customers as a result of our historical success in executing our dual market strategy and our 264 fulltime sales representatives dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to the professional installer we believe we will increase the sales to professional installers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who derive a high concentration of their sales from the diy market 

  

superior customer service we seek to attract new diy and professional installer customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service the key elements of which include 

  

   

technically proficient professional parts people our highly proficient professional parts people provide us with a significant competitive advantage particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional parts people to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve the technically oriented professional installers with whom they interact on a daily basis such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our diy customers who appreciate the expert assistance provided by our professional parts people 

  

strategic distribution systems we believe that the geographic concentration of our store network in 25 contiguous states and the strategic locations of our 14 distribution centers enable us to maintain optimum inventory levels throughout our store network in addition our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to a distribution center providing for efficient inventory control and management our distribution system provides each of our stores with same day or overnight access to over 100000 skus many of which are hard to find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers we believe the timely availability of a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business 

  

experienced management team our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan including the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions we have experienced fourteen consecutive years of record revenues and earnings growth since becoming a public company in april 1993 we have a strong senior management team comprised of 87 professionals who average over 15 years of experience with oreilly in addition our 125 corporate managers average over 12 years of experience with us and our 156 district managers average over 9 years of experience with us

aggressively open new stores we intend to continue to aggressively open new stores in order to achieve greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 190 to 195 stores in 2007 and approximately 210 to 215 stores in 2008 a majority of the sites for our proposed 2007 store openings and several of the sites for our proposed 2008 store openings have been identified in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in areas such as management advertising and distribution 

  

we target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network see the store locations table on page 7 for a breakdown of net new stores by state while we have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets we believe that we have competed effectively and that we are well positioned to continue to compete 

  

  

  

effectively in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within these markets we also believe that because of our dual market strategy we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas within our regional markets which would not otherwise support a national or regional chain store selling primarily to one portion of the market or the other consequently we also expect to continue to open new stores in less densely populated market areas 

  

to date we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable store sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition candidates for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new stores either by i constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory or ii acquiring an independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such store store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution system in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution costs other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities other competing auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve further economies of scale 

  

profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy to achieve improved sales and profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing is essential in the competitive environment of the automotive aftermarket business it is customer satisfaction whether of the diy consumer or professional installer resulting from superior customer service which generates increased sales and profitability 

  

selectively pursue strategic acquisitions although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented we believe the ability of national and regional specialty retail chains such as ourselves to operate more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation thus we intend to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive products retailer 

  

continually enhance store design and location our current prototype store design features enhancements such as greater square footage higher ceilings more convenient interior store layouts improved instore signage brighter lighting increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional installers each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service we continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance we believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network which is strategically located to best serve our customers 

  

  

  

  

products and purchasing 

  

our stores offer diy and professional installer customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles vans and trucks we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized welladvertised name brand products such as ac delco moog murray wagner gates rubber federal mogul monroe prestone quaker state pennzoil castrol valvoline stp bwd cardone wix armor all and turtle wax in addition to name brand products our stores carry a wide variety of highquality private label products under our oreilly auto parts® superstart® brakebest® ultima® master pro® and omnispark® proprietary name brands because most of our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers in accordance with our specifications we believe that the private label products are generally of equal or in some cases better quality than comparable name brand products a characteristic which is important to our diy customers we further believe that our private label products are packaged attractively to promote customer interest and are generally priced below comparable name brand products carried in our stores 

  

we purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 400 vendors the five largest of which accounted for approximately 30 of our total purchases in 2006 our largest vendor in 2006 accounted for approximately 13 of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors accounted for 35 of such purchases each we have no longterm contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors during 2006 we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain of our vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases including payonscan arrangements as a whole we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good 

  

inflation and seasonality 

  

we have been successful in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying as a result we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 

  

to some extent our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters 

  

  

  

  

  

store network 

  

store locations as a result of our dual market strategy we are able to profitably operate in both large densely populated markets and small less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national or regional chain selling primarily to just one portion of the automotive aftermarket the following table sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores 

  

  

   

our stores on average carry approximately 21000 skus and average approximately 6700 total square feet in size at december 31 2006 we had a total of approximately 110 million square feet in our 1640 stores our stores are served primarily by the nearest distribution center but they also have access to the broader selection of inventory available at one of our 94 master inventory stores which on average carry approximately 35000 skus and average approximately 9000 square feet in size in addition to serving diy and professional installer customers in their markets master inventory stores also provide our other stores within their area access to a greater selection of skus on a sameday basis 

  

we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity consequently most of our stores are freestanding buildings situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking and easy customer access 

  

store layout we utilize a computerassisted planogrammed store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent merchandise presentation however each store’s inventory assortment is customized to meet the specific needs of a particular market area merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access maximum selling space and to prominently display highturnover products and accessories to customers to ensure the best customer experience possible we have implemented bilingual instore signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area aisle displays are used to feature highdemand or seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials 

  

  

  

  

  

store automation to enhance store level operations and customer service we use ibm as400 computer systems in all of our stores these systems are linked with the ibm as400 computers located in each of our distribution centers our pointofsale terminals provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to display parts and pricing information by make model and year of vehicle and use bar code scanning technology to price our merchandise this system speeds transaction times reduces the customer’s checkout time and provides enhanced customer service moreover our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management strategic planning inventory control and distribution efficiency 

  

new store site selection in selecting sites for new stores we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management advertising and distribution other key factors we consider in the site selection process include 

  

   

when entering new more densely populated markets we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve further economies of scale after opening this initial cluster of new stores we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas this strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market 

  

distribution system 

  

we currently operate 14 distribution centers comprised of approximately 45 million square feet see the “properties” table in item 2 of this form 10k for a detailed listing of distribution center square footages our distribution centers are equipped with highly automated conveyor systems which expedite the movement of our products to loading areas for shipment to individual stores on a nightly basis the distribution centers utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores in addition to the bar code system employed in our stores each of our stores is connected through secured data transmission technology to our distribution centers and corporate headquarters 

  

we believe that our distribution system assists us in lowering our inventorycarrying costs improving our store instock positions and controlling and managing our inventory moreover we believe that our expanding network of distribution centers allows us to more efficiently service existing stores as well as new stores planned to open in contiguous market areas our distribution center expansion strategy also complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each distribution center as part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2007 we plan to 

  

   

marketing 

  

marketing to the diy customer we aggressively promote sales to diy customers through an extensive advertising program which includes direct mail newspaper radio and television advertising in selected markets we believe that our advertising and promotional activities have resulted in significant name recognition in each of our market areas newspaper and radio advertisements are generally directed towards specific product and price promotions frequently in connection with specific sale events or promotions to promote sales to car enthusiasts who we believe on an individual basis spend more on automotive products than the general public we sponsored 11 nationally televised races and over 1400 motorsports races and car shows in 25 states including 3 nascar craftsmen truck series races 2 nascar busch series races 6 national hotrod racing association races as well as the o’reilly chili bowl o’reilly auto parts is the “official auto parts store” of texas motor speedway kansas speedway bristol motor 

  

  

  

speedway houston raceway park texas motorplex memphis motorsports park heartland park gateway international atlanta motor speedway atlanta dragway o’reilly raceway park at indianapolis and talladega speedway 

  

since 2003 we have aggressively sought to market the o’reilly name in the national collegiate athletic association our first initiative was to partner with texas tech university through a variety of programs including sponsoring a television show featuring bobby knight the coach of the men’s basketball team at texas tech university placing the o’reilly logo on the home basketball court and coach knight’s sweater and advertising on the seatbacks and scoring table banners this has led to additional opportunities with approximately 63 colleges and 3 conferences in our current markets in 2006 we signed an agreement with steve alford head coach of the iowa hawkeyes for radio and television coverage we have found that the more progressive marketing concepts utilized in the diy portion of our business have also resulted in increased sales to our professional installer customers 

  

marketing to the professional installer we have 264 fulltime oreilly sales representatives strategically located in the more densely populated market areas that we serve and each is dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to the professional installer our first call program includes a dedicated sales force sales and promotions directed to the professional installer and same day or overnight delivery service from the distribution center to the professional customer moreover each district manager and store manager throughout our store network calls upon existing and potential new professional installer customers on a regular basis our first call marketing strategy with respect to professional installers emphasizes our ability to offer  

  

   

marketing to the independently owned parts store  along with the operation of the distribution centers and the distribution of automotive products to our stores ozark automotive distributors inc our whollyowned subsidiary “ozark” also sells automotive products to independently owned parts stores jobber stores throughout our trade areas these jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an oreilly store ozark operates its own separate marketing program to jobber stores 

  

of the approximately 211 jobber stores currently purchasing automotive products from ozark 144 participate in the auto value® program and 67 participate in the bumper to bumper® program through ozark as a participant in these programs a jobber store which meets certain minimum financial and operational standards is permitted to indicate its auto value® or bumper to bumper® membership through the display of the respective logo which is owned by the alliance inc a nonprofit buying group consisting of approximately 2800 member stores as of december 31 2006 including oreilly engaged in the distribution or sale of automotive products additionally we provide advertising and promotional assistance to auto value® and bumper to bumper® stores purchasing automotive products from ozark as well as marketing and sales support in return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from ozark we offer assistance to an auto value® or bumper to bumper® jobber store by making available computer software for business management and inventory control 

  

  

  

  

management structure 

  

each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and an assistant manager in addition to the parts specialists and support staff required to meet the specific needs of each store each of our 156 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 11 stores 

  

each district manager receives comprehensive training on a monthly basis focusing on management techniques new product announcements advanced automotive systems and our policies and procedures in turn the information covered at such meetings is covered by the district managers at bimonthly meetings with their store managers all assistant managers and manager trainees are required to successfully complete a sixmonth managertraining program which includes classroom and field training as a prerequisite to becoming a store manager this program covers all facets of store operations as well as principles of successful management in addition all new or prospective managers attend a manager development program at the corporate office headquarters which includes 40 hours of classroom training upon returning to the stores managers are given continuous field training throughout their management experience 

  

we provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store team members through an incentive compensation program under our incentive compensation program base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon the achievement of sales and profitability goals we believe that our incentive compensation program significantly increases the motivation and overall performance of our professional parts people and our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel 

  

most of our current senior management district managers and store managers were promoted to their positions from within the company our senior management team averages 15 years of experience with the company corporate managers average over 12 years of service and district managers have an average length of service with the company of over 9 years 

  

professional parts people 

  

we believe our highly trained team of professional parts people is essential in providing superior customer service to both diy and professional installer customers each of our professional parts people is required to be technically proficient in the workings and application of automotive products due to the significant portion of our business represented by the professional installer in addition we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance from a salesperson particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts we believe that the ability of our professional parts people to provide such assistance to the diy customer creates a favorable impression during a customers visit to our store and is a significant factor in generating repeat diy business 

  

we screen prospective employees whom we refer to as team members to identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts or repairs or an aptitude for automotive knowledge each person who becomes a team member first participates in an intensive twoday orientation program designed to introduce the team member to our culture and his or her job duties before being assigned specific job responsibilities the successful completion of extensive training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a parts specialist and thus able to work at the parts counter at our stores all new counter people are required to successfully complete a sixmonth basic automotive systems training course and are then enrolled in a sixmonth advanced automotive systems course for certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which administers national exams for various automotive specialties and requires ase certified specialists to take recertification exams every five years 

  

each of our stores participates in our sales specialisttraining program under this program selected team members complete two days of extensive sales call training for business development after which these team members will spend one day per week calling on existing and new professional installer customers additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development 

  

  

  

  

  

customer service 

  

we seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant instore experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional installer customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide in a timely fashion the specific automotive products requested accordingly each oreilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle specifications we continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our computerized inventory control system market vehicle registration data and managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace 

  

pricing 

  

we believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential within product categories to compete successfully product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store most automotive products that we sell are priced based on a combination of competitive shops and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at discounts to the manufacturer suggested prices with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing consistent with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any instock product of the same or comparable quality offered by any of our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete in both the diy and professional installer portions of the automotive aftermarket we compete primarily with 

  

   

we compete on the basis of customer service which includes merchandise selection and availability price helpfulness of store personnel and store layout and location 

  

  

  

  

team members 

  

as of december 31 2006 we employed 17153 fulltime team members and 4767 parttime team members of whom 17494 were employed at our stores 3188 were employed at our distribution centers and 1238 were employed at our corporate and regional offices none of our team members are subject to a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent and we strive to promote good relations with our team members through various programs 

  

servicemarks and trademarks 

  

we have registered the servicemarks oreilly automotive® oreilly auto parts® and parts payoff® and the trademarks superstart® brakebest® omnispark® first call® ultima® microgard® and master pro® further we are licensed to use the registered trademarks and servicemarks auto value® parts master® and bumper to bumper® owned by the alliance inc in connection with our marketing programs we believe that our business is not otherwise dependent upon any patent trademark servicemark or copyright 

  

regulations 

  

although subject to various laws and governmental regulations relating to our business including those related to the environment we do not believe that compliance with such laws and regulations has a material adverse effect on our operations further we are unaware of any failure to comply with any such laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations we can not give any assurance however that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation

risk factors   

tableend   

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there also may be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based on the information available to us that later may prove to be material you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forwardlooking statements 

  

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

  

both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the competition section of item 1 of this form 10k 

  

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

  

we believe that our ability to open additional stores at an accelerated rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2007 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the growth and expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10k 

  

risks associated with acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

  

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth to differ from our expectations for example 

  

   

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our sales 

  

all of our stores are located in the central midwest and southern united states in particular approximately 26 of our stores are located in texas therefore our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of these regions unusually inclement weather such as significant rain snow sleet or freezing rain has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores and reduced our sales particularly to diy customers 

  

we depend on certain key personnel to successfully manage and grow our business 

  

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel including david oreilly ted wise and greg henslee our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals additionally the successful implementation and management of our growth and expansion strategies will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract such qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient reducing our sales and profitability for a further discussion of our 

  

  

  

management and personnel see the business section of item 1 and item 4a of this form 10k and our proxy statement on schedule 14a for the 2007 annual meeting of shareholders a portion of which is incorporated herein 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

  

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based on general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

  

all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amended subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock

 item 1a 

risk factors   

tableend   

our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently regard as immaterial based on the information available to us that later may prove to be material you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition actual results therefore may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forwardlooking statements 

  

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive 

  

both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly competitive particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive for a list of our principal competitors see the competition section of item 1 of this form 10k 

  

we cannot assure future growth will be achieved 

  

we believe that our ability to open additional stores at an accelerated rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather conditions zoning and other issues related to new store site development the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2006 and beyond will be achieved failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock for a discussion of our growth strategies see the growth and expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10k 

  

risks associated with acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies 

  

we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth to differ from our expectations for example 

  

   

we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our sales 

  

all of our stores are located in the central midwest and southern united states in particular approximately 27 of our stores are located in texas therefore our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of these regions unusually inclement weather has historically reduced our sales particularly to diy customers 

  

we depend on certain key and other personnel to successfully manage and grow our business 

  

our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel including david oreilly ted wise greg henslee and jim batten our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals additionally the successful implementation and management of our growth and expansion strategies will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract such qualified personnel which could cause us to be less efficient and reduce our sales for a further discussion of our management and personnel see the business section of item 1 and item 4a of this form 10k and our proxy statement on schedule 14a for the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders a portion of which is incorporated herein 

  

  

  

  

if the oreilly family acts together they will be a significant factor in a shareholder vote 

  

as of the date of this form 10k the oreilly family beneficially owns approximately 7 or 8020205 shares of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result the oreilly family if they act together represents one of the largest known blocks of our shares and may continue to be a significant factor in any matter voted on by our shareholders including the election of our directors and any merger sale of assets or other change in control 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

  

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based on general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price 

  

all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933 as amended subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule we cannot predict the effect if any that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock

competitive advantages

     proven  ability to execute  dual market  strategy  we have an  established
track record of serving  both diy  customers  and  professional  installers  we
believe  our  ability  to  execute  a  dual  market  strategy  is a  competitive
advantage which enables us to

o    target a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts

o    capitalize on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure

o    profitably  operate  both in  large  markets  and  less  densely  populated
     geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and

o    enhance  service  levels  offered to our diy  customers by offering a broad
     selection of stock  keeping units skus and  extensive  product  knowledge
     required by professional installers

     we have been  committed to a dual market  strategy  for over 20 years  for
2004 we derived  approximately  52 of our product sales from our diy customers
and approximately 48 from our professional installer customers  as a result of
our  historical  success  in  executing  our dual  market  strategy  and our 172
fulltime sales representatives  dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to
the  professional   installer   we  believe  we  will  increase  the  sales  to
professional  installers  and  have a  competitive  advantage  over  our  retail
competitors   who  have  only  recently   entered  and  begun  focusing  on  the
professional installer market

     superior  customer  service  we seek to attract  new diy and  professional
installer  customers  and to retain  existing  customers  by  offering  superior
customer service the key elements of which include

o    superior instore service through highlymotivated  technically proficient
     store personnel  professional  parts people using advanced  pointofsale
     systems

o    an extensive selection of products

o    attractive stores in convenient locations and

o    competitive pricing with a low price guarantee

     technically  proficient  professional  parts people  our highly proficient
professional parts people provide us with a significant  competitive  advantage
particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional
parts people to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve
the  technicallyoriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis  such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our diy customers  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our professional parts people

     strategic   distribution   systems   we   believe   that  the   geographic
concentration  of our store  network in nineteen  contiguous  states  alabama
arkansas   florida  georgia   illinois   indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky
louisiana  mississippi  missouri  nebraska  north carolina  oklahoma south
carolina  tennessee texas and virginia and the strategic locations of our ten
distribution  centers enable us to maintain optimum  inventory levels throughout
our store  network  in addition  our  inventory  management  and  distribution
systems  electronically  link  each  of our  stores  to a  distribution  center
providing for  efficient  inventory  control and  management  our  distribution
system  provides  each of our stores with same day or  overnight  access to over
100000  skus  many of which are hard to find  items not  typically  stocked by
other parts retailers  we believe the availability of a broad range of products
is a key  competitive  advantage in satisfying  customer  demand and  generating
repeat business

     experienced management team our management team has a demonstrated ability
to  successfully  execute our business plan  including the  identification  and
integration of strategic  acquisitions  we have experienced  twelve consecutive
years of record  revenues and earnings growth since becoming a public company in
april  1993  we  have  a  strong  senior   management   team  comprised  of  60
professionals  who  average  over 16  years  of  experience  with  oreilly  in
addition  our 90 corporate managers average over 13 years of experience with us
and our 117 district managers average over 9 years of experience with us

growth and expansion strategies

     aggressively  open new stores  we intend to continue to aggressively  open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 160 stores in
2005 and  approximately  170180 stores in 2006 a majority of the sites for our
proposed  2005 store  openings  and several of the sites for our  proposed  2006
store openings have been identified  in selecting sites for new stores we seek
to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order
to achieve  economies  of scale in areas  such as  management  advertising  and
distribution

     we target  both small  population  less than  100000  and large  markets
population greater than 100000 for expansion of our store network of the 140
net new stores added in 2004  30 are located in alabama  2 in arkansas  3 in
florida 14 in georgia 13 in illinois 2 in indiana 1 in iowa 1 in kansas 14
in kentucky  6 in  louisiana  15 in  mississippi  10 in missouri  6 in north
carolina  1 in oklahoma  1 in south carolina  15 in tennessee and 6 in texas
while we have faced and expect to continue to face more aggressive competition
in the  more  densely  populated  markets  we  believe  that we  have  competed
effectively and that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively
in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within
these markets we also believe that because of our dual market strategy  we are
better  able to  operate  stores in less  densely  populated  areas  within  our
regional market  which would not otherwise support a national or regional chain
store selling to one portion of the market or the other consequently we expect
to continue to open new stores in less densely populated market areas

     to date  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new
stores either by i constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and
stocking  the new store  with  fixtures  and  inventory  or ii  acquiring  an
independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially
all of the inventory  and other assets other than realty of such store  store
sites are  strategically  located  in  clusters  within  geographic  areas  that
complement  our  distribution  system in order to achieve  economies of scale in
management advertising and distribution costs other key factors we consider in
the site selection process include population  density and growth patterns  age
and per capita income  vehicle traffic counts  the number and type of existing
automotive  repair  facilities  other  competing  auto parts stores  and other
competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such
competitors  when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale

     same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy   to  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business   it  is  customer  satisfaction  whether  of  the  diy  consumer  or
professional installer resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability

     selectively   pursue  strategic   acquisitions   although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains such as oreilly to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation  thus  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer

     continually enhance store design and location  our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage  higher ceilings
more convenient  interior store layouts  brighter  lighting  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service  we continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design  we  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers

brand products  our stores carry a wide variety of  highquality  private label
products under our oreilly auto parts  superstart  brakebest  ultima master
pro and  omnispark  proprietary  name brands  because most of our private label
products are produced by nationally recognized  manufacturers in accordance with
our specifications  we believe that the private label products are generally of
equal or in some cases  better quality than comparable name brand products  a
characteristic which is important to our professional  installer  clientele  we
further  believe that the private label  products are packaged  attractively  to
promote  customer  interest and are generally priced below comparable name brand
products carried in our stores

     we purchase  automotive  products from approximately 530 vendors  the five
largest of which accounted for approximately 37 of our total purchases in 2004
our  largest  vendor  in  2004  accounted  for  approximately  18 of our  total
purchases  and  the  next  four  largest  vendors  accounted  for 4  7 of such
purchases each we have no longterm  contractual  purchase commitments with any
of our vendors  nor have we  experienced  difficulty in obtaining  satisfactory
alternative  sources of supply for automotive parts we believe that alternative
supply sources exist at  substantially  similar  costs  for  substantially  all
automotive  products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment
and  seasonal  purchasing  discounts  offered  by our  vendors  and to  utilize
extended  dating terms available from vendors due to volume  purchasing  during
2004  we entered into various  programs  and  arrangements  with certain of our
vendors  that  provide  for  extended  dating and  payment  terms for  inventory
purchases  including  payonscan  arrangements  we consider our relationships
with our suppliers to be good

inflation and seasonality

     we have  been  successful  in many  cases  in  reducing  the  effects  of
merchandise  cost increases  principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive
programs  economies of scale  resulting from increased  volume of purchases and
selective  forward  buying  as a result  we do not believe our operations have
been materially affected by inflation

     our business is seasonal to some extent primarily as a result of the impact
of weather  conditions on store sales store sales and profits have historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  april through  september of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters

store network

     store locations  as a result of our dual market  strategy  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas that would not otherwise  support a national or regional  chain
selling to just one portion of the automotive  aftermarket  the following table

                           total                        1249


     our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately   23000  skus  and  average
approximately  6700 total square feet in size  at december 31 2004  we had a
total of approximately  83 million square feet in our 1249 stores  our stores
are served primarily by the nearest distribution center but also have access to
the broader  selection of inventory  available at one of our 85 master inventory
stores   which  on  average  carry   approximately   36000  skus  and  average
approximately 8800 square feet in size master inventory stores in addition to
serving diy and professional  installer customers in their markets also provide
our other stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection of skus on a
sameday basis

     we believe that our stores are destination  stores generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity  consequently  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access

     store  layout  we  utilize a  computerassisted  planogrammed  store
layout  system to provide a uniform  and  consistent  merchandise  presentation
however  some  variation  occurs  in  order  to meet  the  specific  needs of a
particular market area  merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access
and maximum selling space keeping highturnover products and accessories within
view of the customer  aisle displays are generally used to feature  highdemand
or seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials

     store  automation  to enhance store level operations and customer service
we use ibm as400  computer  systems in all of our  stores  these  systems  are
linked  with  the ibm  as400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers our pointofsale  terminals provide immediate access to our electronic
catalog to display  parts and  pricing  information  by make  model and year of
vehicle and use bar code  scanning  technology  to price our  merchandise  this
system speeds  transaction  times  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service   moreover   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management  strategic  planning  inventory
control and distribution efficiency

     new store site  selection  in selecting  sites for new stores  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management  advertising and  distribution  other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include

o    population density and growth patterns

o    age and per capita income

o    vehicle traffic counts

o    the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and

o    the  number  of  auto  parts   stores  and  other   competitors   within  a
     predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors

     when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally  seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale  after  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas this strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market

     adjacent to the springfield  missouri  distribution  center  we operate a
36000 square foot bulk merchandise  warehouse used for the distribution of bulk
products such as motor oil  antifreeze  batteries  lubricants  and other fast
moving  bulk  products  and a 22000  square  foot  returned  goods  processing
facility that is included in the above square footage we also operate a 17500
square  foot bulk  warehouse  in  mcallen  texas that  serves  the  surrounding
distribution centers with bulk products

     our  distribution  centers  are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis  the  distribution  centers
utilize  computerassisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores  in  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores we have established a  satellitebased  data interchange
system among those stores in which  highspeed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available  the distribution  center which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters

     we  believe  that  our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventorycarrying   costs   improving  our  store  instock   positions   and
controlling and managing our inventory  moreover we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas
our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center  as part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2005 we plan to

     including conveyor systems forklifts and racking

marketing

     marketing  to the  diy  customer  we  aggressively  promote  sales  to diy
customers through an extensive advertising program  which includes direct mail
newspaper radio and television advertising in selected markets we believe that
our  advertising and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant  name
recognition in each of our market areas  newspaper and radio advertisements are
generally directed towards specific product and price promotions  frequently in
connection  with  specific sale events and  promotions  to promote sales to car
enthusiasts  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally we sponsor 16 nationally televised races and
over 288  motorsports  races and car shows at over 200  facilities in 18 states
including 3 nascar craftsmen truck series races 2 nascar busch series races in
dallas  5 national  hotrod racing  association  races  as well as the oreilly
chili bowl  oreilly  auto parts is the  official  auto parts  store of texas
motor speedway kansas speedway  bristol motor speedway  houston raceway park
texas  motorplex   memphis  motorsports  park  heartland  park  and  talladega
speedway

     beginning in 2003  we started  work on branding  the oreilly  name in the
national  collegiate  athletic  association  also known as the ncaa  our first
initiative  was to  partner  with  texas  tech  university  through a variety of
programs  including  sponsoring of a television show featuring bobby knight the
coach  of the  mens  basketball  team at texas  tech  university  placing  the
oreilly  logo on the home  basketball  court and coach  knights  sweater  and
advertising  on the backs of seats and banners for the scoring  table  this has
lead  to  additional   opportunities   with  approximately  24  colleges  and  3
conferences  in our  current  markets  we have found that the more  progressive
marketing  concepts  utilized  in the diy  portion of our  business  can also be
applied to increase sales to our professional installer customers

     marketing  to the  professional  installer  we  have  over  172  fulltime
oreilly  sales  representatives  strategically  located  in  the  more  densely
populated  market areas that we serve  and each is dedicated  solely to calling
upon and selling to the professional installer our first call program which is
our commitment to the professional  customer  includes a dedicated sales force
sales and  promotions  directed  to the  professional  installer  and  overnight
delivery  service from the  distribution  center to the  professional  customer
moreover  each district manager and store manager  throughout our store network
calls upon  existing and  potential new  professional  installer  customers on a
regular basis our first call marketing  strategy  with respect to professional
installers emphasizes our ability to offer

o    prompt delivery using small trucks or vans operated by virtually all of our
     stores

o    a separate  counter in all of our stores  dedicated  exclusively to serving
     professional installers

o    trade credit for qualified professional installers

o    broad inventory of merchandise and competitive pricing

o    a  professional  installer  computer  system that connects  directly to our
     inventory system and

o    seminars concerning topics of interest to professional installers  such as
     technical updates safety and general business management

     marketing to the independently  owned parts store along with the operation
of the distribution  centers and the distribution of automotive  products to the
oreilly  stores  ozark  automotive  distributors   inc  ozark  also  sells
automotive  products to independently owned parts stores whose retail stores are
generally  located in areas not serviced by an oreilly  store  we generally do
not compete with any independently owned parts store to which we sell automotive
products   but  have  on  occasion   acquired  the  business   assets  of  an
independently  owned  parts  store  supplied by ozark  ozark  operates  its own

essential in providing  superior service both to diy and professional  installer
customers  each of our professional  parts people is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer
in addition  we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts
we believe  that the ability of our  professional  parts  people to provide such
assistance  to  the  diy  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customers visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
diy business

customer service

     we seek to provide our customers  with an efficient  and pleasant  instore
experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide

accordingly  each  oreilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications   we
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace

categories  in order to  compete  successfully  product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store  most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing  consistent
with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price

resources  in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall

we cannot assure future growth

     we believe  that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future  failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock  our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather
conditions  zoning and other issues related to new store site development  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions  we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2005 and beyond will be
achieved  for a  discussion  of our growth  strategies  see the  growth  and
expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10k

acquisitions may not lead to expected growth

     we expect to  continue  to make  acquisitions  as an  element of our growth
strategy  acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth
to differ from our expectations for example

o    we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition  candidates
     or to  acquire  additional  companies  at  favorable  prices  or  on  other
     favorable terms

o    our managements attention may be distracted

o    we may fail to retain key acquired personnel

o    we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems and

o    we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations accounting and
     billing  functions  for  example  of  businesses  we  acquire  to realize
     economic operational and other benefits


sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions

     all of our stores are located in the central and southern united states in
particular approximately 31 of our stores are located in texas therefore our
business is sensitive to the economic and weather  conditions of these  regions
unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales particularly to diy
customers

dependence upon key and other personnel

     our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain  key
personnel  including david oreilly ted wise greg henslee and jim batten our
business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the
unexpected  loss  of  the  services  of  one  or  more  of  these   individuals
additionally  our  successful  implementation  and management of our growth and
expansion  strategies  will  depend on our  ability to  continue  to attract and
retain qualified  personnel  we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue
to attract  such  personnel  for a further  discussion  of our  management  and
personnel  see the business section of item 1 and item 4a of this form 10k
and our  proxy  statement  on  schedule  14a  for the  2005  annual  meeting  of
shareholders a portion of which is incorporated herein

significant voting block is held by the oreilly family

     as of the date of this form 10k  the oreilly  family  beneficially  owns
approximately  10 or 5614687 number of shares of the outstanding  shares of
our  common  stock  as a  result  the  oreilly  family  if they  act and act
togehter  represents  one of the  largest  known  blocks of our  shares and may
continue to be a significant  factor in any matter voted on by our shareholders
including the election of our directors and any merger  sale of assets or other
change in control

possible volatility of our stock price

     the stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock  may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions  the
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts expectations  failure to meet such expectations even slightly could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock  in addition
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies  in the past following periods of volatility in
the market price of a companys  securities  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company  if similar  litigation were
instituted  against us it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our managements attention and resources  which could have an adverse effect on
our business

shares eligible for future sale

     all of the shares of common stock  currently  held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act
of 1933 as amended  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule we cannot predict the effect  if any that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time  sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock  or the perception  that such sales might occur  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock

competitive advantages

     proven  ability to execute  dual market  strategy  we have an  established
track record of serving  both diy  customers  and  professional  installers  we
believe  our  ability  to  execute  a  dual  market  strategy  is a  competitive
advantage which enables us to

o    target a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts

o    capitalize on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure

o    profitably  operate  both in  large  markets  and  less  densely  populated
     geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and

o    enhance  service  levels  offered to our diy  customers by offering a broad
     selection of stock  keeping units skus and  extensive  product  knowledge
     required by professional installers

     we have been  committed to a dual market  strategy  for over 20 years  for
2003 we derived  approximately  53 of our product sales from our diy customers
and approximately 47 from our professional installer customers  as a result of
our  historical  success  in  executing  our dual  market  strategy  and our 173
fulltime sales representatives  dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to
the  professional   installer   we  believe  we  will  increase  the  sales  to
professional  installers  and  have a  competitive  advantage  over  our  retail
competitors   who  have  only  recently   entered  and  begun  focusing  on  the
professional installer market

     superior  customer  service  we seek to attract  new diy and  professional
installer  customers  and to retain  existing  customers  by  offering  superior
customer service the key elements of which include

o    superior instore service through highlymotivated  technically proficient
     store personnel  professional  parts people using advanced  pointofsale
     systems

o    an extensive selection of products

o    attractive stores in convenient locations and

o    competitive pricing with a low price guarantee

     technically  proficient  professional  parts people  our highly proficient
professional parts people provide us with a significant  competitive  advantage
particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional
parts people to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve
the  technicallyoriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis  such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our diy customers  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our professional parts people

     strategic   distribution   systems   we   believe   that  the   geographic
concentration  of our store  network in eighteen  contiguous  states  alabama
arkansas   florida  georgia   illinois   indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky
louisiana mississippi missouri nebraska north carolina oklahoma tennessee
texas and virginia and the strategic locations of our ten distribution  centers
enable us to maintain optimum inventory levels throughout our store network  in
addition  our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link
each of our stores to a distribution  center  providing for efficient inventory
control and management our distribution system provides each of our stores with
same day or overnight  access to  approximately  100000 skus many of which are
hard to find items not typically  stocked by other parts  retailers  we believe
the availability of a broad range of products is a key competitive  advantage in
satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business

     experienced management team our management team has a demonstrated ability
to  successfully  execute our business plan  including the  identification  and
integration of strategic  acquisitions  we have experienced  eleven consecutive
years of record  revenues and earnings growth since becoming a public company in
april  1993  we  have  a  strong  senior   management   team  comprised  of  57
professionals who average 16 years of experience with oreilly in addition our
106 district managers average over 9 years of experience with us

growth and expansion strategies

     aggressively  open new stores  we intend to continue to aggressively  open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 140 stores in
2004 and  approximately  150  stores in 2005  a  majority  of the sites for our
proposed  2004 store  openings  and several of the sites for our  proposed  2005
store openings have been identified  in selecting sites for new stores we seek
to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order
to achieve  economies  of scale in areas  such as  management  advertising  and
distribution

     we target  both small  population  less than  100000  and large  markets
population greater than 100000 for expansion of our store network of the 128
net new stores added in 2003  25 are located in alabama  5 in arkansas  3 in
florida 9 in illinois  1 in indiana 1 in iowa 2 in kansas 10 in kentucky 3
in louisiana  16 in mississippi  2 in missouri  15 in north  carolina  17 in
tennessee  18 in texas and 1 in  virginia  while we have faced  and expect to
continue to face  more  aggressive  competition  in the more densely  populated
markets  we believe  that we have  competed  effectively  and that we are well
positioned to continue to compete  effectively  in such markets and achieve our
goal of continued sales and profit growth within these markets  we also believe
that because of our dual market  strategy  we are better able to operate stores
in less densely  populated  areas within our  regional  market  which would not
otherwise  support a national or regional  chain store selling to one portion of
the market or the other consequently  we expect to continue to open new stores
in less densely populated market areas

     to date  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new
stores either by i constructing a new store at a site we purchase or lease and
stocking  the new store  with  fixtures  and  inventory  or ii  acquiring  an
independently owned auto parts store typically by the purchase of substantially
all of the inventory  and other assets other than realty of such store  store
sites are  strategically  located  in  clusters  within  geographic  areas  that
complement  our  distribution  system in order to achieve  economies of scale in
management advertising and distribution costs other key factors we consider in
the site selection process include population  density and growth patterns  age
and per capita income  vehicle traffic counts  the number and type of existing
automotive  repair  facilities  other  competing  auto parts stores  and other
competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such
competitors  when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale

     same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy   to  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business   it  is  customer  satisfaction  whether  of  the  diy  consumer  or
professional installer resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability

                                       4

page
     selectively   pursue  strategic   acquisitions   although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains such as oreilly to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation  thus  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer

     continually enhance store design and location  our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage  higher ceilings
more convenient  interior store layouts  brighter  lighting  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service  we continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design  we  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers

products and purchasing

     our stores offer diy and professional  installer customers a wide selection
of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported  automobiles
vans  and  trucks  we do not  sell  tires  or  perform  automotive  repairs  or
installations  our  merchandise  generally  consists of nationally  recognized
welladvertised  name brand products such as ac delco  moog  murray  wagner
gates rubber federal mogul monroe prestone quaker state pennzoil  castrol
valvoline stp bwd cardone wix armor all and turtle wax in addition to name
brand products  our stores carry a wide variety of  highquality  private label
products under our oreilly auto parts  superstart  brakebest  ultima master
pro and  omnispark  proprietary  name brands  because most of our private label
products are produced by nationally recognized  manufacturers in accordance with
our specifications  we believe that the private label products are generally of
equal or in some cases  better quality than comparable name brand products  a
characteristic which is important to our professional  installer  clientele  we
further  believe that the private label  products are packaged  attractively  to
promote  customer  interest and are generally priced below comparable name brand
products carried in our stores

     we purchase  automotive  products from approximately 400 vendors  the five
largest of which accounted for approximately 38 of our total purchases in 2003
our  largest  vendor  in  2003  accounted  for  approximately  15 of our  total
purchases  and the  next  four  largest  vendors  accounted  for  411  of such
purchases each we have no longterm  contractual  purchase commitments with any
of our vendors  nor have we  experienced  difficulty in obtaining  satisfactory
alternative  sources of supply for automotive parts we believe that alternative
supply sources exist at  substantially  similar  costs  for  substantially  all
automotive  products that we sell it is our policy to take advantage of payment
and  seasonal  purchasing  discounts  offered  by our  vendors  and to  utilize
extended  dating terms available from vendors due to volume  purchasing  during
2003  we entered into various  programs  and  arrangements  with certain of our
vendors  that  provide  for  extended  dating and  payment  terms for  inventory
purchases  including  payonscan  arrangements  we consider our relationships
with our suppliers to be good

inflation and seasonality

     we have  been  successful  in many  cases  in  reducing  the  effects  of
merchandise  cost increases  principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive
programs  economies of scale  resulting from increased  volume of purchases and
selective  forward  buying  as a result  we do not believe our operations have
been materially affected by inflation

     our business is seasonal to some extent primarily as a result of the impact
of weather  conditions on store sales store sales and profits have historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  april through  september of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters

     store locations  as a result of our dual market  strategy  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas that would not otherwise  support a national or regional  chain

             total                      1109



     our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately   22000  skus  and  average
approximately  6600 total square feet in size  at december 31 2003  we had a
total of approximately  73 million square feet in our 1109 stores  our stores
are served primarily by the nearest distribution center but also have access to
the broader  selection of inventory  available at one of our 61 master inventory
stores   which  on  average  carry   approximately   36000  skus  and  average
approximately 8800 square feet in size master inventory stores in addition to
serving diy and professional installer customers in their markets also provides
our other stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection of skus on a
sameday basis

     we believe that our stores are  destination  stores  generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity  consequently  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access

     store layout we utilize a computerassisted  planogrammed store layout
system to provide a uniform and consistent  merchandise  presentation  however
some variation occurs in order to meet the specific needs of a particular market
area  merchandise  is  arranged  to provide  easy  customer  access and maximum
selling space keeping highturnover products and accessories within view of the
customer  aisle displays are generally used to feature  highdemand or seasonal
merchandise new items and advertised specials

     store  automation  to enhance store level operations and customer service
we use ibm as400  computer  systems in all of our  stores  these  systems  are
linked  with  the ibm  as400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers our pointofsale  terminals provide immediate access to our electronic
catalog to display  parts and  pricing  information  by make  model and year of
vehicle and use bar code  scanning  technology  to price our  merchandise  this
system speeds  transaction  times  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service   moreover   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management  strategic  planning  inventory
control and distribution efficiency

     new store site  selection  in selecting  sites for new stores  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management  advertising and  distribution  other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include

o    population density and growth patterns

o    age and per capita income

o    vehicle traffic counts

o    the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and

o    the  number  of  auto  parts   stores  and  other   competitors   within  a
     predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors

     when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally  seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale  after  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas this strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market

     in addition adjacent to the springfield  missouri distribution center we
operate  a  36000  square  foot  bulk   merchandise   warehouse  used  for  the
distribution  of  bulk  products  such  as  motor  oil  antifreeze  batteries
lubricants  and other  fast  moving  bulk  products  and a 20000  square  foot
returned goods  processing  facility  we also operate a 31000 square foot bulk
warehouse in mcallen  texas that serves the  surrounding  distribution  centers
with bulk products

     our  distribution  centers  are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis  the  distribution  centers
utilize  computerassisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores  in  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores we have established a  satellitebased  data interchange
system among those stores in which  highspeed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available  the distribution  center which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters

     we  believe  that  our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventorycarrying   costs   improving  our  store  instock   positions   and
controlling and managing our inventory  moreover we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas
our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center  as part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2004 we plan to

o    continue to implement  improvement plans to increase  inventory turnover in
     all distribution centers and

o    upgrade  material  handling  equipment  in  several   distribution  centers
     including conveyor systems forklifts and racking

marketing

     marketing  to the  diy  customer  we  aggressively  promote  sales  to diy
customers through an extensive  advertising program  which includes direct mail
and newspaper  radio and television advertising in selected markets we believe
that our  advertising  and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant
name recognition in each of our market areas newspaper and radio advertisements
are generally directed towards specific product and price promotions frequently
in connection with specific sale events and promotions  to promote sales to car
enthusiasts  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally we sponsor 16 nationally televised races and
over 288  motorsports  races and car shows at over 200  facilities in 18 states
including  the nascar  craftsmen truck series  the nascar busch series race in
dallas  five  national  hotrod  racing  association  races in topeka  memphis
houston and dallas  as well as the oreilly chili bowl  oreilly auto parts is
the  official  auto parts  store of texas  motor  speedway  kansas  speedway
bristol  motor  speedway   houston  raceway  park  texas  motorplex   memphis
motorsports  park and heartland  park  during 2003 we started work on branding
the oreilly name in the ncaa  our first  initiative  was to partner with texas
tech  university  through a variety of programs  including  sponsoring  of coach
knights  tv show  ads during  games  placing  the  oreilly  logo on the home
basketball court and coach knights  sweater  advertising on the backs of seats
and banners for the scoring  table  this has lead to  additional  opportunities
with  approximately 14 colleges in our current  markets  we have found that the
more progressive  marketing concepts utilized in the diy portion of our business
can also be applied to increase sales to our professional installer customers

     marketing  to the  professional  installer  we  have  over  173  fulltime
oreilly  sales  representatives  strategically  located  in  the  more  densely
populated  market areas that we serve  and each is dedicated  solely to calling
upon and selling to the professional installer our first call program which is
our commitment to the professional  customer  includes a dedicated sales force
sales and  promotions  directed  to the  professional  installer  and  overnight
delivery  service from the  distribution  center to the  professional  customer
moreover  each district manager and store manager  throughout our store network
calls upon  existing and  potential new  professional  installer  customers on a
regular basis our first call marketing  strategy  with respect to professional
installers emphasizes our ability to offer

o    prompt delivery using small trucks or vans operated by virtually all of our
     stores

o    a separate  counter in all of our stores  dedicated  exclusively to serving
     professional installers

o    trade credit for qualified professional installers

o    broad inventory of merchandise and competitive pricing

o    a  professional  installer  computer  system that connects  directly to our
     inventory system and

o    seminars concerning topics of interest to professional installers  such as
     technical updates safety and general business management

     marketing to the independently  owned parts store along with the operation
of the distribution  centers and the distribution of automotive  products to the
oreilly  stores  ozark  automotive  distributors   inc  ozark  also  sells
automotive  products to independently owned parts stores whose retail stores are
generally  located in areas not serviced by an oreilly  store  we generally do
not compete with any independently owned parts store to which we sell automotive
products   but  have  on  occasion   acquired  the  business   assets  of  an
independently  owned  parts  store  supplied by ozark  ozark  operates  its own
separate  marketing program to independently  owned parts stores through a staff
of three

     of  the  approximately  215  independently  owned  parts  stores  currently
purchasing  automotive  products from ozark  211  participate in the auto value
program through ozark as a participant in this program  an independently owned
parts store which meets certain minimum  financial and operational  standards is
permitted to indicate its auto value membership  through the display of the auto
value logo which is owned by the alliance  inc  formerly known as auto value

the specific needs of each store  each of our 106 district managers has general
supervisory  responsibility  for an average of 10 stores  within such  managers

personnel

professional parts people

     we  believe  our  highly  trained  team of  professional  parts  people  is
essential in providing  superior service both to diy and professional  installer
customers  each of our professional  parts people is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer
in addition  we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts
we believe  that the ability of our  professional  parts  people to provide such
assistance  to  the  diy  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customers visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
diy business

     we  screen  prospective  employees  whom we refer to as team  members  to
identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts
or repairs or an aptitude for automotive  knowledge  each person who becomes a

designed to  introduce  the team member to our culture and his or her job duties
before being assigned specific job  responsibilities  the successful completion
of additional training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a
parts  specialist  and  thus  able to work at the  parts  counter  of one of our
stores all new counter people are required to successfully complete a sixmonth
basic  automotive  systems  training course and are then enrolled in a sixmonth
advanced  automotive  systems course for certification by the national institute
for automotive service  excellence ase  which administers  national exams for

customer service

experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide
selection of automotive  products  we believe that the  satisfaction of diy and

provide  in a  timely  fashion  the  specific  automotive  product  requested
accordingly  each  oreilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications   we
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace

pricing

     we believe that a competitive  pricing  policy is essential  within product
categories  in order to  compete  successfully  product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store  most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing  consistent
with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price
on any instock product of the same or comparable  quality offered by any of our
competitors

competition

     we  compete  in both the diy and  professional  installer  portions  of the
automotive aftermarket we compete primarily with

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive

     both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly
competitive  particularly  in the more densely  populated  areas that we serve
some of our  competitors  are  larger  than we are and  have  greater  financial
resources  in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall
but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market for a list of our
principal  competitors  see the competition  section of item 1 of this form

we cannot assure future growth

     we believe  that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future  failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock  our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather
conditions  zoning and other issues related to new store site development  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions  we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2004 and beyond will be
achieved  for a  discussion  of our  growth  strategies  see the  growth  and
expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10k

acquisitions may not lead to expected growth

     we expect to  continue  to make  acquisitions  as an  element of our growth
strategy  acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth
to differ from our expectations for example 1 we may not be able to continue
to identify suitable  acquisition  candidates or to acquire additional companies
at favorable prices or on other favorable terms 2 our managements  attention
may be distracted  3 we may fail to retain key acquired personnel 4 we may
assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems and 5 we may not be
able to successfully integrate the operations accounting and billing functions
for example of businesses we acquire to realize economic operational and other
benefits


sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions

     all of our stores are located in the central and southern united states in
particular approximately 34 of our stores are located in texas therefore our
business is sensitive to the economic and weather  conditions of these  regions
unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales particularly to diy
customers

dependence upon key and other personnel

     our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain  key
personnel  including david oreilly ted wise greg henslee and jim batten our
business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the
loss of the  services  of one or more of these  individuals  additionally  our
successful  implementation and management of our growth and expansion strategies
will  depend  on our  ability  to  continue  to  attract  and  retain  qualified
personnel  we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue  to attract  such
personnel  for a further  discussion of our management  and personnel  see the
business  section  of item 1 and item 4a of this  form  10k  and our  proxy
statement on schedule 14a for the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders a portion
of which is incorporated herein

significant voting control is held by the oreilly family

     as of the date of this form 10k  the oreilly  family  beneficially  owns
approximately  10 or 5255582 number of shares of the outstanding  shares of
our common stock as a result the oreilly family if they act acting together
represents  one of the largest known blocks of our shares and may continue to be
a significant  factor in any matter voted on by our shareholders  including the
election  of our  directors  and any merger  sale of assets or other  change in
control

possible volatility of our stock price

     the stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock  may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions  the
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts expectations  failure to meet such expectations even slightly could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock  in addition
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies  in the past following periods of volatility in
the market price of a companys  securities  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company  if similar  litigation were
instituted  against us it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our managements attention and resources  which could have an adverse effect on
our business

shares eligible for future sale

     all of the shares of common stock  currently  held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act
of 1933 as amended  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule we cannot predict the effect  if any that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time  sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock  or the perception  that such sales might occur  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock

competitive advantages

     proven  ability to execute  dual market  strategy  we have an  established
track record of serving  both diy  customers  and  professional  installers  we
believe  our  ability  to  execute  a  dual  market  strategy  is a  competitive
advantage which enables us to

o    target a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts

o    capitalize on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure

o    profitably  operate  both in  large  markets  and  less  densely  populated
     geographic areas which typically attract fewer competitors and

o    enhance  service  levels  offered to our diy  customers by offering a broad
     selection of stock keeping units skus and extensive  product  knowledge
     required by professional installers

     we have been  committed to a dual market  strategy  for over 20 years  for
2002 we derived  approximately  54 of our product sales from our diy customers
and approximately 46 from our professional installer customers  as a result of
our  historical  success in executing our dual market  strategy and our over 135
fulltime sales representatives  dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to
the  professional   installer   we  believe  we  will  increase  the  sales  to
professional  installers  and  have a  competitive  advantage  over  our  retail
competitors   who  have  only  recently   entered  and  begun  focusing  on  the
professional installer market

     superior  customer  service  we seek to attract  new diy and  professional
installer  customers  and to retain  existing  customers  by  offering  superior
customer service the key elements of which include

o    superior instore service through highlymotivated  technically proficient
     store personnel  professional parts people using advanced pointofsale
     systems

o    an extensive selection of products

o    attractive stores in convenient locations and

o    competitive pricing with a low price guarantee

     technically  proficient  professional  parts people  our highly proficient
professional parts people provide us with a significant  competitive  advantage
particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional
parts people to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve
the  technicallyoriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis  such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our diy customers  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our professional parts people

     strategic   distribution   systems   we   believe   that  the   geographic
concentration  of our store network in seventeen  contiguous  states  alabama
arkansas   florida  georgia   illinois   indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky
louisiana missouri mississippi  nebraska north carolina oklahoma tennessee
and texas and the strategic  locations of our nine distribution  centers enable
us to  maintain  optimum  inventory  levels  throughout  our store  network  in
addition  our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link
each of our stores to a distribution  center  providing for efficient inventory
control and management our distribution system provides each of our stores with
same day or overnight  access to  approximately  100000 skus many of which are
hard to find items not typically  stocked by other parts  retailers  we believe
the availability of a broad range of products is a key competitive  advantage in
satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business

     experienced management team our management team has a demonstrated ability
to  successfully  execute our business plan  including the  identification  and
integration of strategic acquisitions we have experienced ten consecutive years
of record revenues and earnings growth  we have a strong senior management team
comprised of 49 professionals  who average 17 years of experience with oreilly
in addition  our 93 district  managers  average over 9 years of experience with
us

growth and expansion strategies

     aggressively  open new stores  we intend to continue to aggressively  open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 130 stores in
2003 and  approximately  145  stores in 2004  a  majority  of the sites for our
proposed  2003 store  openings  and several of the sites for our  proposed  2004
store openings have been identified  in selecting sites for new stores we seek
to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order
to achieve  economies  of scale in areas  such as  management  advertising  and
distribution

     until 1986 our expansion was targeted to markets with  populations of less
than  100000  we entered into a more densely  populated  market in august 1986
with the opening of the first of 29 stores in the greater kansas city missouri
market area  of the 106 net new stores added in 2002 2 are located in alabama
3 in arkansas  3 in georgia  7 in illinois  2 in kansas 4 in kentucky  7 in
louisiana 10 in mississippi  7 in missouri 20 in tennessee  and 41 in texas
while we have faced and expect to continue to face more aggressive competition
in the  more  densely  populated  markets  we  believe  that we  have  competed
effectively and that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively
in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit growth within
these markets we also believe that because of our dual market strategy  we are
better  able to  operate  stores in less  densely  populated  areas  within  our
regional  market which would not otherwise  support a national or regional chain
store selling to one portion of the market or the other consequently we expect
to continue to open new stores in less densely populated market areas

     to date  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new
stores  either i by  constructing  a new store at a site which is purchased or
leased  and  stocking  the new store with  fixtures  and  inventory  or ii by
acquiring  an  independently  owned parts  store  typically  by the purchase of
substantially  all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such
store  store  sites are  strategically  located in clusters  within  geographic
areas which complement our distribution system in order to achieve economies of
scale in management  advertising  and distribution costs other key factors we
consider in the site selection  process  include  population  density and growth
patterns age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts the number and type
of  existing  automotive  repair  facilities   auto  parts  stores  and  other
competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such
competitors  when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale

     same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy   to  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business   it  is  customer  satisfaction  whether  of  the  diy  consumer  or
professional installer resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability

                                       4
page

     selectively   pursue  strategic   acquisitions   although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains such as oreilly to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation  thus  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer

     continually enhance store design and location  our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage  higher ceilings
more convenient  interior store layouts  brighter  lighting  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service  we continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design  we  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers

products and purchasing

     our stores offer diy and professional  installer customers a wide selection
of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported  automobiles
vans  and  trucks  we do not  sell  tires  or  perform  automotive  repairs  or
installations  our  merchandise  generally  consists of nationally  recognized
welladvertised  name brand products such as ac delco  moog  murray  wagner
gates rubber federal mogul monroe prestone quaker state pennzoil  castrol
valvoline stp bwd cardone wix armor all and turtle wax in addition to name
brand products  our stores carry a wide variety of  highquality  private label
products  under our  oreilly  auto  parts  superstart  brakebest  ultima and
omnispark  proprietary  name brands  because most of our private label products
are produced by  nationally  recognized  manufacturers  in  accordance  with our
specifications  we believe that the private  label  products  are  generally of
equal or in some cases  better quality than comparable name brand products  a
characteristic which is important to our professional  installer  clientele  we
further  believe that the private label  products are packaged  attractively  to
promote  customer  interest and are generally priced below comparable name brand
products carried in our stores

     we purchase  automotive  products from approximately 400 vendors  the five
largest of which accounted for approximately 25 of our total purchases in 2002
our largest vendor in 2002 accounted for approximately 7 of our total purchases
and the next four largest vendors  accounted for 45 of such purchases each we
have no longterm  contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor
have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory  alternative sources of
supply for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at
substantially  similar costs for substantially all automotive  products that we
sell  it is our  policy  to  take  advantage  of  early  payment  and  seasonal
purchasing  discounts  offered by our vendors  and to utilize  extended  dating
terms  available  from  vendors  due  to  volume  purchasing  we  consider  our
relationships with our suppliers to be good

inflation and seasonality

     we have  been  successful  in many  cases  in  reducing  the  effects  of
merchandise  cost increases  principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive
programs  economies of scale  resulting from increased  volume of purchases and
selective  forward  buying  as a result  we do not believe our operations have
been materially affected by inflation

     our business is seasonal to some extent primarily as a result of the impact
of weather  conditions on store sales store sales and profits have historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  april through  september of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters

store network

     store locations  as a result of our dual market  strategy  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas which would not otherwise  support a national or regional chain

     our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately   22000  skus  and  average
approximately  6700 total square feet in size  at december 31 2002  we had a
total of approximately 66 million square feet in our 981 stores our stores are
served primarily by the nearest distribution center but also have access to the
broader  selection  of  inventory  available  at one of our 46 master  inventory
stores   which  on  average  carry   approximately   38000  skus  and  average
approximately 9400 square feet in size master inventory stores in addition to
serving diy and professional  installer customers in their markets also provide
our other stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection of skus on a
same day basis

     we believe that our stores are  destination  stores  generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity  consequently  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access

     store layout we utilize a computerassisted  planogrammed store layout
system to provide a uniform and consistent  merchandise  presentation  however
some variation occurs in order to meet the specific needs of a particular market
area  merchandise  is  arranged  to provide  easy  customer  access and maximum
selling space keeping highturnover products and accessories within view of the
customer  aisle displays are generally used to feature  highdemand or seasonal
merchandise new items and advertised specials

     store  automation  to enhance store level operations and customer service
we use ibm as400  computer  systems in all of our  stores  these  systems  are
linked  with  the ibm  as400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers our pointofsale  terminals provide immediate access to our electronic
catalog to display  parts and  pricing  information  by make  model and year of
vehicle and use bar code  scanning  technology  to price our  merchandise  this
system speeds  transaction  times  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service   moreover   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management  strategic  planning  inventory
control and distribution efficiency

     new store site  selection  in selecting  sites for new stores  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management  advertising and  distribution  other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include

o    population density and growth patterns

o    age and per capita income

o    vehicle traffic counts

o    the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and

o    the  number  of  auto  parts   stores  and  other   competitors   within  a
     predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors

     when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally  seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale  after  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas this strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market

     in addition adjacent to the springfield  missouri distribution center we
operate  a  36000  square  foot  bulk   merchandise   warehouse  used  for  the
distribution  of  bulk  products  such  as  motor  oil  antifreeze  batteries
lubricants  and other fast  moving  bulk  products  and an 20000  square  foot
returned goods  processing  facility  we also operate a 31000 square foot bulk

with bulk motor oil a tenth distribution center  located in saraland  alabama
near  mobile  alabama  with  approximately  301000  square feet to be used for
distribution  and  approximately  13000 square feet to be used for offices  is
under construction and is expected to open june 2003

     our  distribution  centers  are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis  the  distribution  centers
utilize  computerassisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores  in  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores we have established a  satellitebased  data interchange
system among those stores in which  highspeed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available  the distribution  center which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters

     we  believe  that  our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventorycarrying   costs   improving  our  store  instock   positions   and
controlling and managing our inventory  moreover we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas
our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center  as part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2003 we plan to

o    open a distribution center in the  saralandmobile  alabama area providing
     opportunity for continued expansion in the southeast united states and

     all distribution centers and

o    upgrade  material  handling  equipment  in  several   distribution  centers
     including conveyor systems forklifts and racking

marketing

     marketing  to the  diy  customer  we  aggressively  promote  sales  to diy
customers through an extensive  advertising program  which includes direct mail
and newspaper  radio and television advertising in selected markets we believe
that our  advertising  and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant
name recognition in each of our market areas newspaper and radio advertisements
are generally directed towards specific product and price promotions frequently
in connection with specific sale events and promotions  to promote sales to car
enthusiasts  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally we sponsor 16 nationally televised races and
over 200  motorsports  races and car shows at over 150  racetracks in 17 states
including  the  oreilly  chili bowl  the world of outlaws  series  the nascar
craftsmen truck series as well as four national hotrod racing association races
in topeka  memphis  houston and dallas  oreilly  auto parts is the official
auto parts  store of texas  motor  speedway  kansas  speedway  bristol  motor
speedway  houston raceway park texas motorplex  memphis  motorsports park and
heartland  park  we have found  that the more  progressive  marketing  concepts
utilized  in the diy  portion of our  business  can also be applied to  increase
sales to our professional installer customers

     marketing  to the  professional  installer  we  have  over  135  fulltime
oreilly  sales  representatives  strategically  located  in  the  more  densely
populated  market areas that we serve  and each is dedicated  solely to calling
upon and selling to the professional installer our first call program which is
our commitment to the professional  customer  includes a dedicated sales force
sales and  promotions  directed  to the  professional  installer  and  overnight
delivery  service from the  distribution  center to the  professional  customer
moreover  each district manager and store manager  throughout our store network
calls upon  existing and  potential new  professional  installer  customers on a
regular basis our first call marketing  strategy  with respect to professional
installers emphasizes our ability to offer

o    prompt delivery using small trucks or vans operated by most of our stores

o    a separate counter in most of our stores  dedicated  exclusively to serving
     professional installers

o    trade credit for qualified professional installers

o    broad inventory of merchandise and competitive pricing

o    a  professional  installer  computer  system that connects  directly to our
     inventory system and

o    seminars concerning topics of interest to professional installers  such as
     technical updates safety and general business management

     marketing to the independently  owned parts store along with the operation
of the distribution  centers and the distribution of automotive  products to the
oreilly  stores  ozark  automotive  distributors  inc  ozark  also sells
automotive  products to independently owned parts stores whose retail stores are
generally  located in areas not serviced by an oreilly  store  we generally do
not compete with any independently owned parts store to which we sell automotive
products   but  have  on  occasion   acquired  the  business   assets  of  an
independently  owned  parts  store  supplied by ozark  ozark  operates  its own
separate  marketing program to independently  owned parts stores through a staff
of three

     of  the  approximately  230  independently  owned  parts  stores  currently
purchasing  automotive  products from ozark  219  participate in the auto value
program through ozark as a participant in this program  an independently owned
parts store which meets certain minimum  financial and operational  standards is
permitted to indicate its auto value membership  through the display of the auto
value logo which is owned by the alliance  inc  formerly known as auto value
associates  inc a nonprofit buying group consisting of approximately  4500
members as of december 31 2002 including oreilly engaged in the distribution
or sale  of  automotive  products  additionally  we  provide  advertising  and
promotional  assistance to auto value stores purchasing automotive products from
ozark  as well as marketing  and sales  support  in return for a commitment to

inventory control

management structure

     each of our  stores  is  staffed  with a  store  manager  and an  assistant
manager in addition to the parts specialists and support staff required to meet
the specific needs of each store  each of our 93 district  managers has general
supervisory  responsibility  for an average of 105 stores within such managers

personnel

an average length of service with the company of over 9 years

professional parts people

     we  believe  our  highly  trained  team of  professional  parts  people  is
essential in providing  superior service both to diy and professional  installer
customers  each of our professional  parts people is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer
in addition  we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts
we believe  that the ability of our  professional  parts  people to provide such
assistance  to  the  diy  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customers visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
diy business

     we  screen  prospective  employees  whom we refer to as team  members  to
identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts
or repairs or an aptitude for automotive  knowledge  each person who becomes a
team member first  participates  in an  intensive  twoday  orientation  program
designed to  introduce  the team member to our culture and his or her job duties
before being assigned specific job  responsibilities  the successful completion
of additional training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a
parts  specialist  and  thus  able to work at the  parts  counter  of one of our
stores all new counter people are required to successfully complete a sixmonth
basic  automotive  systems  training course and are then enrolled in a sixmonth

experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide
selection of automotive  products  we believe that the  satisfaction of diy and
professional installer customers is substantially  dependent upon our ability to
provide  in a  timely  fashion  the  specific  automotive  product  requested
accordingly  each  oreilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications   we
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace

pricing

     we believe that a competitive  pricing  policy is essential  within product
categories  in order to  compete  successfully  product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store  most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing  consistent
with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price
on any instock product of the same or comparable  quality offered by any of our
competitors

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive

     both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly
competitive  particularly  in the more densely  populated  areas that we serve
some of our  competitors  are  larger  than we are and  have  greater  financial
resources  in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall
but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market for a list of our
principal  competitors  see the  competition  section  of item 1 of this form

we cannot assure future growth

     we believe  that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future  failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock  our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather
conditions  zoning and other issues related to new store site development  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions  we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2003 and beyond will be
achieved  for a  discussion  of our  growth  strategies  see the  growth  and
expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10k

acquisitions may not lead to expected growth

     we expect to  continue  to make  acquisitions  as an  element of our growth
strategy  acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth
to differ from our expectations for example 1 we may not be able to continue
to identify suitable  acquisition  candidates or to acquire additional companies
at favorable prices or on other favorable terms 2 our managements  attention
may be distracted  3 we may fail to retain key acquired personnel 4 we may
assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems and 5 we may not be
able to successfully integrate the operations accounting and billing functions
for example of businesses we acquire to realize economic operational and other
benefits


sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions

     all of our stores are located in the central and southern united states in
particular approximately 37 of our stores are located in texas therefore our
business is sensitive to the economic and weather  conditions of these  regions
unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales particularly to diy
customers

dependence upon key and other personnel

     our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain  key
personnel  including david e oreilly  lawrence p oreilly  ted f wise and
greg l  henslee  one  key  person  lawrence  p  oreilly  retired  from  his
operational  duties in february 2003 but will continue to serve on the board of
directors  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected  by the  loss of the  services  of one or more  of  these  individuals
additionally  our  successful  implementation  and management of our growth and
expansion  strategies  will  depend on our  ability to  continue  to attract and
retain qualified  personnel  we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue
to attract  such  personnel  for a further  discussion  of our  management  and
personnel  see the  business  section of item 1 and item 4a of this form 10k

approximately  13 of the  outstanding  shares of our common stock as a result
the  oreilly  family  acting  together  will  continue  to be able to  exercise
significant  voting  control  over the  company  including  the election of our
directors and on any other matter being voted on by our shareholders  including
any merger sale of assets or other change in control

possible volatility of our stock price

     the stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock  may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions  the
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts expectations  failure to meet such expectations even slightly could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock  in addition
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies  in the past following periods of volatility in
the market price of a companys  securities  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company  if similar  litigation were
instituted  against us it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our managements attention and resources  which could have an adverse effect on
our business

shares eligible for future sale

     all of the shares of common stock  currently  held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act
of 1933 as amended  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule we cannot predict the effect  if any that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time  sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock  or the perception  that such sales might occur  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock

chub oreilly  sr one of our current  directors  and initially operated
from a single store in  springfield  missouri  the oreilly family has managed
the company since our inception

     our goal is to continue  to achieve  growth in sales and  profitability  by
capitalizing  on  our  competitive  advantages  and  executing  our  growth  and
expansion strategies

     see risk factors  beginning on page 11 for a description of certain risks
relevant to our  business  these risk  factors  include  among  others  risks
related  to  competition  in the  automotive  aftermarket  business  our growth
strategy  our acquisition  strategy  our sensitivity to regional  economic and
weather  conditions  our  dependence  upon  key  and  other  personnel  and the
significant voting control held by our principal shareholders

competitive advantages

     proven  ability to execute  dual market  strategy  we have an  established
track record of serving both  doityourself  diy customers and professional
installers  we  believe  our  ability to execute a dual  market  strategy  is a
competitive advantage which enables us to

o target a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts
o capitalize on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure
o profitably operate both in large markets and less densely populated geographic
  areas which typically attract fewer competitors and
o enhance  service  levels  offered  to our diy  customers  by  offering a broad
  selection of stock keeping units  skus  and  extensive product knowledge
  required by professional installers
                                       2
page

     we have been  committed to a dual market  strategy  for over 20 years  for
2001 we derived  approximately  56 of our product sales from our diy customers
and approximately 44 from our professional installer customers  as a result of
our  historical  success in executing our dual market  strategy and our over 125
fulltime sales representatives  dedicated solely to calling upon and selling to
the  professional   installer   we  believe  we  will  increase  the  sales  to
professional  installers  and  have a  competitive  advantage  over  our  retail
competitors   who  have  only  recently   entered  and  begun  focusing  on  the
professional installer market

     superior  customer  service  we seek to attract  new diy and  professional
installer  customers  and to retain  existing  customers  by  offering  superior
customer service the key elements of which include

o superior  instore service through  highlymotivated  technically  proficient
  store personnel professional parts  people using advanced  pointofsale
  systems
o an extensive selection of products
o attractive stores in convenient locations and
o competitive pricing with a low price guarantee

     technically  proficient  professional  parts people  our highly proficient
professional parts people provide us with a significant  competitive  advantage
particularly over less specialized retail operators we require our professional
parts people to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve
the  technicallyoriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis  such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our diy customers  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our professional parts people

     strategic   distribution   systems   we   believe   that  the   geographic
concentration  of our store  network  in  sixteen  contiguous  states  alabama
arkansas   florida  georgia   illinois   indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky
louisiana missouri  mississippi  nebraska oklahoma tennessee and texas and
the strategic  locations of our nine distribution  centers enable us to maintain
optimum  inventory  levels  throughout  our  store  network  in  addition  our
inventory  management and distribution  systems  electronically link each of our
stores to a distribution  center  providing for efficient inventory control and
management our distribution system provides each of our stores with same day or
overnight access to  approximately  113000 skus many of which are hard to find
items  not  typically   stocked  by  other  parts  retailers   we  believe  the
availability  of a broad  range of products is a key  competitive  advantage  in
satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business

     experienced management team our management team has a demonstrated ability
to  successfully  execute our business plan  including the  identification  and
integration of strategic  acquisitions  we have  experienced  nine  consecutive
years of record revenues and earnings growth we have a strong senior management
team  comprised  of 48  professionals  who average 18 years of  experience  with

growth and expansion strategies

     aggressively  open new stores  we intend to continue to aggressively  open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 100 stores in
2002 and  approximately  120  stores in 2003  a  majority  of the sites for our
proposed  2002 store  openings  and several of the sites for our  proposed  2003
store openings have been identified  in selecting sites for new stores we seek
to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order
to achieve  economies  of scale in areas  such as  management  advertising  and
distribution

     until 1986 our expansion was targeted to markets with  populations of less
than  100000  we entered into a more densely  populated  market in august 1986
with the opening of the first of 29 stores in the greater kansas city missouri
market area of the 203 net new stores added in 2001 16 are located in alabama
33 in arkansas  4 in florida 5 in georgia  2 in illinois  5 in indiana 8 in
iowa 2 in kansas  7 in  kentucky  10 in  louisiana  6 in  mississippi  7 in
missouri 2 in nebraska 4 in oklahoma 41 in tennessee  and 51 in texas 82 of
the 203 net new stores  added in 2002  related to our  acquisition  of midstate
automotive  midstate  while we have faced and expect to continue to face
more aggressive  competition in the more densely populated  markets  we believe
that we have competed  effectively  and that we are well positioned to continue
to compete effectively  in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales
and profit growth within these markets we also believe that because of our dual
market strategy  we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated
areas within our regional market which would not otherwise support a national or
regional  chain  store  selling  to one  portion  of the  market  or the  other
consequently we expect to continue to open new stores in less densely populated
market areas

     to date  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new
stores  either i by  constructing  a new store at a site which is purchased or
leased  and  stocking  the new store with  fixtures  and  inventory  or ii by
acquiring  an  independently  owned parts  store  typically  by the purchase of
substantially  all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such
store  store  sites are  strategically  located in clusters  within  geographic
areas which complement our distribution system in order to achieve economies of
scale in management  advertising  and distribution costs other key factors we
consider in the site selection  process  include  population  density and growth
patterns age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts the number and type
of  existing  automotive  repair  facilities   auto  parts  stores  and  other
competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such
competitors  when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale

     same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy   to  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business   it  is  customer  satisfaction  whether  of  the  diy  consumer  or
professional installer resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability

     selectively   pursue  strategic   acquisitions   although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains such as oreilly to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation  thus  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer

     continually enhance store design and location  our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage  higher ceilings
more convenient  interior store layouts  brighter  lighting  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service  we continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design  we  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers

products and purchasing

     our stores offer diy and professional  installer customers a wide selection
of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported  automobiles
vans  and  trucks  we do not  sell  tires  or  perform  automotive  repairs  or
installations  our  merchandise  generally  consists of nationally  recognized
welladvertised  name brand products such as ac delco  moog  murray  wagner
gates rubber federal mogul monroe prestone quaker state pennzoil  castrol
valvoline stp bwd cardone wix armor all and turtle wax in addition to name
brand products  our stores carry a wide variety of  highquality  private label
products  under  the  parts  master  name  brand and our  oreilly  auto  parts
superstart  brakebest  ultima and omnispark  proprietary name brands  because
most of our  private  label  products  are  produced  by  nationally  recognized
manufacturers in accordance with our specifications we believe that the private
label  products are  generally of equal or in some cases  better  quality than
comparable  name brand  products  a  characteristic  which is  important to our
professional  installer  clientele  we further  believe that the private  label
products  are  packaged  attractively  to  promote  customer  interest  and  are
generally priced below comparable name brand products carried in our stores

     we purchase  automotive  products from approximately 400 vendors  the five
largest of which accounted for approximately 25 of our total purchases in 2001
our largest vendor in 2001 accounted for approximately 7 of our total purchases
and the next four largest vendors  accounted for 45 of such purchases each we
have no longterm  contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors nor
have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory  alternative sources of
supply for automotive parts we believe that alternative supply sources exist at
substantially  similar costs for substantially all automotive  products that we
sell  it is our  policy  to  take  advantage  of  early  payment  and  seasonal
purchasing  discounts  offered by our vendors  and to utilize  extended  dating
terms  available  from  vendors  due  to  volume  purchasing  we  consider  our
relationships with our suppliers to be good

store network

     store locations  as a result of our dual market  strategy  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas which would not otherwise  support a national or regional chain
selling to just one portion of the automotive  aftermarket  the following table
sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores

     our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately   22000  skus  and  average
approximately  6700 total square feet in size  at december 31 2001  we had a
total of  approximately  588 million square feet in our 875 stores  our stores
are served primarily by the nearest distribution center but also have access to
the broader  selection of inventory  available at one of our 38 master inventory
stores   which  on  average  carry   approximately   38000  skus  and  average
approximately 9400 square feet in size master inventory stores in addition to
serving diy and professional  installer customers in their markets also provide
our other stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection of skus on a
same day basis

     we believe that our stores are destination  stores generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity  consequently  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access

     store  layout  we  utilize a  computerassisted  planogrammed  store
layout  system to provide a uniform  and  consistent  merchandise  presentation
however  some  variation  occurs  in  order  to meet  the  specific  needs of a
particular market area  merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access
and maximum selling space keeping highturnover products and accessories within
view of the customer  aisle displays are generally used to feature  highdemand
or seasonal merchandise new items and advertised specials

     store  automation  to enhance store level operations and customer service
we use ibm as400  computer  systems in all of our  stores  these  systems  are
linked  with  the ibm  as400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers our pointofsale  terminals provide immediate access to our electronic
catalog to display  parts and  pricing  information  by make  model and year of
vehicle and use bar code  scanning  technology  to price our  merchandise  this
system speeds  transaction  times  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service   moreover   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management  strategic  planning  inventory
control and distribution efficiency

     new store site  selection  in selecting  sites for new stores  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management  advertising and  distribution  other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include
                                       6
page


o population density and growth patterns
o age and per capita income
o vehicle traffic counts
o the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and
o the number of auto parts stores and other competitors  within a predetermined
  radius and the operational strength of such competitors

     when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally  seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale  after  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas this strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market

     the nashville  tennessee and knoxville  tennessee  distribution centers
were added in october 2001  which related to our  acquisition of midstate  in
addition adjacent to the springfield missouri distribution center we operate
a 36000 square foot bulk  merchandise  warehouse used for the  distribution  of
bulk products such as motor oil  antifreeze  batteries  lubricants  and other
fast moving bulk products  and an 18000 square foot returned goods  processing
facility  the  nashville  tennessee  distribution  center  has a 97000  bulk
facility  that is operated for the  distribution  of paint  body and  equipment
supplies we also operate a 22500 square foot bulk warehouse in mcallen texas
that serves the surrounding distribution centers with bulk motor oil

     our  distribution  centers  are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis  the  distribution  centers
utilize  computerassisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores  in  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores we have established a  satellitebased  data interchange
system among those stores in which  highspeed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available  the distribution  center which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters

     we  believe  that  our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventorycarrying   costs   improving  our  store  instock   positions   and
controlling and managing our inventory  moreover we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas
our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center  as part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2002 we plan to
                                       7

o initiate full utilization of the nashville and knoxville  distribution centers
  to be served by all stores in those surrounding areas
o implement improvement plans to increase inventory turnover in all distribution
  centers and
o upgrade  merchandise  handling  equipment  in  several  distribution  centers
  including conveyor systems forklifts and racking

marketing

     marketing  to the  diy  customer  we  aggressively  promote  sales  to diy
customers through an extensive  advertising program  which includes direct mail
and newspaper  radio and television advertising in selected markets we believe
that our  advertising  and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant
name recognition in each of our market areas newspaper and radio advertisements
are generally directed towards specific product and price promotions frequently
in connection with specific sale events and promotions  to promote sales to car
enthusiasts  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally we sponsor 12 nationally televised races and
over 85  motorsports  races  and car shows at over 125  racetracks  in 9 states
including  the  oreilly  chili bowl  the world of outlaws  series  the nascar
craftsmen truck series as well as four national hotrod racing association races
in houston and dallas  for the next year we will also sponsor the nascar busch
series  races and winston  cup  qualifying  in  addition  to 2 more  nationally
televised  races  we have found that the more  progressive  marketing  concepts
utilized  in the diy  portion of our  business  can also be applied to  increase
sales to our professional installer customers

     marketing  to the  professional  installer  we  have  over  125  fulltime
oreilly  sales  representatives  strategically  located  in  the  more  densely
populated  market areas that we serve  and each is dedicated  solely to calling
upon and selling to the professional installer our first call program which is
our commitment to the professional  customer  includes a dedicated sales force
sales and  promotions  directed  to the  professional  installer  and  overnight
delivery  service from the  distribution  center to the  professional  customer
moreover  each district manager and store manager  throughout our store network
calls upon  existing and  potential new  professional  installer  customers on a
regular basis our first call marketing  strategy  with respect to professional
installers emphasizes our ability to offer

o a  separate  counter in most of our stores  dedicated  exclusively  to serving
  professional installers
o trade credit for qualified professional installers
o broad inventory of merchandise and competitive pricing

  technical updates safety and general business management

     marketing to the independently  owned parts store along with the operation
of the distribution  centers and the distribution of automotive  products to the
oreilly  stores  ozark  automotive  distributors  inc  ozark  also sells
automotive  products to independently owned parts stores whose retail stores are
generally  located in areas not serviced by an oreilly  store  we generally do
not compete with any independently owned parts store to which we sell automotive
products   but  have  on  occasion   acquired  the  business   assets  of  an
independently  owned  parts  store  supplied by ozark  ozark  operates  its own
separate  marketing program to independently  owned parts stores through a staff
of 14

independently  owned parts store by  providing  loan  guarantees  and  financing
secured by inventory furniture and fixtures making available computer software
for  inventory  control  and  performing   certain  accounting  and  bookkeeping
functions

management structure

     each of our  stores  is  staffed  with a  store  manager  and an  assistant
manager in addition to the parts specialists and support staff required to meet
the specific needs of each store  each of our 82 district  managers has general
supervisory  responsibility  for an average of 11 stores  within such  managers

personnel

an average length of service with the company of over 9 years


professional parts people

     we  believe  our  highly  trained  team of  professional  parts  people  is
essential in providing  superior service both to diy and professional  installer
customers  each of our professional  parts people is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer
in addition  we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts
we believe  that the ability of our  professional  parts  people to provide such
assistance  to  the  diy  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customers visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
diy business
                                       9

development


customer service

     we seek to provide our customers  with an efficient  and pleasant  instore
experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide
selection of automotive  products  we believe that the  satisfaction of diy and
professional installer customers is substantially  dependent upon our ability to
provide  in a  timely  fashion  the  specific  automotive  product  requested
accordingly  each  oreilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications   we
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace


pricing

     we believe that a competitive  pricing  policy is essential  within product
categories  in order to  compete  successfully  product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store  most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing  consistent
with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price
on any instock product of the same or comparable  quality offered by any of our
competitors

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive

     both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly
competitive  particularly  in the more densely  populated  areas that we serve
some of our  competitors  are  larger  than we are and  have  greater  financial
resources  in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall
but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market for a list of our
principal  competitors  see the competition  section of item 1 of this form

we cannot assure future growth

     we believe  that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future  failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock  our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather
conditions  zoning and other issues related to new store site development  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions  we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2002 and beyond will be
achieved  for a  discussion  of our growth  strategies  see the  growth  and
expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10k

acquisitions may not lead to expected growth

     we expect to  continue  to make  acquisitions  as an  element of our growth
strategy  acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth
to differ from our expectations for example 1 we may not be able to continue
to identify suitable  acquisition  candidates or to acquire additional companies
at favorable prices or on other favorable terms 2 our managements  attention
may be distracted  3 we may fail to retain key acquired personnel 4 we may
assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems and 5 we may not be
able to successfully integrate the operations accounting and billing functions
for example of businesses we acquire to realize economic operational and other
benefits

sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions

     all of our stores are located in the central and southern united states in
particular approximately 37 of our stores are located in texas therefore our
business is sensitive to the economic and weather  conditions of these  regions
unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales particularly to diy
customers

dependence upon key and other personnel

     our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain  key
personnel  including  david e  oreilly  lawrence  p  oreilly  charles  h
oreilly  jr rosalie oreilly wooten ted f wise and greg l henslee two of
our key personnel  charles h oreilly  jr and rosalie  oreilly  wooten have
retired from their  operational  duties  but both will continue to serve on the
board of directors  our business and results of operations  could be materially
adversely  affected  by the  loss  of the  services  of one  or  more  of  these
individuals  additionally  our successful implementation and management of our
growth and  expansion  strategies  will  depend on our  ability to  continue  to
attract and retain qualified  personnel  we cannot be sure that we will be able
to  continue  to  attract  such  personnel  for a  further  discussion  of  our
management and personnel  see the business section of item 1 and item 4a of
this form 10k and our  proxy  statement  on  schedule  14a for the 2002  annual
meeting of shareholders a portion of which is incorporated herein

significant voting control is held by the oreilly family

     as of the date of this  form 10k the  oreilly  family  beneficially  owns
approximately  148 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result
the  oreilly  family  acting  together  will  continue  to be able to  exercise
significant  voting  control  over the  company  including  the election of our
directors and on any other matter being voted on by our shareholders  including
any merger sale of assets or other change in control

possible volatility of our stock price

     the stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock  may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions  the
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts expectations  failure to meet such expectations even slightly could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock  in addition
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies  in the past following periods of volatility in
the market price of a companys  securities  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company  if similar  litigation were
instituted  against us it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our managements attention and resources  which could have an adverse effect on
our business

shares eligible for future sale

     all of the shares of common stock  currently  held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act
of 1933 as amended  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule we cannot predict the effect  if any that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time  sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock  or the perception  that such sales might occur  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock

     of the 875 stores that we operated at december  31  2001  262 stores were
owned  544 stores  were  leased  from  unaffiliated  parties and 69 stores were
leased  from  one of two  real  estate  investment  partnerships  and a  limited
liability  corporation  formed by the oreilly family  leases with unaffiliated
parties generally  provide for payment of a fixed base rent  payment of certain
tax  insurance  and  maintenance  expenses  and an original  term of 10 years
subject to one or more  renewals at our option  the original  terms of 8 stores
leased  from  unaffiliated  parties  expired  prior to the end of 2001 that were
subsequently renewed we have entered into separate master lease agreements with
each of the affiliated real estate investment  partnerships for the occupancy of
the stores covered thereby such master lease agreements expired on december 31
1998  and were renewed  through  december  31 2004  we believe that the lease
agreements with the affiliated real estate investment  partnerships are on terms
comparable to those obtainable from third parties

     we  believe  that  our  present  facilities  are  in  good  condition  are
adequately insured and together with those under construction  are suitable and
adequate for the conduct of our current operations



item 3  legal proceedings

     we are a defendant in a lawsuit  entitled coalition  for a level  playing
field  llc  et al v  autozone  inc  et  al in the united  states
district  court for the eastern  district of new york  the over 100  plaintiffs
consist  primarily  of  warehouse   distributors  and  jobbers  and  the  eight
defendants  are  principally   automotive   aftermarket  parts  retailers   the
plaintiffs  allege  that  the  defendants  violated  certain  provisions  of the
robinsonpatman   act  by  receiving   and  inducing   various  forms  of  price
discrimination  from  manufacturers  of automotive  parts  the plaintiffs  seek
compensatory  damages  as well as injunctive and other  equitable  relief  we
along  with the other  defendants  filed a motion to  dismiss  this  action and
subsequently  on october 23 2001 the court overruled a substantial portion of
the  defendants  motion  we believe the claims are without merit and that this
lawsuit will not have a material  adverse effect on our  consolidated  financial
position results of operations or cash flows

     we were  involved in  litigation  as a result of a complaint  filed against
hilo in may 1997  the  plaintiff  in this  lawsuit  sought to  certify a class
action on behalf of persons or  entities in the states of texas  louisiana  and
california that had purchased a battery from hilo since may 1990 the complaint
alleged that hilo  offered and sold  old  used and out of warranty
batteries as if the batteries  were new  resulting in claims for  violations of
deceptive trade  practices  breach of contract  negligence  fraud  negligent
misrepresentation  and breach of  warranty  on january 15  2001  we reached a
favorable verbal settlement with the plaintiffs counsel the settlement  which
was not significant and was accrued at december 31 2001 and 2000 was approved
on october 18 2001 by the 60th judicial district court of texas

     in addition we are involved in various other legal proceedings  incidental
to the  conduct of its  business  although  we cannot  ascertain  the amount of
liability  that it may incur from any of these  matters  it does not  currently
believe that in the aggregate  they will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

information  that allows a reader to comprehend  the business  activities of our
company to aid in that  understanding  management has identified our critical
accounting  policies  these  policies  have  the  potential  to  have  a  more
significant  impact  on  our  financials  statements   either  because  of  the
significance  of the financial  statement item to which they relate  or because
they  require  judgment  and  estimation  due to  the  uncertainty  involved  in

2001 compared to 2000

     product sales  increased  2017  million  or 227 from 8904 million in
2000 to 109 billion in 2001 primarily due to 121 net additional stores opened
during 2001  an 88  increase in  samestore  product sales for stores open at
least one year and the  acquisition of 82 stores in connection with the purchase
of midstate  effective  october 1 2001 we believe that the increased product
sales  achieved  by the  existing  stores  are the result of our  offering  of a
broader  selection of products in most  stores  an  increased  promotional  and
advertising effort through a variety of media and localized  promotional events
and continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores
also  our continued  focus on serving  professional  installers  contributed to
increased sales

     gross  profit  increased  222 from  3827  million  or 430 of product
sales in 2000 to 4678 million or 428 of product sales in 2001

     operating  selling  general and  administrative  expenses increased 613
million  from  2927  million  or  329 of  product  sales in 2000 to 3540
million or 324 of product  sales in 2001  the increase in these expenses in
dollar amount was  primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations

     other expense net increased by 234000 from 69 million in 2000 to 71
million in 2001 the increase was primarily due to interest expense on increased
debt levels  related to the issuing of 100 million of senior  notes  partially
offset by lower  interest  expense  on  borrowings  under the  revolving  credit
facility due to lower interest rates

     provision  for income  taxes  increased  from 315  million in 2000 378
effective  tax rate to 404 million in 2001 378  effective  tax rate  the
increase  in the dollar  amount was due to the  increase in the amount of income
before income taxes

     principally  as a result  of the  foregoing  net  income in 2001 was 664
million or 61 of product sales an increase of 146 million or 283 from
net income in 2000 of 517 million or 58 of product sales

2000 compared to 1999

     product sales  increased  1363  million  or 181 from 7541 million in
1999 to 8904 million in 2000  due to 101 net additional  stores opened during
2000  and a 280  million  or 40 increase in  samestore  product sales for
stores opened in both full periods  we believe that the increased product sales
achieved  by the  existing  stores are the result of our  offering  of a broader
selection of products in most stores  an increased  promotional and advertising
effort  through  a  variety  of media  and  localized  promotional  events  and
continued  improvement  in the  merchandising  and store layouts of most stores
also  our continued  focus on serving  professional  installers  contributed to

     gross  profit  increased  176 from  3253  million  or 431 of product
sales in 1999 to 3827 million or 430 of product sales in 2000

     operating  selling  general and  administrative  expenses increased 443
million  from  2484  million  or  329 of  product  sales in 1999 to 2927
million or 329 of product  sales in 2000  the increase in these expenses in
dollar amount was  primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations

     other expense  net increased by 30 million from 39 million in 1999 to
69  million in 2000  the increase was  primarily  due to interest  expense on
increased borrowings under our credit facility

     provision  for income  taxes  increased  from 274  million in 1999 375
effective  tax rate to 315 million in 2000 378  effective  tax rate  the
increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to the increase of income before
income taxes  the nominal  increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due
to changes in the  apportionment  of sales  between  states with  differing  tax
rates

     principally  as a result  of the  foregoing  net  income in 2000 was 517
million or 58 of product sales  an increase of 61 million or 133 from
net income in 1999 of 456 million or 61 of product sales

million in 2000 and 316  million in 1999  the  increase  in cash  provided by
operating  activities  in 2001 compared to 2000 is largely the result of smaller
increases in inventory  increased net income and to a lessor extent increased
accrued benefits and  withholdings  this increase in cash provided by operating
activities  in 2001  compared to 2000 was  partially  offset by the  increase in
amounts  receivable  from  vendors and a decrease in accounts  payable and other
current  liabilities  the decrease in cash provided by operating  activities in
2000 compared to 1999 is the result of an increase in inventory and to a lesser
extent  increases in accounts  receivable and amounts  receivable from vendors
partially  offset by  increases  in net  income  accounts  payable  and accrued
payroll

     net cash used in  investing  activities  was 778  million in 2001  405
million  in 2000  and  797  million  in 1999  the  increase  in cash  used in
investing  activities  in 2001 was largely due to the  purchase of  midstate as
discussed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements  and a significant
reduction  in the amount of proceeds  received  from the sales of  property  and
equipment the decrease in cash used in 2000 compared to

1999 was  primarily  due to proceeds  from the sale of 90  properties  for 523
million in a saleleaseback transaction

     on december 15 2000  we entered  into a 50 million  synthetic  operating
lease facility the  facility with a group of financial  institutions  under
the facility  the lessor  acquires land to be developed for oreilly auto parts
stores  and  funds  our  development  thereof  as  the  construction  agent  and
guarantor  we  subsequently  lease the property  from the lessor for an initial
term of  five  years  and  have  the  option  to  request  up to two  additional
successive  renewal  periods of five years each from the  lessor  although  the
lessor is not obligated to grant us either renewal period the facility provides
for a residual value  guarantee of  approximately  366 million at december 31
2001 and purchase  options on the properties  it also contains a provision for
an event of default  whereby the lessor  among other things  may require us to
purchase any or all of the properties  we are utilizing the facility to finance
a portion of our store growth  funding under the facility at december 31 2001
and 2000 totaled 430 million and 10 million respectively

     on december 29 2000 we completed a saleleaseback transaction  under the
terms of the transaction  we sold 90 properties  including land buildings and
improvements  for 523 million  the lease which is being accounted for as an
operating  lease  provides  for an  initial  lease  term of 21 years and may be
extended for one tenyear period and two additional  successive  periods of five
years each  the  resulting  gain of 45 million has been deferred and is being
amortized  over the initial lease term net rent expense during the initial term
is  approximately  55 million  annually and is included in the table of future
minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases proceeds
from the  transaction  were  used to  reduce  outstanding  borrowings  under our
revolving credit facility

     in  august   2001   the   company   completed   a   saleleaseback   with
oreillywooten  2000  llc an  entity  owned  by  certain  shareholders  of the
company  the transaction closed on september 1 2001 with a purchase price of
approximately  56  million  for nine  oreilly  auto parts  stores and did not
result in a material gain or loss the lease which has been accounted for as an
operating  lease  calls for an initial  term of 15 years  with three  fiveyear
renewal options

     capital  expenditures were 685 million in 2001 820 million in 2000 and
860 million in 1999 these  expenditures were primarily related to the opening
of new stores  as well as the relocation or remodeling of existing  stores  we
opened 121 101 and 80 net stores in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively  we also
acquired  82 stores in  connection  with the  purchase of  midstate  effective
october 1 2001  we  remodeled  or  relocated 16 stores in 2001 and 8 stores in
both 2000 and in 1999  four new  distribution  centers  were  acquired  two in
october 2001 located in nashville  tennessee and knoxville  tennessee one in
october 2000 located in little rock arkansas  and the other in december 1999
located in dallas texas

     our  continuing  store  expansion  program  requires   significant  capital
expenditures  and working capital  principally for inventory  requirements  the
costs  associated  with the opening of a new store  including  the cost of land
acquisition  improvements  fixtures  inventory  and computer  equipment  are
estimated to average approximately 900000 to 11 million however such costs
may be  significantly  reduced where we lease  rather than purchase  the store
site  although the cost to acquire the business of an independently owned parts
store varies  depending  primarily upon the amount of inventory and the amount
if any of real estate  being  acquired  we estimate  that the average  cost to
acquire  such a business  and  convert it to one of our stores is  approximately
400000  we plan to finance our expansion  program through cash expected to be
provided from operating  activities and available  borrowings under our existing
credit facilities

     on november 4 1999  the board of directors  declared a twoforone  stock
split  effected  in the form of a 100 stock  dividend  to all  shareholders  of
record as of november  15  1999  the stock  dividend  was paid on november 30
1999

     in march 1999 we sold 7002000 shares of common stock through a secondary
public offering  the net proceeds from that offering  which amounted to 1246
million were used to repay a portion of our outstanding  indebtedness under our
bank credit facilities and to fund our expansion

     in order to fund the hilo  acquisition  our  continuing  store  expansion
program and our working  capital and general  corporate  needs  we replaced our
lines of credit in january 1998 with an unsecured  fiveyear  syndicated credit
facility of 175  million  the credit  facility  was reduced to 165 million in
1999 1525 million in 2000 and 140 million in 2001 the facility is currently
comprised of a revolving  credit facility of 125 million and a term loan of 15
million  the credit  facility  is  guaranteed  by all of our  subsidiaries  at
december 31 2001 and 2000 61350000 and 74755000  respectively  of the
revolving  credit facility and 15 million and 275 million  respectively  of
the term loan were  outstanding  the credit  facility  which bears interest at

     we believe that our existing cash shortterm investments cash expected to
be provided by operating activities  available bank credit facilities and trade
credit will be sufficient  to fund both our  shortterm  and  longterm  capital
needs for the foreseeable future

inflation and seasonality

     we succeeded  in many cases  in reducing the effects of merchandise  cost
increases   principally  by  taking  advantage  of  vendor  incentive  programs
economies of scale  resulting from  increased  volume of purchases and selective
forward  buying  as a result  we do not believe that our operations  have been
materially affected by inflation

     our business is somewhat  seasonal  primarily as a result of the impact of
weather  conditions  on store sales  store sales and profits have  historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  april through  september of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters

     the  blackscholes   option  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully  transferable  in addition  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility   because  the   companys   stock   options  have   characteristics
significantly  different from those of traded options and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate  in
managements opinion the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options

     for  purposes of pro forma  disclosures  the  estimated  fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period  the companys

parts people to undergo  extensive  and ongoing  training and to be  technically
knowledgeable particularly with respect to hard parts in order to better serve
the  technicallyoriented  professional  installers with whom they interact on a
daily basis  such technical  proficiency  also enhances the customer service we
provide to our diy customers  who appreciate the expert assistance  provided by
our professional parts people

      strategic   distribution   systems   we  believe   that  the   geographic
concentration of our store network in nine contiguous  states  missouri  iowa
nebraska  kansas  oklahoma  texas louisiana  arkansas and illinois and the
strategic  locations  of our seven  distribution  centers  enable us to maintain
optimum  inventory  levels  throughout  our  store  network  in  addition  our
inventory  management and distribution  systems  electronically link each of our
stores to a distribution  center  providing for efficient inventory control and
management our distribution system provides each of our stores with same day or
overnight  access to over 100000 skus many of which are hard to find items not
typically  stocked by other parts  retailers  we believe the  availability of a
broad range of products is a key  competitive  advantage in satisfying  customer
demand and generating repeat business

      experienced  management  team  our  management  team  has a  demonstrated
ability to successfully  execute our business plan including the identification
and integration of strategic acquisitions we have experienced eight consecutive
years of record revenues and earnings growth we have a strong senior management
team  comprised  of 40  professionals  who average 19 years of  experience  with
oreilly  in  addition  our 70  district  managers  average  over 10  years of
experience with us

growth and expansion strategies

      aggressively  open new stores  we intend to continue to aggressively open
new stores in order to achieve  greater  penetration in existing  markets and to
expand into new contiguous markets we plan to open approximately 120 stores in
2001 and  approximately  145 stores in 2002  all of the sites for our  proposed
2001 store  openings  and a majority  of the sites for our  proposed  2002 store
openings have been  identified  in selecting  sites for new stores  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve  economies  of  scale  in  areas  such as  management  advertising  and
distribution

     until 1986 our expansion was targeted to markets with  populations of less
than  100000  we entered into a more densely  populated  market in august 1986
with the opening of the first of 29 stores in the greater kansas city missouri
market area  of the 101 net new stores opened in 2000 63 are located in texas
13 are located in iowa 3 in nebraska 8 in louisiana  10 in arkansas and 4 in
oklahoma  while we have faced  and expect to continue to face more aggressive
competition  in the more  densely  populated  markets  we believe  that we have
competed  effectively  and that we are well  positioned  to continue to compete
effectively  in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales and profit
growth  within  these  markets  we also believe that because of our dual market
strategy  we are better able to operate stores in less densely  populated areas
within our  regional  market  which  would not  otherwise  support a national or
regional  chain  store  selling  to one  portion  of the  market  or the  other
consequently we expect to continue to open new stores in less densely populated
market areas

     to date  we have  experienced  no  significant  difficulties  in  locating
suitable  store sites for  construction  of new stores or  identifying  suitable
acquisition  candidates for conversion to oreilly stores we typically open new
stores  either i by  constructing  a new store at a site which is purchased or
leased  and  stocking  the new store with  fixtures  and  inventory  or ii by
acquiring  an  independently  owned parts  store  typically  by the purchase of
substantially  all of the inventory and other assets other than realty of such
store  store  sites are  strategically  located in clusters  within  geographic
areas which complement our distribution system in order to achieve economies of
scale in management  advertising  and distribution costs other key factors we
consider in the site selection  process  include  population  density and growth
patterns age and per capita income vehicle traffic counts the number and type
of  existing  automotive  repair  facilities   auto  parts  stores  and  other
competitors within a predetermined radius and the operational strength of such
competitors  when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally
seek to initially  open several  stores  within a short span of time in order to
maximize  the  effect  of  initial  promotional  programs  and  achieve  further
economies of scale

     same store growth  through  increased  sales and  profitability  is also an
important  part  of  our  growth   strategy   to  achieve  improved  sales  and
profitability at existing oreilly stores we continually strive to improve upon
the service provided to our customers we believe that while competitive pricing
is  essential  in the  competitive  environment  of the  automotive  aftermarket
business   it  is  customer  satisfaction  whether  of  the  diy  consumer  or
professional installer resulting from superior customer service that generates
increased sales and profitability

      selectively  pursue  strategic   acquisitions   although  the  automotive
aftermarket  industry  is still  highly  fragmented  we believe  the ability of
national and regional specialty retail chains such as oreilly to operate more
efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result
in continued  industry  consolidation  thus  we intend to  selectively  pursue
acquisition  targets that will  strengthen our position as a leading  automotive
products retailer

      effective  january 31 1998 we acquired  hilo a specialty  retailer and
supplier of automotive  aftermarket  products  headquartered in houston  texas
following the acquisition  we sold seven hilo stores located in california of
the 182 stores  remaining  after such sale  165 are located in texas and 17 are
located in louisiana  through the hilo acquisition we also acquired a 425000
square foot  distribution  center located in houston  the hilo  operations are
contiguous  to our other  operations  thereby  creating  a  natural  geographic
extension  of our  business  in  addition  hilo was  experienced  in  serving
professional  installers  deriving  approximately 35 of its revenues from such
customers  we acquired hilo for a cash purchase price of  approximately  493
million  at the time of the  acquisition  hilo had 432  million of existing
debt which we assumed

      we have continued to realize the benefits of the completed  integration of
the 182 net stores we acquired through the acquisition of hilo we have updated
the products  offered at the former  hilo stores with a product mix  consistent
with our existing stores  converted these stores to our management  information
systems  and in some cases  renovated or  relocated  the former hilo  stores
furthermore  we  intend to  continue  to pursue  business  in the  professional
installer  market and benefit from increased  leverage in purchasing and reduced
overhead expenses

      continually enhance store design and location our current prototype store
design features  enhancements  such as greater square footage  higher ceilings
more convenient  interior store layouts  brighter  lighting  increased parking
availability  and  dedicated  counters to serve  professional  installers  each
designed  to  increase  product  sales and  operating  efficiencies  and enhance
customer service  we continually update the location and condition of our store
network through  systematic  renovation and relocation of our existing stores to
conform  with our  prototype  store  design  we  believe  that our  ability  to
consistently  achieve  growth in same store  product sales is due in part to our
commitment to maintaining an attractive  store network  which is  strategically
located to best serve our customers


products and purchasing

      our stores offer diy and professional installer customers a wide selection
of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported  automobiles
vans  and  trucks  we do not  sell  tires  or  perform  automotive  repairs  or
installations  our  merchandise  generally  consists of nationally  recognized
welladvertised  name brand  products  such as ac delco  moog  wagner  gates
rubber  federal  mogul  monroe  prestone  quaker state  pennzoil  castrol
valvoline stp bwd cardone wix armor all and turtle wax in addition to name
brand products  our stores carry a wide variety of  highquality  private label
products  under the parts  masterr  name brand and our oreilly auto partsr
superstartr brakebestr ultimar and omnisparkr proprietary name brands
because most of our private label products are produced by nationally recognized
manufacturers in accordance with our specifications we believe that the private
label  products are  generally of equal or in some cases  better  quality than
comparable  name brand  products  a  characteristic  which is  important to our
professional  installer  clientele  we further  believe that the private  label
products  are  packaged  attractively  to  promote  customer  interest  and  are
generally priced below comparable name brand products carried in our stores

         we purchase  automotive  products from  approximately 400 vendors  the
 five largest of which accounted for approximately 24 of our total purchases in
 2000 our largest vendor in 2000  accounted for  approximately  5 of our total
 purchases  and the next four largest  vendors each  accounted  for 45 of such
 purchases  we have no longterm  contractual  purchase commitments with any of
 our vendors  nor have we  experienced  difficulty  in  obtaining  satisfactory
 alternative sources of supply for automotive parts we believe that alternative
 supply sources exist at  substantially  similar costs  for  substantially  all
 automotive  products that we sell it is our policy to take  advantage of early
 payment  and  seasonal  purchasing  discounts  offered by our  vendors  and to
 utilize extended dating terms available from vendors due to volume  purchasing
 we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be good

store network

      store locations  as a result of our dual market strategy  we are able to
profitably  operate in both large  densely  populated  markets and less densely
populated  areas which would not otherwise  support a national or regional chain
selling to just one portion of the automotive  aftermarket  the following table
sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores

      our  stores  on  average  carry  approximately  23000  skus  and  average
approximately  6700 total square feet in size our stores are served  primarily
by the  nearest  distribution  center  but  also  have  access  to the  broader
selection of inventory available at one of our 43 master inventory stores which
on average  carry  approximately  37000  skus and average  approximately  8700
square feet in size  master  inventory  stores  in addition to serving diy and
professional  installer  customers  in their  markets  also  provides our other
stores  within  their area access to a greater  selection  of skus on a same day
basis

      we believe that our stores are destination  stores  generating their own
traffic  rather than relying on traffic  created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate  vicinity  consequently  most of our stores are  freestanding
buildings  situated  on or near major  traffic  thoroughfares  and offer  ample
parking and easy customer access

      store layout we utilize a computerassisted planogrammed store layout
system to provide a uniform and consistent  merchandise  presentation  however
some variation occurs in order to meet the specific needs of a particular market
area  merchandise  is  arranged  to provide  easy  customer  access and maximum
selling space keeping highturnover products and accessories within view of the
customer  aisle displays are generally used to feature  highdemand or seasonal
merchandise new items and advertised specials

      store automation  to enhance store level operations and customer service
we use ibm as400  computer  systems in all of our  stores  these  systems  are
linked  with  the ibm  as400  computers  located  in  each of our  distribution
centers  our pointofsale  terminals use bar code scanning technology to price
our  merchandise  and  provide  immediate  access to our  electronic  catalog to
display parts and pricing  information by make model and year of vehicle  this
system speeds  transaction  times  reduces register lines and provides enhanced
customer  service   moreover   our  store  automation  systems  capture  sales
information which assists in store  management  strategic  planning  inventory
control and distribution efficiency

      new store site selection  in selecting  sites for new stores  we seek to
strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to
achieve economies of scale in management  advertising and  distribution  other
key factors we consider in the site selection process include

o       population density and growth patterns
o       age and per capita income
o       vehicle traffic counts
o       the number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and
o       the  number  of  auto  parts   stores  and  other competitors  within  a
        predetermined radius and the operational strength of such competitors

      when entering new more densely  populated  markets  we generally seek to
initially  open several  stores within a short span of time in order to maximize
the effect of initial  promotional  programs  and achieve  further  economies of
scale  after  opening  this  initial  cluster of new  stores  we seek to begin
penetrating the less densely populated  surrounding areas this strategy enables
us to achieve  additional  distribution  and  advertising  efficiencies  in each
market

      in addition adjacent to the springfield  missouri  distribution center
we  operate  a  36000  square  foot  bulk  merchandise  warehouse  used for the
distribution  of  bulk  products  such  as  motor  oil  antifreeze  batteries
lubricants  and other fast  moving  bulk  products  and an 18000  square  foot
returned goods  processing  facility  we also operate a 22500 square foot bulk
warehouse in mcallen  texas that serves the surrounding  distribution  centers
with bulk motor oil

      our  distribution  centers are  equipped  with highly  automated  conveyor
systems  which  expedite  the  movement of our  products  to loading  areas for
shipment to  individual  stores on a nightly  basis  the  distribution  centers
utilize  computerassisted  technology  to  electronically  receive  orders from
computers  located in each of our  stores  in  addition  to the bar code system
employed in our stores we have established a  satellitebased  data interchange
system among those stores in which  highspeed data  transmission  technology is
not readily available  the distribution  center which services such stores and
our corporate headquarters

      we  believe  that our  distribution  system  assists  us in  lowering  our
inventorycarrying   costs   improving  our  store  instock   positions   and
controlling and managing our inventory  moreover we believe that our expanding
network of distribution  centers allows us to more efficiently  service existing
stores  as well as new stores  planned for opening in contiguous  market areas
our  distribution  center  expansion  strategy  also  complements  our new store
opening strategy by supporting newly  established  clusters of stores located in
the regions  surrounding  each  distribution  center  as part of our continuing
efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2001 we plan to

o       initiate full  utilization  of the  little  rock and dallas distribution
        centers to be served by all stores in those surrounding areas
o       implement improvement plans to increase inventory turnover in all dis
        tribution centers
o       finalize implementation of a new warehouse  management system in the des
        moines and oklahoma city  distribution centers which  will  enhance the
        efficiency of our distribution network


marketing

      marketing  to the diy  customer  we  aggressively  promote  sales  to diy
customers through an extensive  advertising program  which includes direct mail
and newspaper  radio and television advertising in selected markets we believe
that our  advertising  and  promotional  activities have resulted in significant
name recognition in each of our market areas newspaper and radio advertisements
are generally directed towards specific product and price promotions frequently
in connection with specific sale events and promotions  to promote sales to car
enthusiasts  who we believe on an  individual  basis  spend more on  automotive
products than the public generally  we sponsor seven nationally televised races
and  over 50  motorsports  races  and car  shows at over 65  racetracks  in nine
states  including the nascar allstar dirt series the oreilly chili bowl the
world of outlaws series  the nascar  craftsmen  truck series  as well as three
national hotrod racing  association  races in houston and dallas  we have found
that the more progressive  marketing concepts utilized in the diy portion of our
business  can also be applied to increase  sales to our  professional  installer
customers

professional parts people

      we  believe  our  highly  trained  team of  professional  parts  people is
essential in providing  superior service both to diy and professional  installer
customers  each of our professional  parts people is required to be technically
proficient in the workings and  application  of  automotive  products due to the
significant portion of our business  represented by the professional  installer
in addition  we have found that the typical diy customer often seeks assistance
from sales persons  particularly in connection with the purchase of hard parts
we believe  that the ability of our  professional  parts  people to provide such
assistance  to  the  diy  customer  creates  a  favorable  impression  during  a
customers visit to our store and is a significant  factor in generating  repeat
diy business

      we screen  prospective  employees  whom we refer to as team  members  to
identify highly motivated individuals either with experience in automotive parts
or repairs or an aptitude for automotive  knowledge  each person who becomes a
team member first  participates  in an  intensive  twoday  orientation  program
designed to  introduce  the team member to our culture and his or her job duties
before being assigned specific job  responsibilities  the successful completion
of additional training is required before a team member is deemed qualified as a
parts  specialist  and  thus  able to work at the  parts  counter  of one of our
stores all new counter people are required to successfully complete a sixmonth
basic  automotive  systems  training course and are then enrolled in a sixmonth
advanced  automotive  systems course for certification by the national institute
for automotive service excellence ase  which administers national exams for

call  training  for  business  development  after which these team members will
spend  one day per week  calling  on  existing  and new  professional  installer
customers  additionally each team member engaged in such sales activities will
participate  in  quarterly  advanced  training  programs  for sales and business
development


customer service

      we seek to provide our customers  with an efficient and pleasant  instore
experience by maintaining  attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide
selection of automotive  products  we believe that the  satisfaction of diy and
professional installer customers is substantially  dependent upon our ability to
provide  in a  timely  fashion  the  specific  automotive  product  requested
accordingly  each  oreilly  store  carries  a broad  selection  of  automotive
products  designed  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  vehicle  specifications   we
continuously  refine the inventory levels carried in our stores  based in large
part on the sales movement shown by our  computerized  inventory  control system
and on managements assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace

pricing

      we believe that a competitive  pricing policy is essential  within product
categories  in order to  compete  successfully  product  pricing  is  generally
established  to meet the  pricing  policies  of  competitors  in the market area
served  by each  store  most  automotive  products  that we sell are  priced at
discounts to the  manufacturer  suggested  prices  and  additional  savings are
offered through volume  discounts and special  promotional  pricing  consistent
with our low price guarantee each of our stores will match any verifiable price
on any instock product of the same or comparable  quality offered by any of our
competitors

competition

      we  compete in both the diy and  professional  installer  portions  of the
automotive aftermarket we compete primarily with

o       national and regional retail automotive  parts chains such as autozone
        inc advance auto parts and the pep boysmanny moe and jack inc

risk factors

      some of the  information in this form 10k contains and future reports and
press  releases  and  other  public  information  may  contain   forwardlooking
statements that involve  substantial risks and  uncertainties  you can identify
these  statements  by  forwardlooking  words such as may  will  expect
anticipate  believe  estimate  and continue or similar  words  these
forwardlooking   statements  are  made  in  reliance  upon  the  safe  harbor
provisions of the private securities  litigation reform act of 1995 see section
27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act
of 1934 you should read statements that contain these words carefully  because
they 1 discuss our future expectations 2 contain projections of our future
results  of  operations  or of  our  financial  condition  or 3  state  other
forwardlooking  information  we believe it is important to  communicate  our
expectations to our investors  however  there may be events in the future that
we are not able to accurately predict or over which we have no control the risk
factors listed in this section  as well as any cautionary language in this form
10k  provide  examples of risks  uncertainties  and events that may cause our
actual results to differ  materially  from the  expectations  we describe in our
forwardlooking  statements  you  should be aware  that the  occurrence  of the
events  described  in these risk  factors and  elsewhere in this form 10k could
have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial
condition

the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive

      both the diy and  professional  installer  portions  of our  business  are
highly  competitive  particularly  in the more densely  populated areas that we
serve some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial
resources  in addition some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall
but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market for a list of our
principal competitors see the businesscompetition section of item 1 of this
form 10k

we cannot assure future growth

      we believe that our ability to open  additional  stores at an  accelerated
rate will be a  significant  factor in achieving our growth  objectives  for the
future  failure to achieve  our growth  objectives  may  negatively  impact the
trading  price of our  common  stock  our  ability  to  accomplish  our  growth
objectives is dependent in part on matters beyond our control such as weather
conditions  zoning and other issues related to new store site development  the
availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic
conditions  we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2001 and beyond will be
achieved  for a discussion of our growth strategies  see the businessgrowth
and expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10k

acquisitions may not lead to expected growth

      we acquired  certain  assets of gateway auto supply in april 2000  karpro
auto parts in october 2000  and rankin  automotive  group in november  2000 we
expect to continue to make  acquisitions  as an element of our growth  strategy
acquisitions  involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth to differ
from  our  expectations  for  example  1 we may not be able to  continue  to
identify suitable  acquisition  candidates or to acquire additional companies at
favorable prices or on other favorable terms 2 our managements attention may
be  distracted  3 we may fail to retain key  acquired  personnel  4 we may
assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems and 5 we may not be
able to successfully integrate the operations accounting and billing functions
for example of businesses we acquire to realize economic operational and other
benefits

sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions

      all of our stores are located in the central and southern  united  states
in particular  approximately 40 of our stores are located in texas therefore
our  business is  sensitive  to the  economic  and weather  conditions  of these
regions   unusually  severe  or  inclement   weather  tends  to  reduce  sales
particularly to diy customers

dependence upon key and other personnel

      our  success  has been  largely  dependent  on the  efforts of certain key
personnel  including  david e  oreilly  lawrence  p  oreilly  charles  h
oreilly  jr rosalie oreilly  wooten  ted f wise and greg l henslee  our
business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the
loss of the  services  of one or more of these  individuals  additionally  our
successful  implementation and management of our growth and expansion strategies
will  depend  on our  ability  to  continue  to  attract  and  retain  qualified
personnel  we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue  to attract  such
personnel  for a further  discussion of our management  and personnel  see the
business  section  of item 1 and  item  4a of this  form  10k  and our  proxy
statement on schedule 14a for the 2001 annual meeting of shareholders a portion
of which is incorporated herein

significant voting control is held by the oreilly family

      as of the date of this form 10k the  oreilly  family  beneficially  owns
approximately  192 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result
the  oreilly  family  acting  together  will  continue  to be able to  exercise
significant  voting  control  over the  company  including  the election of our
directors and on any other matter being voted on by our shareholders  including
any merger sale of assets or other change in control

possible volatility of our stock price

      the stock  market  and the price of our  common  stock may be  subject  to
volatile  fluctuations  based on general  economic  and market  conditions  the
market  price for our common  stock may also be  affected by our ability to meet
analysts expectations  failure to meet such expectations even slightly could
have an adverse  effect on the market  price of our common  stock  in addition
stock market  volatility  has had a  significant  effect on the market prices of
securities  issued by many  companies  for reasons  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of these companies  in the past following periods of volatility in
the market price of a companys  securities  securities class action litigation
has often been  instituted  against such a company  if similar  litigation were
instituted  against us it could result in substantial  costs and a diversion of
our managements attention and resources  which could have an adverse effect on
our business


shares eligible for future sale

      all of the shares of common stock  currently held by our affiliates may be
sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act
of 1933 as amended  subject to certain volume and other conditions  imposed by
such rule we cannot predict the effect  if any that future sales of shares of
common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market
price of the common stock  prevailing  from time to time  sales of  substantial
amounts of common stock  or the perception  that such sales might occur  could
adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock

     party  subject to renewal  for three  fiveyear  terms at our  option  to
     facilitate  construction  we  loaned  to  the  owner  of the  facility  an
     aggregate of approximately 25 million the principal balance of such loan
     bears  interest  at a rate of 6 per annum  is  payable  in equal  monthly
     installments through january 2005 and is secured by a first deed of trust

      of the 672 stores that we operated at december 31  2000  225 stores were
owned  385 stores  were  leased  from  unaffiliated  parties and 62 stores were
leased  from  one of two  real  estate  investment  partnerships  and a  limited
liability  corporation  formed by the oreilly family  leases with unaffiliated
parties generally  provide for payment of a fixed base rent  payment of certain
tax  insurance  and  maintenance  expenses  and an original  term of 10 years
subject to one or more renewals at our option  the original  terms of 27 stores
leased  from  unaffiliated  parties  expire  prior to the end of  2001  we have
entered into separate  master lease  agreements with each of the affiliated real
estate investment  partnerships for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby
such master lease  agreements  expired on december  31  1998  and were renewed
through  december  31  2004  we  believe  that the lease  agreements  with the
affiliated real estate investment  partnerships are on terms comparable to those
obtainable from third parties

      we  believe  that  our  present  facilities  are in  good  condition  are
adequately insured and together with those under construction  are suitable and
adequate for the conduct of our current operations



item 3  legal proceedings

      we are  currently  involved in a lawsuit as a result of a complaint  filed
against  hilo in may 1997  the  plaintiff in this lawsuit  sought to certify a
class action on behalf of persons or entities in the states of texas  louisiana
and  california  that have  purchased a battery  from hilo since may 1990  the
complaint  alleges  that  hilo  offered  and  sold  old  used  and out of
warranty  batteries  as if the  batteries  were new  resulting  in claims  for
violations of deceptive trade practices breach of contract  negligence fraud
negligent misrepresentation and breach of warranty the plaintiff is seeking on
behalf of the class an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages

as well as  attorneys  fees and pre and  postjudgment  interest  on july 27
1998 the trial court  certified this class we appealed the decision to certify
the class in the court of appeals for the ninth  district of texas  on february
25 1999  the court of appeals  issued an opinion  affirming  the trial courts
decision to certify the class  at that time we appealed the opinion by seeking
a mandamus from the supreme court of texas  on april 6 1999 the supreme court
of texas asked the  plaintiff  to file a response  which was filed on april 14
1999 on may 3 1999 we filed a reply to that  response  on june 6 2000  the
supreme court of texas denied the appeal for a mandamus on january 15 2001 we
reached  a  favorable  verbal  settlement  with  the  plaintiffs  counsel  the
settlement  documents  are currently  being  prepared and will be subject to the
approval  of the trial  court  we  believe  that this  lawsuit  will not have a
material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated  financial  position  results of
operations or cash flows

      in addition  we and our  subsidiaries are involved in various other legal
proceedings  incidental  to the  conduct  of our  business  although  we cannot
ascertain the amount of liability  that we may incur from any of these  matters
we do not currently  believe that in the  aggregate  they will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or
cash flows

2000 compared to 1999

      product sales increased  1363  million  or 181 from 7541 million in
1999 to 8904 million in 2000  due to 101 net additional  stores opened during
2000  and a 280  million  or 40 increase in  samestore  product sales for
stores opened in both full periods  we believe that the increased product sales
achieved  by the  existing  stores are the result of our  offering  of a broader
selection of products in most stores  an increased  promotional and advertising
effort  through  a  variety  of media  and  localized  promotional  events  and
continued  improvement  in the  merchandising  and store layouts of most stores
also  our continued  focus on serving  professional  installers  contributed to
increased sales

      gross  profit  increased  176 from  3253  million or 431 of product
sales in 1999 to 3827 million or 430 of product sales in 2000

      operating  selling  general and administrative  expenses increased 443
million  from  2484  million  or  329 of  product  sales in 1999 to 2927
million or 329 of product  sales in 2000  the increase in these expenses in
dollar amount was  primarily  attributable  to increased  salaries and benefits
rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to
support the increased level of our operations

      other expense net increased by 30 million from 39 million in 1999 to
69  million in 2000  the increase was  primarily  due to interest  expense on
increased borrowings under our credit facility

      provision  for income taxes  increased  from 274  million in 1999 375
effective  tax rate to 315 million in 2000 378  effective  tax rate  the
increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to the increase of income before
income taxes  the nominal  increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due
to changes in the  apportionment  of sales  between  states with  differing  tax
rates

      principally  as a result of the  foregoing  net  income in 2000 was 517
million or 58 of product sales  an increase of 61 million or 133 from
net income in 1999 of 456 million or 61 of product sales


1999 compared to 1998

      product sales increased  1378  million  or 224 from 6163 million in
1998 to 7541 million in 1999  due to 80 net  additional  stores opened during
1999 and a 564  million  or 96 increase in samestore  product  sales  we
believe that the increased product sales achieved by the existing stores are the
result of our offering of a broader  selection  of products in most  stores  an
increased  promotional  and  advertising  effort  through a variety of media and
localized promotional events and continued improvement in the merchandising and
store layouts of most stores  also our continued focus on serving professional
installers contributed to increased sales

      gross  profit  increased  262 from  2579  million or 418 of product
sales  in 1998 to  3253  million  or 431 of  product  sales in 1999  the
increase in gross profit  margin was  primarily  attributable  to the  continued
improvements in our product  acquisition  programs and improved buying power due
to the number of net new stores opened in 1999

      operating  selling  general and administrative  expenses increased 474
million  from  2010  million  or  326 of  product  sales in 1998 to 2484
million or 329 of product  sales in 1999  the increase in these expenses in
dollar amount and as a percentage of sales primarily  resulted from higher costs
for  employee  medical  and  workers  compensation   benefits   the  continued
conversion of hilo automotive  inc hilo stores and distribution  center
as well as the addition of employees  and  facilities  to support the  increased
level of our operations

      other expense net decreased by 31 million from 70 million in 1998 to
39 million in 1999 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest
expense as a result of repayments of  indebtedness  under our syndicated  credit
facility with a portion of the net proceeds of our secondary offering

      our  provision  for  income  taxes was 375 and 384  respectively  of
income before  income taxes in 1999 and 1998  the decrease in the effective tax
rate primarily  related to a higher  percentage of our sales occurring in states
with lower income tax rates

      principally  as a result of the  foregoing  net  income in 1999 was 456
million or 61 of product sales an increase of 149 million or 483 from
net income in 1998 of 308 million or 50 of product sales


liquidity and capital resources

      net cash  provided by  operating  activities  was 58 million in 2000 and
297 million in 1999  net cash used in operating  activities was 191 million
in 1998 the decrease in cash provided by operating  activities in 2000 compared
to 1999 is the  result  of an  increase  in  inventory  and to a lesser  extent
increases in accounts receivable and amounts receivable from vendors  partially
offset by increases in net income  accounts  payable and accrued  payroll  the
increase in net cash  provided by operating  activities in 1999 compared to 1998
is the  result of  increases  in net  income  accrued  payroll  other  current
liabilities  and a larger tax benefit  resulting  from stock  option  exercises
offset by increases in amounts receivable from vendors and inventory

      net cash used in investing  activities  was 405  million in 2000  778
million in 1999 and 1008  million in 1998  the  decrease in cash used in 2000
was  primarily  due  to  the  sale  of  90  properties  for  52  million  in  a
saleleaseback  transaction  the  decrease  in cash used in 1999 was due to the
hilo  acquisition  in 1998  and an  increase  in  payments  received  on  notes
receivable  partially offset by increased  purchases of property and equipment
the increase in cash used in 1998 was primarily due to the purchase of hilo and
increased capital expenditures

      on december 29 2000 we completed a saleleaseback transaction under the
terms of the transaction  we sold 90 properties  including land buildings and
improvements  for 523 million  the lease which is being accounted for as an
operating  lease  provides  for an  initial  lease  term of 21 years and may be
extended for one initial tenyear period and two additional  successive  periods
of five years each  the resulting gain of 45 million has been deferred and is
being amortized over the initial lease term net rent expense during the initial
term will be approximately 55 million annually and is included in the table of
future minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable  operating leases
proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce  outstanding  borrowings under
our revolving credit facility

      capital expenditures were 820 million in 2000 860 million in 1999 and
577 million in 1998 these  expenditures were primarily related to the opening
of new stores  as well as the relocation or remodeling of existing  stores  we
opened  101  80 and 50 net  stores  in 2000  1999 and 1998  respectively  we
remodeled or relocated 8 stores in both 2000 and in 1999 and 18 stores in 1998
two new  distribution  centers were  acquired  one in october 2000  located in
little rock arkansas and the other in december 1999 located in dallas texas

      on december 15 2000  we entered into a 50 million  synthetic  operating
lease  facility  synthetic  facility  or  the  facility  with a  group  of
financial  institutions  under the  facility  the lessor  acquires  land to be
developed  for oreilly auto parts stores and funds our  development  thereof as
the construction  agent and guarantor  we subsequently  lease the property from
the  lessor for an initial  term of five  years with two  additional  successive
renewal  periods of five years each the facility  provides for a residual value
guarantee and purchase  options on the properties  it also contains a provision
for an event of default whereby the lessor  among other things  may require us
to purchase  any or all of the  properties  we plan to utilize the  facility to
finance a portion  of our  planned  store  growth  for 2001  funding  under the
facility at december 31 2000 totaled 10 million

      our  continuing  store  expansion  program  requires  significant  capital
expenditures  and working capital  principally for inventory  requirements  the
costs  associated  with the opening of a new store  including  the cost of land
acquisition  improvements  fixtures  inventory  and computer  equipment  are
estimated to average approximately 900000 to 11 million however such costs
may be  significantly  reduced where we lease  rather than purchase  the store
site  although the cost to acquire the business of an independently owned parts
store varies  depending  primarily upon the amount of inventory and the amount
if any of real estate  being  acquired  we estimate  that the average  cost to
acquire  such a business  and  convert it to one of our stores is  approximately
400000  we plan to finance our expansion  program through cash expected to be
provided from operating  activities and available  borrowings under our existing
credit facilities and the synthetic facility

      on november 4 1999 the board of directors  declared a twoforone  stock
split  effected  in the form of a 100 stock  dividend  to all  shareholders  of
record as of november  15  1999  the stock  dividend  was paid on november 30
1999

      in march  1999  we sold  7002000  shares  of  common  stock  through  a
secondary public offering  the net proceeds from that offering  which amounted
to 1246 million were used to repay a portion of our outstanding  indebtedness
under our bank credit facilities and to fund our expansion

      in order to fund the hilo  acquisition  our continuing  store  expansion
program  and our working capital and general  corporate  needs we replaced our
lines of credit in january 1998 with an unsecured  fiveyear  syndicated credit
facility totaling 175 million the facility was reduced to 165 million in 1999
and further  reduced to 1525  million in 2000  the facility is comprised of a
125 million  revolving loan a 5 million  sublimit for the issuance of letters
of credit and a 275 million term loan  this credit  facility is guaranteed by
our  subsidiaries  at december 31 2000  the  effective  interest  rate on the
revolving  and term loan  portions  which each mature on january 27 2003  was
70 per annum  at december 31 2000  502 in borrowings was available  under
this credit facility

      we believe that our existing cash shortterm  investments  cash expected
to be provided by operating  activities  available  bank credit  facilities and
trade credit will be sufficient  to fund both our short and  longterm  capital
needs for the foreseeable future

inflation and seasonality

      we succeeded  in many cases in reducing the effects of merchandise  cost
increases   principally  by  taking  advantage  of  vendor  incentive  programs
economies of scale  resulting from  increased  volume of purchases and selective
forward  buying  as a result  we do not believe that our operations  have been
materially affected by inflation

      our business is somewhat seasonal  primarily as a result of the impact of
weather  conditions  on store sales  store sales and profits have  historically
been higher in the second and third quarters  april through  september of each
year than in the first and fourth quarters

      pro forma  information  regarding  net  income and  earnings  per share is
required  by sfas  no  123  and has  been  determined  as if the  company  had
accounted  for its employee and  nonemployee  director  stock options under the
fair value method of that sfas

      the fair  values for these  options  were  estimated  at the date of grant
using a blackscholes  option pricing model with the following  weightedaverage
assumptions for 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively  riskfree interest rates of
502  654 and 474  volatility factors of the expected market price of the
companys  common stock of 442  247 and 221 and  weightedaverage  expected
life of the options of 89 80 and 80 years the company assumed a 0 dividend
yield over the expected life of the options the weightedaverage fair values of
options  granted during the years ended  december 31 2000  1999 and 1998 were
924  1022  and  644   respectively   the   weightedaverage   remaining
contractual  life at december 31 2000  for all  outstanding  options under the
companys stock option plans is 71 years the  weightedaverage  exercise price
for all outstanding options under the companys stock option plans was 1612 at
december 31 2000

      the  blackscholes  option  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully  transferable  in addition  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility   because  the   companys   stock   options  have   characteristics
significantly  different from those of traded options and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate  in
managements opinion the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options

      for purposes of pro forma  disclosures  the  estimated  fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period the effects of
applying  sfas  no  123  for  pro  forma  disclosures  are  not  likely  to  be
representative of the effects on reported net income or losses for future years
