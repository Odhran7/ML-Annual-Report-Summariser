business operational and strategic risks 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our longrange strategic operational and financial plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic operational and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans longrange strategic imperatives andor operational excellence priorities including continuous improvement project soar our replacement enterprise resource planning platform and supply chain optimization and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales may decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to

 

if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution centers could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 25000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire natural disasters or other catastrophic events labor disagreements inventory availability or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to 

receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and guests which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition shipping and transportation costs represent a component of our cost structure and an increase in shipping and transportation costs including as a result of inflationary pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our ecommerce platform exposes us to certain additional risks which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we offer most of our beauty products for sale through our ultacom website and through our mobile applications as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers supporting product offerings through these channels can create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce platform successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing guests rather than new guests who choose to purchase products from us online or through our mobile applications rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors additionally omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors as we continue to grow our ecommerce platform the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests conflicts between product offerings online or through our mobile applications and through our stores and opening up our channels to increased competition from pureplay ecommerce companies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant guestfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our ulta beauty branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions geopolitical events unanticipated political changes increased customs duties and legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products could result in substantial disruptions in our supply chain including inventory availability and materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced such as covid19 adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers may not be adequate to support our expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we currently operate four distribution centers which house the distribution operations for ulta beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce platform and two fast fulfillment centers ecommerce only in 2014 we began a multiyear supply chain project which focused on among other things adding capacity and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities to support our expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business it is likely additional distribution facilities will be added in the future our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance including

 ​ 

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock may decline 

we rely on our good relationships with brand partners to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain brand partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements with brand partners and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our brand partners our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our brand partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige brand partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing brand partners or if we fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional brand partners of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position

during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 merchandise supplied to ulta beauty by our top ten brand partners accounted for approximately 54 and 56 of our net sales respectively there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other brand partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased and mobile communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or source the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter instagram tiktok and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel at all levels such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store and distribution center associates competition for this type of personnel is intense especially in light of the labor pressures resulting from the covid19 pandemic and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably in addition fluctuations in the cost of labor including as a result of inflationary pressures on wages could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 10 billion secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in march 2025 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at either a base rate plus a margin of 0 to 0125 or the london interbank offered rate plus a margin of 1125 to 125 and the unused line fee is 020 per annum the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment

economic market and other external risks the health of the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions inflationary pressures levels of employment interest rates tax rates the availability of consumer credit consumer confidence in future economic conditions and risks related to epidemics or pandemics like covid19 and geopolitical events in the event of a prolonged period of inflation a prolonged economic downturn or an acute recession consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales

in addition a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our brand partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows additionally volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets may have a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in inflationary or recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth which in turn may lead to declines in consumer spending reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our business financial condition profitability cash flows and supply chain as well as consumer spending 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic resulted in federal state and local governments implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel restrictions border closings restrictions on public gatherings quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus shelterinplace restrictions and limitations or shutdowns of business operations in response to government recommendations and for the health and safety of our associates ie employees and guests on march 19 2020 we temporarily closed all stores across the us as a result of this decision we experienced a significant reduction in customer traffic and demand which resulted in our sales and results of operations being negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 while we have reopened all stores and resumed most of our instore services the potential temporary reclosing of certain stores in the future is possible covid19 could also negatively impact our future results of operations by weakening demand for our products and services andor by disrupting our supply chain the pandemic and its various impacts have also changed consumer behavior and consumption of beauty products due to the closures of offices retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in social gatherings 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our business financial condition profitability cash flows and supply chain although the full extent is still uncertain as the pandemic continues to evolve and new variants continue to emerge the extent of the impact on our business financial condition profitability cash flows and supply chain will depend on future developments including but not limited to the potential temporary reclosing of certain of our stores the potential temporary restrictions on certain of our stores operating hours andor in store capacity the duration of potential future quarantines shelterinplace and other travel restrictions within us and other affected countries the continued duration of the pandemic government actions to contain the virus andor treat its impact the duration timing and severity of the impact on consumer spending and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume all of which are still uncertain and cannot be predicted

epidemics pandemics like covid19 natural disasters or other catastrophes or crises that have and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

​ 

epidemics pandemics or other public health crises natural disasters such as hurricanes tornados wildfires earthquakes and mudslides as well as acts of violence or terrorism have resulted in the temporary closure of our stores and in the future could also result in physical damage to our properties the temporary reclosing of our stores the temporary closing of our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers the temporary lack of an adequate work force the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products or a substantial increase in the cost of those products from domestic or foreign suppliers the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods both to and from our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores andor the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers accordingly if one or more epidemics pandemics natural disasters andor acts of violence or terrorism were to occur as it is with the continuing covid19 pandemic it has and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to incur increased costs 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons online capabilities of national retailers pureplay ecommerce companies catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our guests’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn an outbreak of flu or other viruses such as covid19 a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we may respond by increasing markdowns initiating marketing 

promotions or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions inflationary pressures and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our stock repurchase programs could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

we may have in place from time to time a stock repurchase program any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions we may affect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness

climate change might adversely impact our business operations andor our supply chain 

​ 

scientific consensus shows that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns around the globe climatologists predict these changes will result in the increased frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters which could disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers these weather events could also lead to an increased rate of temporary store closures and reduced customer traffic at our stores in addition concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in new or additional legal legislative andor regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment any such new requirements could increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging as well as our product supply chain and distribution costs

​ 

there is also increased focus including by investors guests and other stakeholders on climate change and other environmental social governance esg and sustainability matters including single use plastic energy waste and worker safety

​ 

concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to change including moving away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact and towards products that are more sustainably made and we expect to incur additional costs in connection with our esg and sustainability initiatives

​ 

our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to act responsibly with respect to these matters and taken together these matters could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows as well as our ability to meet the needs of our customers

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points select beauty services and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment we define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category uses beauty for selfexpression experimentation and selfinvestment and has high expectations for the shopping experience we estimate that female beauty enthusiasts represent approximately 60 of shoppers and 75 of spend in the us beauty category we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance

today we are the largest beauty retailer in the united states and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics fragrance skin care products hair care products and salon services key aspects of our business include a differentiated assortment of more than 25000 beauty products across a variety of categories and price points as well as a variety of beauty services including salon services in more than 1300 stores predominantly located in convenient hightraffic locations engaging digital experiences delivered through our website ultacom and our mobile applications our bestinclass loyalty program that enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on products and beauty services and provides us with deep proprietary customer insights and our ability to cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic priorities 1 drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty 2 evolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems all in your world 3 expand and deepen our presence across the beauty journey solidifying ulta beauty at the heart of the beauty community 4 drive operational excellence and optimization 5 protect and cultivate our worldclass culture and talent and 6 expand our environmental and social impact we believe that the attractive and growing us beauty products and salon services industry the expanding definition of beauty and role that omnichannel capabilities play in consumers’ lives coupled with ulta beauty’s competitive strengths position us to capture additional market share in the industry

comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others

over the long term our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through growing our comparable sales expanding omnichannel capabilities and opening new stores longterm operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies partially offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a 1500 to 1700 store chain in the us with successful ecommerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities

current trends 

impact of covid19 

as previously discussed our results of operations for fiscal 2020 were significantly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic during fiscal 2021 we continued to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on all facets of our 

business as we navigated the impact of the pandemic we proactively took steps to optimize our cost structure while also investing in new capabilities to support future growth  

during fiscal 2021 we experienced an increase in sales driven primarily by the favorable impact from stronger consumer confidence government stimulus payments and the easing of covid19 restrictions while operations during fiscal 2021 did not appear to be as negatively impacted the continuing covid19 pandemic could have additional negative impacts in the future the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on future developments including but not limited to the potential temporary reclosing of certain stores the potential temporary restrictions on certain store operating hours andor instore capacity the duration of potential future quarantines shelterinplace and other travel restrictions within the us and other affected countries supply chain disruptions increased freight costs and higher wholesale costs the continued duration of the pandemic and any variants of the virus the duration timing and severity of the impact on consumer spending the timing and effectiveness of vaccine distribution vaccination rates and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

​ 

industry trend s 

​ 

our research indicates that ulta beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years however the covid19 pandemic and its various impacts have changed consumer behavior and consumption of beauty products due to the closures of offices retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in travel entertainment and social gatherings the overall beauty market declined in 2020 but stabilized in 2021 as consumers began to recover from the impacts of covid19 we remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model our commitment to strategic investments and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term

​ 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any future debt

basis of presentation 

​ 

the company has one reportable segment which includes retail stores salon services and ecommerce 

we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores ecommerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria retail store and ecommerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation accordingly we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup we provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase date state sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a passthrough conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales other revenue sources include the private label and cobranded credit card programs and royalties derived from the partnership with target as well as deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage

include retail sales and salon services including stores temporarily closed due to covid19 and ecommerce there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales

measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results

income tax expense of 553 million in fiscal 2020 represents an effective tax rate of 239 compared to fiscal 2019 income tax expense of 2002 million and an effective tax rate of 221 the higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less investment tax credits received and tax expense from the income tax accounting for stockbased compensation compared to a benefit in fiscal 2019

​

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories and cash and cash equivalents reduced by accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred revenue

our primary cash needs are for rent capital expenditures for new remodeled and relocated stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions supply chain improvements share repurchases and continued improvement in our information technology systems

our most significant ongoing shortterm cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations including expenditures for lease expenses inventory labor distribution advertising and marketing and tax liabilities as well as periodic spend for capital expenditures investments and share repurchases our working capital needs are greatest from august through november as a result of inventory buildup during this period for the holiday season 

longterm cash requirements primarily relate to funding lease expenses and other purchase commitments

we generally fund shortterm and longterm cash requirements with cash from operating activities we believe our primary sources of liquidity will satisfy our cash requirements over both the shortterm the next twelve months and longterm

the following table summarizes contractual cash requirements as of january 29 2022

​ 

 

 

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services the amount of purchase obligations relates to commitments for products and services and other goods and service contracts entered into as of january 29 2022 excluded from purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business 

cash flows 

we believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths that give us significant flexibility to meet our short and longterm financial commitments the following table presents a summary of our cash flows during the last three years

 operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash lease expense longlived asset impairment charges deferred income taxes stockbased compensation expense realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 is mainly due to the increase in net income and deferred revenue partially offset by higher merchandise inventories higher cash outflow from higher income taxes and lower longlived asset impairment charges compared to fiscal 2020 

the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales and a decrease in impairment restructuring and other costs partially offset by an increase in sga expenses and income taxes 

merchandise inventories net were 15 billion at january 29 2022 compared to 12 billion at january 30 2021 representing an increase of 3310 million or 283 the increase in total inventory was primarily driven by the addition of 44 net new stores opened since january 30 2021 inventory to support new brand launches and the acceleration of inventory receipts to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in net income merchandise inventories and the timing of accounts payable due to the covid19 pandemic 

​ 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new remodeled relocated and refreshed stores supply chain investments shortterm investments and investments in information technology systems

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to less proceeds of shortterm investments and more capital expenditures compared to fiscal 2020 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to less capital expenditures due to actions we took to preserve liquidity as we navigated through the covid19 pandemic and an increase in proceeds of shortterm investments offset by less purchases of shortterm investments

capital expenditures 

​ 

the following table presents a summary of our store activities during the last three years 

 ​ 

during fiscal 2021 the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store was approximately 14 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables 

capital expenditures during the last three years by major category are as follows

 ​ 

our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new remodeled and relocated stores information technology systems investments and supply chain investments that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures we expect fiscal 2022 capital expenditures will be 425 million and will be used to fund our new remodeled and relocated stores and strategic priorities including investments in information technology systems and supply chain optimization

financing activities 

financing activities primarily include share repurchases borrowing and repayment of our revolving credit facility and capital stock transactions purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases offset by an increase in stock option exercises and no activity under our revolving credit facility during fiscal 2021 

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to borrowing and repayment under our revolving credit facility and the suspension of the share repurchase program in order to strengthen our liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the covid19 pandemic 

we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at the end of fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including sales demand overall performance of management initiatives including expense control and inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods for unexpected business disruptions to support our new store program seasonal inventory needs or share repurchases 

share repurchase program 

in march 2019 the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the 2019 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to 8750 million of the company’s common stock the 2019 share repurchase program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amount of 254 million from the earlier share repurchase program the 2019 share repurchase program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time

in march 2020 the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the 2020 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to 16 billion of the company’s common stock the 2020 share repurchase program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amount of 1778 million from the 2019 share repurchase program the 2020 share repurchase program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time 

a summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table

as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the loan agreement

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mother’s day and valentine’s day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market net realizable value cost is determined using the moving average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the inventory reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 an increase or decrease in the lower of cost or market net realizable value reserve of 10 would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2021 an increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10 would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2021

vendor allowances 

the majority of cash consideration received from a vendor is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors’ products we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in receivables we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory an increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2021

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable assets are primarily reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term an impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying amount of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges during fiscal 2020 we recognized 725 million of impairment of longlived tangible and rightofuse assets which consisted of 419 million due to impairment analysis which indicated that the carrying values of certain longlived assets exceeded their respective fair values 196 million related to the suspension of the planned expansion to canada and 110 million related to the permanent closure of 19 stores no significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2019

loyalty program 

we maintain a customer loyalty program ultamate rewards which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise or services points earned are valid for at least one year the loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be redeemed on future products and services revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when the members redeem points or points expire we defer revenue related to points earned that have not yet been redeemed the amount of deferred revenue includes estimates for the standalone selling price of points earned by members and the percentage of points expected to be redeemed the expected redemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the estimated redemption rate 

adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 an increase or decrease in the estimated redemption rate of 5 would not have a material impact on our operating income in fiscal 2021 ​ 

income taxes 

​ 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws

​ 

we recognize deferred income taxes for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period of enactment a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized in full the estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is 

recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from applicable taxing authorities 

​ 

judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

our strategy 

we target beauty enthusiasts across multiple demographics and shopping behaviors beauty enthusiasts have a deep emotional connection with beauty and historically this connection has not diminished in softer economic environments our proprietary consumer research confirms engagement with the beauty category remains strong but the unprecedented challenges faced as a result of the covid19 pandemic will likely have sustained effects on the category health and safety concerns are elevated consumers have quickly adopted new shopping behaviors operating costs are increasing and many retailers have faced financial challenges resulting in increased store closures

recognizing the impact these changes will have on the beauty category we intend to leverage the strengths of our operating model and investments to position ulta beauty for continued success postcovid specifically we are focused on accelerating efforts in the following key areas to expand our longterm market share gains and extend our competitive advantages

our market 

we operate within the large us beauty products and salon services industry in 2020 this market represented approximately 150 billion in sales according to forecasted euromonitor international and ibis world inc in 2020 the beauty products industry totaled approximately 92 billion and included cosmetics haircare fragrance bath and body skincare salon styling tools and other toiletries we estimate that ulta beauty had only a 7 share of the 92 billion beauty product industry within this market we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige mass and salon products our assortment strategy is built to maximize our opportunity in this industry in 2020 the salon services industry totaled approximately 58 billion and included hair skin and nail services we estimate that ulta beauty had less than 1 share of this industry we have fullservice hair salons and skin services in substantially every store and operate brow bars in most of our stores as well as makeup services through our salons due to covid19 related restrictions we were unable to offer skin and makeup services for most of fiscal 2020 we have plans to resume services as soon as it is safe to do so 

although our business was impacted by temporary store closures due to covid19 our research indicates that ulta beauty continues to increase market share across most prestige beauty categories in the overall us market covid19 and its various impacts have changed consumer behavior and consumption of beauty products due to the closures of offices retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in social gatherings in addition beauty cycles are impacted by demographics trends and product innovation while demographic trends continue to be favorable we believe a lack of incremental product innovation has resulted in a challenging cycle for the cosmetics category as innovation brought to the market has not resulted in incremental product purchases despite the overall beauty market decline in 2020 due to covid19 impacts we expect the beauty category will return to growth as consumers recover from the impacts of covid19 and we remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model our commitment to strategic investments and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains for ulta beauty

competition 

our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores specialty stores drug stores mass merchandisers and the online capabilities of national retailers and brands as well as pureplay ecommerce companies the market for salon services and products is highly fragmented our competitors for salon services and products include chain and independent salons

our retail channels

​ 

 ​ 

our real estate vision is to make ulta beauty accessible and convenient to more consumers across a variety of markets a key driver of how we plan to expand our market share over time we believe that over the long term we have the potential to grow our store footprint to between 1500 to 1700 ulta beauty stores in the united states we plan to further penetrate existing suburban markets expand our presence in small markets and further develop urban markets 

our rigorous analytical approach to site selection has translated into a high performing real estate portfolio the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store is approximately 14 million which includes capital investments net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors including geographic location

diversity and inclusion 

our goal is to create an inclusive environment where every associate feels he or she can be his or her authentic self and every guest is optimally served regardless of differences  a critical way we achieve this is by educating all associates on the lived experiences of their peers and key moments in time that have cultural or heritage significance as well as the unconscious beliefs and biases that shape our behavior today we accomplish this through open discussion forums interactive educational experiences and opportunities to engage with our communities

in addition we aim to ensure that all instore experiences are equitable fair and unbiased we take action to support this goal by conducting mandatory trainings for instore associates and providing weekly learning opportunities to focus on guest perspectives and reinforce key takeaways we offer similar training across the organization to help key decisionmakers and associates in their own learning journeys and support our champion diversity value and inclusion competency

in addition we believe wellness like beauty is more than skin deep so we offer mental health resources such as counseling services and access to apps financial wellness planning and guidance and health apps and educational resources for soontobe parents

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mother’s day and valentine’s day

 item 1a risk factor s 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or future growth we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the united states as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment in our common stock 

business operational and strategic risks 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our longrange strategic and financial plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans or longrange strategic imperatives including our efficiencies for growth cost optimization program and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales may decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to

 

if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance including

 ​ 

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock may decline 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution centers could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 25000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as covid19 labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and guests which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition shipping and transportation costs represent a component of our cost structure and an increase in shipping and transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our ecommerce platform exposes us to certain additional risks which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we offer most of our beauty products for sale through our ultacom website and through our mobile applications as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers supporting product offerings through these channels can create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce platform successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing guests rather than new guests who choose to purchase products from us online or through our 

mobile applications rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors additionally omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors as we continue to grow our ecommerce platform the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests conflicts between product offerings online or through our mobile applications and through our stores and opening up our channels to increased competition from pureplay ecommerce companies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant guestfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our ulta beauty branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced such as covid19 adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers may not be adequate to support our historical growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we currently operate four distribution centers which house the distribution operations for ulta beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce platform and two fast fulfillment centers ecommerce 

only in 2014 we began a multiyear supply chain project which focused on among other things adding capacity and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities to support our historical and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business it is likely additional distribution centers or fast fulfillment centers will be added in the future our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

we rely on our good relationships with brand partners to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain brand partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements with brand partners and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our brand partners our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our brand partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige brand partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing brand partners or if we fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional brand partners of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position

during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 merchandise supplied to ulta beauty by our top ten brand partners accounted for approximately 56 and 61 of our net sales respectively there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other brand partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased and mobile communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or source the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter instagram and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising 

personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 10 billion secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in march 2025 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at either a base rate plus a margin of 0 to 0125 or the london interbank offered rate plus a margin of 1125 to 125 and the unused line fee is 020 per annum the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment

economic market and other external risks the covid19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our business financial condition profitability cash flows and supply chain as well as consumer spending 

​ 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic federal state and local governments have since implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel restrictions border closings restrictions on public gatherings quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus shelterinplace restrictions and limitations or shutdowns of business operations in response to government recommendations and for the health and safety of our associates ie employees and guests on march 19 2020 we temporarily closed all stores across the us as a result of this decision we experienced a significant reduction in customer traffic and demand which resulted in our sales and results of operations being negatively impacted while we have reopened all stores the potential temporary reclosing of certain stores in the future is possible covid19 could also negatively impact our future results of operations by continuing to weaken demand for our products and services andor by disrupting our supply chain 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that may continue the pandemic has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which may adversely affect our and our suppliers’ liquidity

the covid19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our business financial condition profitability cash flows and supply chain although the full extent is still uncertain as the pandemic continues to evolve the extent of the impact on our business financial condition profitability cash flows and supply chain will depend on future developments including but not limited to the potential temporary reclosing of certain of our stores the potential temporary restrictions on certain of our stores operating hours andor in store capacity the duration of potential future quarantines shelterinplace and other travel restrictions within us and other affected countries the duration of the pandemic including any continuing relapses the actions to contain the virus andor treat its impact the duration timing and severity of the impact on consumer spending and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted

epidemics pandemics like covid19 natural disasters or other catastrophes or crises that have and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

​ 

epidemics pandemics or other public health crises natural disasters such as hurricanes tornados wildfires earthquakes and mudslides as well as acts of violence or terrorism have resulted in the temporary closure of our stores and in the future could also result in physical damage to our properties the temporary reclosing of our stores the temporary closing of our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers the temporary lack of an adequate work force 

the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products or a substantial increase in the cost of those products from domestic or foreign suppliers the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods both to and from our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores andor the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers accordingly if one or more epidemics pandemics natural disasters andor acts of violence or terrorism were to occur as it is with the covid19 pandemic it has and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to incur increased costs 

the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates tax rates the availability of consumer credit consumer confidence in future economic conditions and risks related to epidemics or pandemics like covid19 in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or acute recession consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales

in addition a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our brand partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows additionally volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets may have a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth which in turn may lead to declines in consumer spending reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons online capabilities of national retailers pureplay ecommerce companies catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our guests’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a 

consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn an outbreak of flu or other viruses such as covid19 a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we may respond by increasing markdowns initiating marketing promotions or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our stock repurchase programs could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

we may have in place from time to time a stock repurchase program any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions we may affect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness

regulatory legal and cybersecurity risks 

​ 

cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest employee company andor business partners’ information damage our reputation and expose us to liability which could negatively impact our business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect process and store sensitive and confidential data including our proprietary business information and that of our guests suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches attacks by hackers acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events furthermore we allow certain of our employees to work from home as a result of the covid19 pandemic as certain of our thirdparty service providers also allow and this remote working environment may increase cybersecurity related risks any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points a compelling value proposition and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment we define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category and has high expectations for the shopping experience we estimate that beauty enthusiasts represent approximately 57 of shoppers and 77 of spend in the us beauty category we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance

we are the largest beauty retailer in the united states and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics fragrance skin care products hair care products and salon services we provide unmatched product breadth value and convenience in a distinctive specialty retail environment key aspects of our business include our ability to offer our guests a unique combination of more than 25000 beauty products from across the categories of prestige and mass cosmetics fragrance haircare prestige and mass skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as a fullservice salon in every store featuring hair skin and brow services our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories and convenience as our stores are predominantly located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic priorities 1 build omnichannel operations that more deeply connects guests across channels 2 reimagine how guests experience and discover beauty 3 drive market share growth through the deployment of winning category strategies 4 deepen ulta beauty love and loyalty 5 drive holistic cost optimization and 6 develop our talent and strengthen our culture we believe that the expanding us beauty products and salon services 

industry the shift in distribution channel of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta beauty’s competitive strengths position us to capture additional market share in the industry

comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others

over the long term our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable sales opening new stores and increasing omnichannel capabilities longterm operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a 1500 to 1700 store chain in the us with successful ecommerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities

covid19 response 

we have been and continue to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 outbreak on all facets of our business we have taken decisive actions to protect the safety of our associates and guests and to manage the business throughout the fluid and challenging environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic

in late 2019 covid19 was detected in wuhan china and other jurisdictions prompting the chinese government to quarantine certain affected regions and impose both internal and external travel restrictions within the country the virus has since spread to every other part of the world including the us and in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic federal state and local governments have since implemented various restrictions including travel restrictions border closings restrictions on public gatherings quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus shelterinplace restrictions and limitations on business operations

in response to government recommendations and for the health and safety of our associates and guests on march 19 2020 we temporarily closed all stores across the us while continuing to support our essential ecommerce operations effective april 19 2020 we temporarily furloughed many of our store and salon associates in april 2020 we introduced curbside pickup and in may 2020 we began reopening stores throughout the second quarter stores were reopened on a phased timeline by taking a thoughtful measured approach based on a variety of criteria including state and local guidelines and the adoption of our new shop safe standards as of july 20 2020 we completed our phased reopening process by october 31 2020 salon and brow services had resumed in almost all stores due to covid19 restrictions we have not resumed skin and makeup services but we have plans to resume skin and makeup services as soon as it is safe to do so 

our results of operations for the fiscal year ended january 30 2021 were significantly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic comparable sales decreased 179 for the fiscal year ended january 30 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic but the multiyear strategic investments we have made to enhance our omnichannel and supply chain capabilities combined with the ongoing commitment of our distribution associates have enabled us to support increased ecommerce demand and strong guest engagement in addition to decreases in net revenue our overall profitability also decreased as compared to the prior year these developments have further required us to recognize certain longlived asset impairment charges and restructuring charges further in connection with the coronavirus aid 

relief and economic security cares act we recognized payroll subsidies as a reduction of selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations

as we navigated these unprecedented circumstances we continued to focus on our financial flexibility including drawing down 8000 million under our 10 billion revolving credit facility on march 18 2020 which was repaid in full on september 2 2020 in addition we took the following steps to preserve financial liquidity

 

to help support our associates through this crisis we expanded the criteria for our associate relief program to include those who need assistance due to a personal hardship as a result of the covid19 pandemic the ulta beauty executive team and board of directors have each made personal donations to the program

​ 

sales are expected to be challenged as events continue to change and we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our results of operations due to uncertainties including but not limited to the potential temporary reclosing of certain of our stores the potential temporary restrictions on certain store operating hours andor instore capacity the duration of potential future quarantines shelterinplace and other travel restrictions within the us and other affected countries the duration of the pandemic and any more dangerous variants of the virus the duration timing and severity of the impact on consumer spending the timing and effectiveness of vaccine distribution and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

​ 

industry trends 

​ 

our research indicates that ulta beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years however our research also suggests that the cosmetics category in the overall us market experienced midsingle digit declines through fiscal 2019 and 2020 beauty cycles are impacted by demographics and innovation while demographic trends continue to be favorable we believe a lack of incremental innovation has resulted in a challenging cycle for the cosmetics category as innovation brought to the market has not resulted in incremental product purchases in addition the covid19 pandemic and its various impacts have changed consumer behavior and consumption of beauty products due to the closures of offices retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in social gatherings we expect the beauty category will return to growth as consumers recover from the impacts of covid19 and we remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model our commitment to strategic investments and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term 

​ 

basis of presentation 

​ 

the company has one reportable segment which includes retail stores salon services and ecommerce 

we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores ecommerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria retail store and ecommerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation accordingly we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup we provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase date however due to store closures during the first half of fiscal 2020 we extended our return policy to 180 days through november 16 2020 state sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a passthrough conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a 

reduction of net sales other revenue sources include the private label and cobranded credit card programs as well as deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage

sga expenses increased 02 billion or 147 to 18 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to 15 billion in fiscal 2018 as a percentage of net sales sga expenses increased 90 basis points to 238 in fiscal 2019 compared to 229 in fiscal 2018 the deleverage in sga expenses was primarily due to

 ​ 

preopening expenses 

preopening expenses decreased 05 million or 26 to 193 million in fiscal 2019 compared to 198 million in fiscal 2018 during fiscal 2019 we opened 86 new stores remodeled 12 stores and relocated eight stores during fiscal 2018 we opened 107 new stores remodeled 13 stores and relocated two stores

interest income net 

interest income net was 51 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 interest income results from cash equivalents and shortterm investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase interest expense represents interest on borrowings and fees related to the credit facility we did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 2002 million in fiscal 2019 represents an effective tax rate of 221 compared to fiscal 2018 income tax expense of 2006 million and an effective tax rate of 233 the lower tax rate is primarily due to income tax accounting for stockbased compensation and federal income tax credits

net income 

net income increased 474 million or 72 to 7059 million in fiscal 2019 compared to 6586 million in fiscal 2018 the increase in net income was primarily due to a 2718 million increase in gross profit partially offset by a 2253 million increase in sga expenses

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for rent capital expenditures for new remodeled and relocated stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions supply chain improvements share repurchases and continued improvement in our information technology systems

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories and cash and cash equivalents reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018

 operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash lease expense longlived asset impairment charge deferred income taxes stockbased compensation expense realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes the fiscal 2020 decrease over fiscal 2019 is mainly due to the decrease in net income merchandise inventories and the timing of accounts payable the decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit resulting from lower sales as a result of the covid19 pandemic and an increase in impairment restructuring and other costs partially offset by a decrease in sga expenses and income taxes 

merchandise inventories net were 12 billion at january 30 2021 compared to 13 billion at february 1 2020 representing a decrease of 1255 million or 97 the decrease in total inventory was primarily driven by reduced store inventory due to a decline in store traffic trends partially offset by an increase due to 10 net new stores opened since february 1 2020 and the opening of our jacksonville fast fulfillment center

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new remodeled relocated and refreshed stores supply chain investments shortterm investments and investments in information technology systems investment activities for capital expenditures were 1519 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 2985 million and 3194 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively capital expenditures decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to actions we took to preserve liquidity as we navigated through the covid19 pandemic proceeds of shortterm investments were 1100 million during fiscal 2020 and consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of three to twelve months from the date of purchase during fiscal 2020 we contributed 57 million to equity method investments 

the following table presents a summary of our store activities in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 

 ​ 

during fiscal 2020 the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store was approximately 14 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 by major category are as follows

 ​ 

our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new remodeled and relocated stores information technology systems and supply chain investments that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 consist principally of borrowing and repayment of our revolving credit facility share repurchases and capital stock transactions purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic we drew down 8000 million of our 10 billion revolving credit facility and suspended our share repurchase program we repaid the 8000 million of borrowings on september 2 2020 and resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter the zero outstanding borrowings position continues to be due to a combination of factors including an improvement in sales trends in the second half of the year overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods for unexpected business disruptions to support our new store program share repurchases and seasonal inventory needs

credit facility 

on march 11 2020 we entered into amendment no 1 to the second amended and restated loan agreement as so amended the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo bank national association and jpmorgan chase bank na as lead arrangers and bookrunners jpmorgan chase bank na as syndication agent and a lender pnc bank national association as documentation agent and a lender and the other lenders party thereto the loan agreement matures on march 11 2025 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 10 billion or a percentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables which borrowing base may at the election of the company and satisfaction of certain conditions include a percentage of qualified cash contains a 500 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 1000 million subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 10 to 10 during such periods when availability under the loan agreement falls below a specified threshold substantially all of the company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the loan agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the company’s election at either a base rate plus a margin of 0 to 0125 or the london interbank offered rate plus a margin of 1125 to 1250 with such margins based on the company’s borrowing availability and the unused line fee is 020 per annum

as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the loan agreement

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mother’s day and valentine’s day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and sga expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any future debt

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 30 2021 we have not entered into any “offbalance sheet” arrangements as that term is described by the sec we do however have offbalance sheet purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business as indicated within the contractual obligations table below

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of january 30 2021

 

  

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services excluded from our purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business the amount of purchase obligations relates to commitments made to thirdparties for products and services and other goods and service contracts entered into as of january 30 2021

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market net realizable value cost is determined using the moving average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or 

disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the inventory reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 an increase or decrease in the lower of cost or market net realizable value reserve of 10 would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2020 an increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10 would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2020

vendor allowances 

the majority of cash consideration received from a vendor is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors’ products we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in receivables we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory an increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2020

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable assets are primarily reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term an impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying amount of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges during fiscal 2020 we recognized 725 million of impairment of longlived tangible and rightofuse assets which consisted of 419 million due to impairment analysis which indicated that the carrying values of certain longlived assets exceeded their respective fair values 196 million related to the suspension of the planned expansion to canada and 110 million related to the permanent closure of 19 stores no significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018

loyalty program 

we maintain a customer loyalty program ultamate rewards which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise or services points earned are valid for at least one year the loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be redeemed on future products and services revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when the members redeem points or points expire we defer revenue related to points earned that have not yet been redeemed the amount of deferred revenue includes estimates for the standalone selling price of points earned by members and the percentage of points expected to be redeemed the expected redemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the estimated redemption rate 

adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 an increase or decrease in the estimated redemption rate of 5 would not have a material impact on our operating income in fiscal 2020 ​ 

income taxes 

​ 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws

​ 

we recognize deferred income taxes for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of enactment a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized in full the estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from applicable taxing authorities 

​ 

judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

our market 

we operate within the large and growing us beauty products and salon services industry this market represents approximately 150 billion in sales according to euromonitor international and ibis world inc the approximately 89 billion beauty products industry includes cosmetics haircare fragrance bath and body skincare salon styling tools and other toiletries we estimate that ulta beauty has only an 8 share of the 89 billion beauty product industry within this market we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige mass and salon products our assortment strategy is built to maximize our opportunity in this industry the approximately 61 billion salon services industry consists of hair skin and nail services we estimate that ulta beauty has less than 1 share of this industry we have fullservice hair salons and skin services in substantially every store and operate brow bars in most of our stores as well as makeup services through our salons 

our research indicates that ulta beauty continues to increase market share across all categories however our research also indicates that the cosmetics category in the overall us market experienced declines in 2019 beauty cycles are impacted by demographics trends and product innovation while demographic trends continue to be favorable we believe a lack of incremental product innovation has resulted in a challenging cycle for the cosmetics category as innovation brought to the market has not resulted in incremental product purchases despite the overall market decline in the cosmetics category we remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model our commitment to strategic investments and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains for ulta beauty

our rigorous analytical approach to site selection has translated into a high performing real estate portfolio the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store is approximately 13 million which includes capital investments net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors including geographic location 

while we have opportunity to expand our footprint within the us in fiscal 2019 we announced our decision to expand internationally and establish ulta beauty as a global brand with our first market entry in canada

vendor partnerships 

we have strong active relationships with our more than 400 vendor partners our top ten vendor partners such as estée lauder companies l’oréal and shiseido among others represented approximately 61 and 62 of our total net sales in fiscal 2019 and our fiscal year ended february 2 2019 fiscal 2018 respectively we believe our vendor partners view us as a significant distribution channel for growth and brand enhancement and we work closely with them to market both new and existing brands

marketing and advertising 

we employ a multifaceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness drive traffic to our stores website and mobile applications acquire new guests improve guest retention and increase frequency of shopping we communicate with our guests and prospective guests through multiple vehicles including print advertising digital and social media and television and radio these vehicles highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige mass and salon beauty products new products and services and special offers our comprehensive public relations strategy enhances ulta beauty’s reputation as a beauty destination increases brand awareness supports our charitable efforts related to the ulta beauty charitable foundation and drives awareness of new products instore events and new store openings

 item 1a risk factor s 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or future growth we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the united states as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment in our common stock 

the coronavirus covid19 will have a negative impact on our business financial condition profitability cash flows and supply chain as well as consumer spending 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic federal state and local governments have since implemented various restrictions including travel restrictions border closings restrictions on public gatherings quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus shelterinplace restrictions and limitations on business operations in response to government recommendations and for the health and safety of our associates ie employees and guests we announced on march 17 2020 our decision to temporarily close all stores across the us while too early to quantify our sales and results of operations will be negatively impacted by this decision even after our stores are reopened the virus could also negatively impact our results of operations by continuing to weaken demand for our products and services andor by disrupting our supply chain as events are rapidly changing we are unable to accurately predict the impact that covid19 will have on our business financial condition profitability cash flows and supply chain due to uncertainties including but not limited to the duration of the closing of our stores the duration of quarantines shelterinplace and other travel restrictions within us and other affected countries the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak and the public’s response to the outbreak and its eventual aftermath 

epidemics pandemics like covid19 natural disasters or other catastrophes or crises could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

​ 

epidemics pandemics or other public health crises natural disasters such as hurricanes tornados wildfires earthquakes and mudslides as well as acts of violence or terrorism could result in physical damage to our properties the temporary closure of stores andor distribution and fast fulfillment centers the temporary lack of an adequate work force the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products or a substantial increase in the cost of those products from domestic or foreign suppliers the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods both to and from our distribution and fast fulfillment centers or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores andor the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers accordingly if one or more epidemics pandemics natural disasters andor acts of violence or terrorism were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to incur increased costs 

the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally both in the us and internationally we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates tax rates the availability of consumer credit consumer confidence in future economic conditions and risks or the public perception of risks related to epidemics or pandemics like covid19 in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or acute recession consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales

in addition a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our vendor partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows additionally volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets in the recent global recession had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth which in turn led to declines in consumer spending reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our longrange strategic and financial plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans or longrange strategic imperatives including our efficiencies for growth cost optimization program and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future our continued expansion places increased demands on our financial managerial operational supplychain and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales may decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to

 

if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons online capabilities of national retailers pureplay ecommerce companies catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our guests’ shopping experience and the 

convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance including

 ​ 

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock may decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements “selected quarterly financial data unaudited” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn an outbreak of flu or other viruses such as covid19 a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we may respond by increasing markdowns initiating marketing promotions or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income

​ 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 25000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as the recent outbreak of covid19 labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our ecommerce platform exposes us to certain additional risks which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we offer most of our beauty products for sale through our ultacom website and through our mobile applications as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers supporting product offerings through these channels can create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce platform successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing guests rather than new guests who choose to purchase products from us online or through our mobile applications rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors additionally omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors as we continue to grow our ecommerce platform the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests conflicts between product offerings online or through our mobile applications and through our stores and opening up our channels to increased competition from pureplay ecommerce companies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant guestfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected

cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest employee company andor business partners’ information damage our reputation and expose us to liability which could negatively impact our business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect process and store sensitive and confidential data including our proprietary business information and that of our guests suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches attacks by hackers acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our business products and services which could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems or any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems including management supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions to effectively manage our business we have also identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support historical and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products the processing of transactions our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders andor the reporting of financial results

our ecommerce operations are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website and our mobile applications serve as an effective extension of ulta beauty’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta beauty brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website mobile applications and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our ulta beauty branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced such as covid19 adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our distribution and fast fulfillment centers may not be adequate to support our historical growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we currently operate four distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce platform and one fast fulfillment center ecommerce only in 2014 we began a multiyear supply chain project which focused on among other things adding capacity and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities to support our historical and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business it is likely additional distribution centers or fast fulfillment centers will be added in the future our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

we rely on our good relationships with vendor partners to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendor partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements with vendor partners and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendor partners our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendor partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendor partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendor partners or if we fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendor partners of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position

during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 merchandise supplied to ulta beauty by our top ten vendor partners accounted for approximately 61 and 62 of our net sales respectively there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendor partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased and mobile communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or source the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter instagram and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

​ 

litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation proceedings or claims including possible fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses 

from time to time we are subject to litigation including potential class action and singleplaintiff litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims in the ordinary course of our business operations regarding but not limited to employment matters consumer claims security of consumer and employee personal information contractual relations with suppliers marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties may be necessary which could absorb significant management time result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we establish accruals for potential liability arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability in addition actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter or in the aggregate any resolution of litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims could materially adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

specifically our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors andor ulta beauty branded products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technologies products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta beauty branded products some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including ulta beauty branded products and gifts with purchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including the ulta beauty collection and ulta beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta beauty products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution 

and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta beauty products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta beauty branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

 

in addition greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment which could result in future tax transportation and utility increases which could adversely affect our business there is also increased focus including by investors guests and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters including the use of plastic energy waste and worker safety our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters which could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta beauty branded products are also subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including fda ftc cpsc and various state and local agencies such as state ags and district attorneys if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta beauty branded products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties claims or product recalls which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business

additionally the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta beauty branded products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with federal state or local requirements when we advertise our products including prices or services or engage in other 

promotional activities in digital including social media television or print may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on “the possibilities are beautiful ® ” “ulta beauty” “ulta” and other marks incorporating our name and “all things beauty all in one place ® ” and “21 days of beauty ® ” copyrights in our website and mobile applications content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta beauty branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business and our digital innovations such as tryon applications and artificial intelligence as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason including any cybersecurity incident that results in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our ulta beauty branded products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta beauty branded products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably

as we grow the number of our stores in new locations we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we increase the number of our stores in new locations our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior build out of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes any such increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 10 billion secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in march 2025 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at either a base rate plus a margin of 0 to 0125 or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin of 1125 to 125 and the unused line fee is 020 per annum the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment

the market price for our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including

 

in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which could reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows

our stock repurchase programs could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

we may have in place from time to time a stock repurchase program any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions we may affect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition lease obligations inventory valuation vendor allowances impairment of longlived tangible assets customer loyalty program sharebased compensation tax matters and litigation are complex and involve subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could negatively affect our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition

we are a holding company with no operations of our own and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash 

we are a holding company and we do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries our operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to repurchase stock or pay dividends if declared by our board of directors in the future is dependent on the earnings of and receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us and them to make scheduled payments on our obligations will depend on their future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include

 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points a compelling value proposition and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment we define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category and has high expectations for the shopping experience we estimate the beauty enthusiasts represents approximately 57 of shoppers and 77 of spend in the us beauty category we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance

we are the largest beauty retailer in the united states and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics fragrance skin care products hair care products and salon services we provide unmatched product breadth value and convenience in a distinctive specialty retail environment key aspects of our business include our ability to offer our guests a unique combination of more than 25000 beauty products from across the categories of prestige and mass cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as a fullservice salon in every store featuring hair skin and brow services our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories and convenience as our stores are predominantly located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic imperatives 1 drive growth across beauty enthusiast consumer groups 2 deepen ulta beauty love and loyalty 3 deliver a one of a kind world class beauty assortment 4 lead the instore and beauty services experience transformation 5 reinvent beauty digital engagement 6 deliver operational excellence and drive efficiencies and 7 invest in talent that drives a winning culture we believe that the expanding us beauty products and salon services industry the shift in distribution channel of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta beauty’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry

comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others

over the long term our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable sales opening new stores and increasing omnichannel capabilities operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a 1500 to 1700 store chain in the us with successful ecommerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities

current business trends 

​ 

our research indicates that ulta beauty continues to drive meaningful market share across all categories however our research also suggests that the cosmetics category in the overall us market experienced midsingle digit declines through fiscal 2019 beauty cycles are impacted by demographics and innovation while demographic trends continue to be favorable we believe a lack of incremental innovation has resulted in a challenging cycle for the cosmetics category as innovation brought to the market has not resulted in incremental product purchases despite the overall market decline in the cosmetics category we remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model our commitment to strategic investments and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains

​ 

covid19 

in late 2019 covid19 was detected in wuhan china and other jurisdictions prompting the chinese government to quarantine certain affected regions and impose both internal and external travel restrictions within the country the virus has since spread to almost every other part of the world including the us and in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic federal state and local governments have since implemented various restrictions including travel restrictions border closings restrictions on public gatherings quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus shelterinplace restrictions and limitations on business operations in response to government recommendations and for the health and safety of our associates and guests we announced on march 17 2020 our decision to temporarily close all stores across the us while too early to quantify our sales and results of operations will be negatively impacted by this decision even after our stores are reopened the virus could also negatively impact our results of operations by continuing to weaken demand for our products and services andor by disrupting our supply chain as events are rapidly changing we are unable to accurately predict the impact that covid19 will have on our results of operations due to uncertainties including but not limited to the duration of the closing of our stores the duration of quarantines shelterinplace and other travel restrictions within the us and other affected countries the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak and the public’s response to the outbreak and its eventual aftermath 

basis of presentation

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for rent capital expenditures for new remodeled relocated and refreshed stores prestige boutiques and related instore merchandising upgrades increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions instore boutiques sets of customdesigned fixtures configured to prominently display certain prestige brands within our stores supply chain improvements share repurchases and continued improvement in our information technology systems

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories and cash and cash equivalents reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017

 operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash lease expense deferred income taxes stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes the fiscal 2019 increase over fiscal 2018 is mainly due to the increase in net income merchandise inventories other assets and liabilities and the timing of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by the timing of accounts payable the increase in net income was due to an increase in gross profit due to sales increases and improvements in merchandise margins partially offset by increased sga expenses due to investments in future growth changes in other assets and liabilities was primarily due to increased participation in our deferred compensation plan merchandise inventories net were 12937 million at february 1 2020 compared to 12143 million at february 2 2019 representing an increase of 794 million or 65 

average inventory per store defined as merchandise inventory divided by number of stores open was flat compared to prior year the increase in inventory is primarily due to the addition on 80 net new stores opened since february 2 2019 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new remodeled relocated and refreshed stores supply chain investments shortterm investments and investments in information technology systems investment activities for capital expenditures were 2985 million in fiscal 2019 compared to 3194 million and 4407 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively capital expenditures decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily from lower merchandising fixtures due to less spend on store refreshes and a decrease in the number of store openings offset by increases in store maintenance and other due to corporate office renovations purchases of shortterm investments were 1100 million during fiscal 2019 and consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of three to twelve months from the date of purchase

the following table presents a summary of our store activities in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 

 ​ 

during fiscal 2019 the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store was approximately 13 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables the average investment required to remodel an ulta beauty store was approximately 09 million in fiscal 2019 the average investment required to refresh an ulta beauty store was approximately 01 million in fiscal 2019 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 by major category are as follows

 ​ 

our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new remodeled and relocated stores information technology systems and supply chain investments that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 consist principally of share repurchases and capital stock transactions purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may 

require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods for unexpected business disruptions to support our new store program share repurchases and seasonal inventory needs as a precautionary measure and to enhance financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty arising from the spread of covid19 on march 23 2020 the company announced that it drew down 800 million under the amended loan agreement

credit facility 

on august 23 2017 we entered into a second amended and restated loan agreement the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo bank national association and jpmorgan chase bank na as lead arrangers and bookrunners jpmorgan chase bank na as syndication agent and a lender pnc bank national association as documentation agent and a lender and the other lenders party thereto the loan agreement matures on august 23 2022 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 4000 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory which borrowing base may at the election of the company and satisfaction of certain conditions include a percentage of eligible owned receivables and qualified cash contains a 200 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 500 million subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 10 to 10 during such periods when availability under the loan agreement falls below a specified threshold substantially all of the company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the loan agreement outstanding borrowings will bear interest at either a base rate or the libor plus 125 and the unused line fee is 020 per annum

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mother’s day and valentine’s day season any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and sga expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any future debt

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of february 1 2020 we have not entered into any “offbalance sheet” arrangements as that term is described by the sec we do however have offbalance sheet purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business as indicated within the contractual obligations table below

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of february 1 2020

 

 

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services excluded from our purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of 

business the amount of purchase obligations relates to commitments made to a third party for products and services for the new fast fulfillment center expected to open in fiscal 2021 advertising and other goods and service contracts entered into as of february 1 2020

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market net realizable value cost is determined using the moving average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the inventory reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 an increase or decrease in the lower of cost or market net realizable value reserve of 10 would not have a material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2019 an increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10 would not have a material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2019

vendor allowances 

the majority of cash consideration received from a vendor is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors’ products we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in receivables we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory an increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would not have a material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2019

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable assets are primarily reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term an 

impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying amount of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges no significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2019 fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017

loyalty program 

we maintain a customer loyalty program ultamate rewards which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise or services points earned are valid for at least one year the loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be redeemed on future products and services revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when the members redeem points or points expire we defer revenue related to points earned that have not yet been redeemed the amount of deferred revenue includes estimates for the standalone selling price of points earned by members and the percentage of points expected to be redeemed the expected redemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the estimated redemption rate 

adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 an increase or decrease in the estimated redemption rate of 5 would not have a material impact on our pretax income in fiscal 2019 

income taxes 

​ 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws

​ 

we recognize deferred income taxes for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period of enactment a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized in full the estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from applicable taxing authorities 

​ 

judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

our real estate vision is to make ulta beauty accessible and convenient to more consumers across a variety of markets a key part of how we plan to expand our market share over time we believe that over the long term we have the potential to grow our store base to between 1500 to 1700 ulta beauty stores in the united states we plan to further penetrate existing suburban markets expand our presence in small markets and further develop urban markets our rigorous analytical approach to site selection has translated into a high performing real estate portfolio we expect to open approximately 70 to 80 new stores per year for the next several years the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store is approximately 14 million which includes capital investments net of landlord contributions pre

merchandising 

strategy 

we offer one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools a typical ulta beauty store carries more than 25000 products from approximately 500 wellestablished and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points including ulta beauty’s own private label the ulta beauty collection we present these products in an opensell environment using centrally produced planograms detailed schematics showing product placement in the store and promotional merchandising planners our merchandising team continually monitors current fashion trends historical sales trends and new product launches to keep ulta beauty’s product assortment fresh and relevant to our guests we believe our broad selection of merchandise from moderatepriced brands to higherend prestige brands creates a unique shopping experience for our guests 

we believe our private label products the ulta beauty collection are a strategically important category for growth and profit contribution our objective is to provide quality trendright private label products to continue to strengthen our guests’ perception of ulta beauty as a contemporary beauty destination ulta beauty manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production in order to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas to build our brand image we also offer products such as tarte double duty beauty cosmetics it brushes for ulta beauty and chi for ulta beauty hair care appliances that are permanently exclusive to ulta beauty we also offer a number of products that are exclusive for a limited time or are offered in advance of our competitors the ulta beauty collection and ulta beauty exclusive products both permanent and temporary represented approximately 65 of our total net sales in fiscal 2018 

categories 

we offer a balanced portfolio across five primary categories 1 cosmetics 2 skincare bath and fragrance 3 haircare products and styling tools 4 salon services and 5 other which includes nail products and accessories we have gained market share across all categories of our business 

 

the following table sets forth the approximate percentage of net sales attributed to each category for the periods presented

our merchandising team works to ensure consistent execution across our store base and ecommerce platform we have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy we centrally manage product replenishment to our stores through our merchandise planning group this group serves as a strategic partner to and provides financial oversight of the merchandising team the merchandising team creates a sales forecast by category for the year our merchandise planning group creates an opentobuy plan approved by senior executives for each product category the opentobuy plan is updated weekly with pointofsale pos data receipts and inventory levels and is used throughout the year to balance buying opportunities and inventory return on investment we believe this structure maximizes our buying opportunities while maintaining organizational and financial control regularly replenished products are presented consistently in all stores utilizing a merchandising planogram process pos data is used to calculate sales forecasts and to determine replenishment levels we determine promotional product replenishment levels using sales history from similar or comparable events to ensure our inventory remains productive our planning and replenishment group along with senior executives monitor the levels of clearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis we continue to optimize our merchandising planning and forecasting system master data and space and floor planning systems 

vendor partnerships

marketing and advertising 

marketing strategy 

we employ a multifaceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness drive traffic to our stores website and mobile applications acquire new guests improve guest retention and increase frequency of shopping we communicate with our guests and prospective guests through multiple vehicles including print advertising digital and social media and television and radio these vehicles highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige mass and salon beauty products new products and services and special offers our comprehensive public relations strategy enhances ulta beauty’s reputation as a beauty destination increases brand awareness supports our charitable efforts related to the ulta beauty charitable foundation and drives awareness of new products instore events and new store openings 

our loyalty program ultamate rewards is an important tool to increase retention of existing guests and to enhance their loyalty to the ulta beauty brand approximately 318 million active loyalty program members generated more than 95 of ulta beauty’s total net sales in fiscal 2018 ultamate rewards enables customers to earn points based on their purchases points earned are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell or service provided our crm platform enables sophisticated analysis of the customer data in our loyalty member database as well as greater personalization of our marketing campaigns to enhance our loyalty program we offer cobranded and private label credit cards the credit cards drive higher wallet share and greater loyalty from our rewards members provide increased consumer insights and offer attractive economics we continue to expand our gift card program to increase distribution to thousands of supermarkets and other retailers through a partnership with third parties 

we are directing a growing percentage of our marketing expense towards email marketing digital and social marketing and national tv and radio advertising we believe these channels are highly effective in communicating with existing guests as well as reaching those who have not yet shopped with us our email marketing program has been effective in communicating with our existing online mobile and retail guests in a targeted and relevant way our digital marketing strategy includes search engine optimization paid search mobile advertising social media display advertising and other digital marketing channels digital marketing coupled with our national tv and radio advertising has helped us grow brand awareness among those not familiar with ulta beauty which we believe has resulted in new guests

our vision is to develop an expanded and optimized endtoend supply chain that improves operational efficiency performance and guest experience this includes enhanced systems and processes as well as a modernized distribution center network to support our new store program and rapid ecommerce growth currently we operate five distribution centers starting in fiscal 2019 we expect to open a fast fulfillment center and pilot “ship from store” capabilities to reduce ecommerce shipment time 

inventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution centers we carry more than 25000 products and replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches ie lessthancase quantities which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required our distribution centers use distribution management and distribution control software systems to maintain and support product purchase decisions store replenishment order selection is performed using picktolight processing technologies product is delivered to stores using a broad network of contract and local pool final mile carriers

we believe our trademarks especially those related to the ulta beauty brand “the possibilities are beautiful ® ” and “21 days of beauty ® ” have significant value and are important to building brand recognition 

government regulation 

we are affected by extensive laws governmental regulations administrative determinations court decisions and similar constraints such laws regulations and other constraints exist at the federal state or local levels in the united states the products we sell in our stores such as cosmetics dietary supplements food and overthecounter otc drugs medical devices and styling tools including our ulta beauty branded products may be subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda the us federal trade commission ftc the consumer product safety commission cpsc the environmental protection agency epa state regulatory agencies and state attorneys general state ags such regulations principally relate to the safety labeling manufacturing advertising and distribution of the products in addition the salon services provided in our stores may be subject to state and local regulations

further statements we make in advertising including statements about the safety or efficacy of products pricing and environmental claims are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws which generally prohibit unfair or deceptive practices 

labor and employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject also impact our daytoday operations we are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws both federal and state our services business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements 

in our store leases we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use but at times the responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or buildouts that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or buildouts 

 

employees 

as of february 2 2019 we employed approximately 16000 associates on a fulltime basis and approximately 28000 associates on a parttime basis we have no collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relationships with our employees 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mother’s day valentine’s day and the “back to school” season

 item 1a risk factor s 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or future growth we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the united states as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment in our common stock 

the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally both in the us and internationally we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates tax rates the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or acute recession consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales 

in addition a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our vendor partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows additionally volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets in the recent global recession had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth which in turn led to declines in consumer spending reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased 

 

by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons online capabilities of national retailers pureplay ecommerce companies catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our guests’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance including 























  

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock may decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements “selected quarterly financial data unaudited” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our distribution centers may not be adequate to support our historical growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we currently operate five distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce platform in 2014 we began a multiyear supply chain project which focused on among other things adding capacity and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities in order to support our historical and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business it is likely additional distribution centers or fast fulfillment centers ecommerce only will be 

 

added in the future our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 25000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire natural disasters or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ecommerce platform may be unsuccessful 

we offer most of our beauty products for sale through our ultacom website as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers supporting product offerings through these channels could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce platform successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing guests rather than new guests who choose to purchase products from us online or through our mobile applications rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors as we continue to grow our ecommerce platform the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests conflicts between product offerings online or through our mobile applications and through our stores and opening up our channels to increased competition from pureplay ecommerce companies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our longrange strategic and financial plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans or longrange strategic imperatives including our efficiencies for growth cost optimization program and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future our continued expansion places increased demands on our financial managerial operational supplychain and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest employee company andor business partners’ information damage our reputation and expose us to liability which could negatively impact our business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect process and store sensitive and confidential data including our proprietary business information and that of our guests suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches attacks by hackers acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our business products and services which could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems or any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems including management supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions to effectively manage our business we have also identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support historical and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products the processing of transactions our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders andor the reporting of financial results 

our ecommerce operations are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website and our mobile applications serve as an effective extension of ulta beauty’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta beauty brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website mobile applications and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our ulta beauty branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations 

 

and performance will be subject to these factors and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we may respond by increasing markdowns initiating marketing promotions or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendor partners to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendor partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements with vendor partners and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendor partners our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendor partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendor partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendor partners or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendor partners of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

 

during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 merchandise supplied to ulta beauty by our top ten vendor partners accounted for approximately 62 and 64 of our net sales respectively there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendor partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased and mobile communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or source the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter instagram and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation proceedings or claims including possible fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses 

from time to time we are subject to litigation including potential class action and singleplaintiff litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims in the ordinary course of our business operations regarding but not limited to employment matters consumer claims security of consumer and employee personal information contractual relations with suppliers marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties may be necessary which could absorb significant management time result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we establish accruals for potential liability arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability in addition actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter or in the aggregate any resolution of litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims could materially adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

specifically our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors andor ulta beauty branded products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto 

 

proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technologies products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta beauty branded products some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales may decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 











if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on “the possibilities are beautiful ® ” “ulta beauty” “ulta” and other marks incorporating our name and “all things beauty all in one place ® ” and “21 days of beauty ® ” copyrights in our website and mobile applications content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta beauty branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business and our digital innovations such as tryon applications and artificial intelligence as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason including any cybersecurity incident that results in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including ulta beauty branded products and gifts with purchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including the ulta beauty collection and ulta beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta beauty products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution 

 

and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta beauty products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta beauty branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 









in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta beauty branded products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including fda ftc cpsc and various state and local agencies such as state ags and district attorneys if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta beauty branded products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties claims or product recalls which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business 

in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta beauty branded products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with federal state or local requirements when we advertise our products including prices or services or engage in other promotional activities in digital including social media television or print may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

 

our ulta beauty branded products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta beauty branded products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

natural disasters or other catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

natural disasters such as hurricanes tornados wildfires earthquakes and mudslides as well as acts of violence or terrorism could result in physical damage to our properties the temporary closure of stores andor distribution centers the temporary lack of an adequate work force the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products or a substantial increase in the cost of those products from domestic or foreign suppliers the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods both to and from our distribution centers or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores andor the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers accordingly if one or more natural disasters andor acts of violence or terrorism were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to incur increased costs 

  

as we grow the number of our stores in new locations we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new locations our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior build out of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in 

 

some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes any such increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 400 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in august 2022 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at either a base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus 125 and the unused line fee is 020 per annum the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

























in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which could reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our previously announced stock repurchase programs and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

we may have in place from time to time a stock repurchase program any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions we may affect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition lease obligations inventory valuation vendor allowances impairment of longlived tangible assets customer loyalty program sharebased compensation tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could negatively affect our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are a holding company with no operations of our own and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash 

we are a holding company and we do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries our operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to repurchase stock or pay dividends if declared by our board of directors in the future is dependent on the earnings of and receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us and them to make scheduled payments on our obligations will depend on their future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control 

 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 













we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points a compelling value proposition and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment we define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category and has high expectations for the shopping experience we estimate the beauty enthusiasts represents approximately 57 of shoppers and 77 of spend in the us beauty category we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance

retail stores coupled with ulta beauty’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry 

comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others 

over the long term our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable sales opening new stores and increasing omnichannel capabilities operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a 1500 to 1700 store chain in the us with successful ecommerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities 

basis of presentation

comparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period comparable sales include retail sales salon services and ecommerce there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 

measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results 















 

cost of sales includes 













our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales this presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for rent capital expenditures for new remodeled relocated and refreshed stores prestige boutiques and related instore merchandising upgrades increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions instore boutiques sets of customdesigned fixtures configured to prominently display certain prestige brands within our stores supply chain improvements share repurchases and continued improvement in our information technology systems 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories and cash and cash equivalents reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months 

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 



 

operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes noncash stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes net of acquisitions 

merchandise inventories net were 12143 million at february 2 2019 compared to 10964 million at february 3 2018 representing an increase of 1179 million or 108 average inventory per store increased 13 compared to prior year the increase in inventory is primarily due to the following 







deferred rent liabilities were 4350 million at february 2 2019 an increase of 271 million compared to 4079 million at february 3 2018 deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases free rent and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is primarily due to the addition of 100 net new stores opened since february 3 2018 and corporate and supply chain expansion 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new remodeled relocated and refreshed stores supply chain investments shortterm investments and investments in information technology systems investment activities for capital expenditures were 3194 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 4407 million and 3734 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively capital expenditures decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 mainly due to lower cost in the new store program less store refreshes and total reduction in spend on information technology systems purchases of shortterm investments were 3862 million during fiscal 2018 and consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase 

the following table presents a summary of our store activities in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 



  

during fiscal 2018 the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store was approximately 14 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables the average investment required to remodel an ulta beauty store was approximately 10 million in fiscal 2018 the average investment required to refresh an ulta beauty store was approximately 05 million in fiscal 2018 

 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 by major category are as follows 



  

our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new remodeled and relocated stores information technology systems and supply chain investments that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we expect to selffund future capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately 390 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 we are continuing our multiyear supply chain project which includes adding capacity and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 consist principally of share repurchases and capital stock transactions purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program share repurchases and seasonal inventory needs 

share repurchase plan 

on march 10 2016 we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the 2016 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to 4250 million of the company’s common stock the 2016 share repurchase program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts of 1724 million from the earlier share repurchase program the 2016 share repurchase program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time

on march 9 2017 we announced that the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program the 2017 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to 4250 million of the company’s common stock the 2017 share repurchase program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amount 

 

of 799 million from the earlier share repurchase program the 2017 share repurchase program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time 

on march 15 2018 we announced that the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program the 2018 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to 6250 million of the company’s common stock the 2018 share repurchase program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amount of 413 million from the 2017 share repurchase program the 2018 share repurchase program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time

credit facility 

on august 23 2017 we entered into a second amended and restated loan agreement the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo bank national association and jpmorgan chase bank na as lead arrangers and bookrunners jpmorgan chase bank na as syndication agent and a lender pnc bank national association as documentation agent and a lender and the other lenders party thereto the loan agreement matures on august 23 2022 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 4000 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory which borrowing base may at the election of the company and satisfaction of certain conditions include a percentage of eligible owned receivables and qualified cash contains a 200 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 500 million subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 10 to 10 during such periods when availability under the loan agreement falls below a specified threshold substantially all of the company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the loan agreement outstanding borrowings will bear interest at either a base rate or the libor plus 125 and the unused line fee is 020 per annum 

as of february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the loan agreement 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mother’s day valentine’s day as well as the “back to school” season any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and sga expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any future debt 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of february 2 2019 we have not entered into any “offbalance sheet” arrangements as that term is described by the sec we do however have offbalance sheet operating leases and purchases obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business as indicated within the contractual obligations table below 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of february 2 2019 







we lease retail stores distribution centers corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2032 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable 

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services excluded from our purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business the amount of purchase obligations relates to commitments made to a third party for products and services for the new fast fulfillment center expected to open in fiscal 2020 advertising and other goods and service contracts entered into as of february 2 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market or shrink reserves adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 an increase or decrease in the lower of cost or market reserve of 10 would not have a material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2018 an increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10 would not have a material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2018 

vendor allowances 

the majority of cash consideration received from a supplier is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors’ products we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in receivables we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory an increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would not have a material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2018 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable assets are primarily reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges no significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2018 fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016 

loyalty program 

we maintain a customer loyalty program ultamate rewards which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise or services  points earned are valid for at least one year the loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be redeemed on future products and services the relative standalone selling price of points earned by members is included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets based on the percentage of points expected to be redeemed the expected redemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the estimated redemption rate 

 

adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 an increase or decrease in the estimated redemption rate of 5 would not have a material impact on our pretax income in fiscal 2018 

income taxes 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

  

we recognize deferred income taxes for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period of enactment a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized in full the estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from applicable taxing authorities 

  

judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factor s 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or future growth we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the united states as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment in our common stock 

the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally both in the us and internationally we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates tax rates the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or acute recession consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales 

in addition a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our vendor partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows additionally volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets in the recent global 

 

recession had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth which in turn led to declines in consumer spending reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons online capabilities of national retailers pureplay ecommerce companies catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our guests’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest employee company andor business partners’ information damage our reputation and expose us to liability which could negatively impact our business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect process and store sensitive and confidential data including our proprietary business information and that of our guests suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches attacks by hackers acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our business products and services which could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance including 

















 







  

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock may decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements “selected quarterly financial data unaudited” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales may decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 











if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our newly opened and to be opened distribution centers may not be adequate to support our historical growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we currently operate five distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce platform in 2014 we began a multiyear supply chain project which focused on among other things adding capacity and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities in order to support our historical and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business it is likely additional distribution centers will be added in the future we opened our fourth and fifth distribution centers in 2015 and 2016 respectively and expect to open our sixth distribution center in 2018 our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in 

 

stores and the performance of our newly opened distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 20000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire natural disasters or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ecommerce platform may be unsuccessful 

we offer most of our beauty products for sale through our ultacom website as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our participation in both ecommerce and physical store sales is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers supporting product offerings through both of these channels could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce platform successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing guests rather than new guests who choose to purchase products from us online rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products offering products through our internet channel could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors as we continue to grow our ecommerce platform the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests conflicts between product offerings online and through our stores and opening up our channels to increased competition from pureplay ecommerce companies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our longrange strategic and financial plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans or longrange strategic imperatives and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future our continued expansion places increased demands on our financial managerial operational supplychain and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems or any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems including management supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions to effectively manage our business we have also identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support historical and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products the processing of transactions our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders andor the reporting of financial results 

our ecommerce operations are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta beauty’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta beauty brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our ulta beauty branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we may 

 

respond by increasing markdowns initiating marketing promotions or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendor partners to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendor partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements with vendor partners and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendor partners our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendor partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendor partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendor partners or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendor partners of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 merchandise supplied to ulta beauty by our top ten vendor partners accounted for approximately 64 of our net sales there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendor partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta beauty” “ulta” “all things beauty all in one place tm ” and other marks incorporating our name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta beauty branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason including any cybersecurity incident that results in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including ulta beauty branded products and gifts with purchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including the ulta beauty collection and ulta beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta beauty products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta beauty products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta beauty branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 









in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta beauty branded products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including fda ftc cpsc and various state and local agencies such as state ags and district attorneys if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta beauty branded products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to 

 

significant penalties claims or product recalls which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business 

in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta beauty branded products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with federal state or local requirements when we advertise our products including prices or services or engage in other promotional activities in digital including social media television or print may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

our ulta beauty branded products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta beauty branded products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter instagram and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation proceedings or claims including possible fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims in the ordinary course of our business operations regarding but not limited to employment matters security of consumer and employee personal information contractual relations with suppliers marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties may be necessary which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we establish accruals for potential liability arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability in addition actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter or in the aggregate an unfavorable resolution of litigation or other legal or 

 

regulatory proceedings or claims could materially adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

specifically our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors andor ulta beauty branded products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta beauty branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

natural disasters or other catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

natural disasters such as hurricanes tornados wildfires earthquakes and mudslides as well as acts of violence or terrorism could result in physical damage to our properties the temporary closure of stores andor distribution centers the temporary lack of an adequate work force the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products or a substantial increase in the cost of those products from domestic or foreign suppliers the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods both to and from our distribution centers or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores andor the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers accordingly if one or more natural disasters andor acts of violence or terrorism were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to incur increased costs 

  

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior build out of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a 

 

timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes any such increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 400 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in august 2022 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at either a base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus 125 and the unused line fee is 020 per annum the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

























 

in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which could reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 













we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future 

any dividend payments will be within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements capital expenditure requirements contractual restrictions anticipated cash needs provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

our previously announced stock repurchase programs and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

we may have in place from time to time a stock repurchase program any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions we may 

 

affect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition lease obligations inventory valuation vendor allowances impairment of longlived tangible assets customer loyalty program sharebased compensation tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could negatively affect our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are a holding company with no operations of our own and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash 

we are a holding company and we do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries our operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to repurchase stock or pay dividends if declared by our board of directors in the future is dependent on the earnings of and receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us and them to make scheduled payments on our obligations will depend on their future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10‑k

over the long term our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable sales opening new stores and increasing ecommerce sales operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a 1400 to 1700 store chain with successful ecommerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities 

basis of presentation 

we have determined the operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance we have combined our three operating segments retail stores salon services and ecommerce into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumers economic characteristics nature of products and distribution methods 

net sales include retail store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores ecommerce sales are recognized based on delivery of merchandise to the guest retail store and ecommerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

comparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period comparable sales include the company’s ecommerce business there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 

measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results

income tax expense of 2316 million in fiscal 2017 represents an effective tax rate of 294 compared to fiscal 2016 tax expense of 2460 million and an effective tax rate of 375 the lower tax rate is primarily due to a reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities and a lower effective tax rate in january 2018 as a result of tax reform and the adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal 2017 for employee sharebased payments see note 6 “income taxes” for further information 

 

we expect our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate to be significantly lower than our fiscal 2017 effective tax rate as a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new remodeled and relocated stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions instore boutiques sets of customdesigned fixtures configured to prominently display certain prestige brands within our stores supply chain improvements share repurchases and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and tax reform and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 

  



 

operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

merchandise inventories were 10964 million at february 3 2018 compared to 9440 million at january 28 2017 representing an increase of 1524 million or 161 average inventory per store increased 53 compared to prior year the increase in inventory is primarily due to the following 







deferred rent liabilities were 4079 million at february 3 2018 an increase of 417 million compared to 3662 million at january 28 2017 deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases free rent and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is primarily due to the addition of 100 net new stores opened since january 28 2017 and corporate and supply chain expansion 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new remodeled and refreshed stores supply chain investments shortterm investments and investments in information technology systems investment activities for capital expenditures were 4407 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 3734 million and 2992 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 mainly due to our new store program store refreshes prestige boutiques and related instore merchandising upgrades and information systems investments purchases of shortterm investments were 330 million during fiscal 2017 and consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase 

the following table presents a summary of our store activities in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 



  

during fiscal 2017 the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store was approximately 16 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables the average investment required to remodel an ulta beauty store was approximately 11 million in fiscal 2017 the average investment required to refresh an ulta beauty store was approximately 04 million in fiscal 2017 

 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 budget 2017 2016 and 2015 by major category are as follows 



  

our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new remodeled and relocated stores supply chain investments and information technology systems that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we expect to selffund future capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately 375 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 we embarked on a multiyear supply chain project beginning in fiscal 2014 which included adding capacity with distribution centers opened in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 and another distribution center in fiscal 2018 and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 consist principally of capital stock transactions and our stock repurchase program purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program share repurchases and seasonal inventory needs 

share repurchase plan 

on march 10 2016 we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the 2016 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to 4250 million of the company’s common stock the 2016 share repurchase program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts of 1724 million from the earlier share repurchase program the 2016 share repurchase program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time 

as part of the 2016 share repurchase program we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with goldman sachs  co to repurchase 2000 million of the company’s common stock under the asr agreement the company paid 2000 million to goldman sachs  co and received an initial delivery of 851653 shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which were retired and represented 80 of the total shares the company expected to receive based on the market price at the time of the initial delivery in may 2016 the asr settled and an additional 153418 shares were delivered to the company and retired the final number of shares delivered upon settlement was determined with reference to the average price of the company’s common stock over the term of the agreement the transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction the par value of shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock with the remainder recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital and retained earnings upon receipt of the shares there was an immediate reduction in the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share 

on march 9 2017 we announced that the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program the 2017 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to 4250 million of the company’s common stock the 2017 share repurchase program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amount

credit facility 

on august 23 2017 we entered into a second amended and restated loan agreement the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo bank national association and jpmorgan chase bank na as lead arrangers and bookrunners jpmorgan chase bank na as syndication agent and a lender pnc bank national association as documentation agent and a lender and the other lenders party thereto the loan agreement matures on august 23 2022 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 4000 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory which borrowing base may at the election of the company and satisfaction of certain conditions include a percentage of eligible owned receivables and qualified cash contains a 200 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 500 million subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 10 to 10 during such periods when availability under the loan agreement falls below a specified threshold substantially all of the company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the loan agreement outstanding borrowings will bear interest at either a base rate or the london interbank offered rate plus 125 and the unused line fee is 020 per annum 

as of february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mother’s day valentine’s day as well as the “back to school” season any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any future debt 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of february 3 2018 we have not entered into any “offbalance sheet” arrangements as that term is described by the sec we do however have offbalance sheet operating leases and purchases obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business as indicated within the contractual obligations table below 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of february 3 2018 







we lease retail stores distribution centers corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2032 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable 

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services excluded from our purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business the amount of purchase obligations relates to commitments made to a third party for products and services for the new distribution center expected to open in fiscal 2018 advertising and other goods and service contracts entered into as of february 3 2018 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market or shrink reserves adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 an increase or decrease in the lower of cost or market reserve of 10 would have had no material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2017 an increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10 would have had no material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2017 

vendor allowances 

the majority of cash consideration received from a supplier is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors’ products we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in receivables net at the amount we expect to collect we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory an increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would have affected pretax income by approximately 42 million in fiscal 2017 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges no significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2017 fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015 

customer loyalty program 

we maintain a customer loyalty program ultamate rewards in which program members earn points based on purchases points earned by members are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell we accrue the cost of anticipated redemptions related to this program at the time of the initial purchase based on historical experience we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our redemption rates adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 if our redemption rate were to increase or decrease by 5 it would have affected pretax income by approximately 78 million in fiscal 2017 

 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s common stock the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding the expected life of options granted is derived from historical data on ulta beauty stock option exercises the historical exercise data is updated on an annual basis and the changes have not had a material impact on the calculation in any years presented 

forfeitures of options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of the company’s stock option activity and reduce the compensation expense recognized the forfeiture rate is updated on an annual basis and the changes have not had a material impact on compensation expense recognized in any years presented we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our grant date fair value of stock options or forfeiture rate 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements “summary of significant accounting policies  sharebased compensation” for disclosure related to the company’s stock compensation expense see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions 

income taxes 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

  

we recognize deferred income taxes for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period of enactment a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized in full the estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from applicable taxing authorities 

  

judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

in addition the continued volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while these declines have moderated the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession and economic conditions could lead to further declines in consumer spending in the future additionally there can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our vendor partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons ecommerce businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our guests’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest employee company andor business partners’ information damage our reputation and expose us to liability which could negatively impact our business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect process and store sensitive and confidential data including our proprietary business information and that of our guests suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches attacks by hackers acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our business products and services which could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock may decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements “selected quarterly financial data unaudited” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales may decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

   

  

  

 if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our newly opened and to be opened distribution centers may not be adequate to support our historical growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we currently operate five distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in 2014 we began a multiyear supply chain project which focused on among other things adding capacity and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities in order to support our historical and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business it is likely additional distribution centers will be added in the future we opened our fourth and fifth distribution centers in 2015 and 2016 and expect to open our sixth distribution center in 2018 our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our newly opened distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 20000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ecommerce business may be unsuccessful 

we offer most of our beauty products for sale through our ultacom website as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract 

  

and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our participation in both ecommerce and physical store sales is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers supporting product offerings through both of these channels could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce business successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing guests rather than new guests who choose to purchase products from us online rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products offering products through our internet channel could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors as we continue to grow our ecommerce business the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests conflicts between product offerings online and through our stores and opening up our channels to increased internet competition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our longrange strategic and financial plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans or longrange strategic imperatives and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future our continued expansion places increased demands on our financial managerial operational supplychain and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems or any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems including management supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions to effectively manage our business we have also identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support historical and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products the processing of transactions our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders andor the reporting of financial results 

our ecommerce operations are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta beauty’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta beauty brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

  

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our ulta beauty branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we may respond by increasing markdowns initiating marketing promotions or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

  

we rely on our good relationships with vendor partners to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendor partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements with vendor partners and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendor partners our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendor partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendor partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendor partners or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendor partners of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

during fiscal 2016 merchandise supplied to ulta beauty by our top ten vendor partners accounted for approximately 50 of our net sales there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendor partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta beauty” “ulta” “all things beauty all in one place tm ” and other marks incorporating our name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta beauty branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including ulta beauty branded products and gifts with purchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including the ulta beauty collection and ulta beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta beauty products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or 

  

efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta beauty products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta beauty branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta beauty branded products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including fda ftc cpsc and various state and local agencies such as state ags and district attorneys if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta beauty branded products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties claims or product recalls which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business 

in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta beauty branded products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with federal state or local requirements when we advertise our products including prices or services or engage in other promotional activities in digital including social media television or print may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

  

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior build out of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes any such increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ulta beauty branded products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta beauty branded products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation proceedings or claims including possible fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims in the ordinary course of our business operations regarding but not limited to employment matters security of consumer and employee personal information contractual relations with suppliers marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties may be necessary which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we establish accruals for potential liability arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability in addition actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter or in the 

  

aggregate an unfavorable resolution of litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims could materially adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

specifically our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors andor ulta beauty branded products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta beauty branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter instagram and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in december 2018 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 020 the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which could reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as permitted by our certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future 

we paid a special cash dividend on may 15 2012 any future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements capital expenditure requirements contractual restrictions anticipated cash needs provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

our previously announced stock repurchase programs and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

we may have in place from time to time a stock repurchase program any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions we may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for 

  

our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition lease obligations inventory valuation vendor allowances impairment of longlived tangible assets customer loyalty program sharebased compensation tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could negatively affect our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are a holding company with no operations of our own and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash 

following the reorganization we are a holding company and we do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries our operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to repurchase stock or pay dividends if declared by our board of directors in the future is dependent on the earnings of and receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us and them to make scheduled payments on our obligations will depend on their future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers all things beauty all in one place tm  a compelling value proposition and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer in the united states and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics fragrance skin care products hair care products and salon services we focus on providing affordable indulgence to our guests by combining unmatched product breadth value and convenience with a distinctive specialty retail environment and experience key aspects of our business include our ability to offer our guests a unique combination of more than 20000 beauty products across the categories of prestige and mass cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as a fullservice salon in every store featuring hair skin and brow services our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories and convenience as our stores are predominantly located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic imperatives 1 acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests 2 differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels 3 offer relevant innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests 4 deliver exceptional services in three core areas hair skin health and brows 5 grow stores and ecommerce to reach and serve more guests 6 invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies and 7 attract 

  

and retain talent that drives a winning culture we believe that the expanding us beauty products and salon services industry the shift in distribution channel of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta beauty’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry 

comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable sales by opening new stores and by increasing sales in our ecommerce channel operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a 1400 to 1700 store chain with a successful ecommerce business and competitive omnichannel capabilities 

basis of presentation 

we have determined the operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance we have combined our three operating segments retail stores salon services and ecommerce into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumers economic characteristics nature of products and distribution methods 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores and ecommerce sales are recorded based on delivery of merchandise to the guest stores and ecommerce merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

comparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period comparable sales include the company’s ecommerce business there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 

measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions instore boutiques sets of custom designed fixtures configured to prominently display certain prestige brands within our stores supply chain improvements share repurchases and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand shortterm investments and cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 

 

 operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

merchandise inventories were 9440 million at january 28 2017 compared to 7618 million at january 30 2016 representing an increase of 1822 million or 239 average inventory per store increased 112 compared to prior year the increase in inventory is primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

   

deferred rent liabilities were 3662 million at january 28 2017 an increase of 444 million compared to 3218 million at january 30 2016 deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases free rent and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is primarily due to the addition of 100 net new stores opened since january 30 2016 and corporate and supply chain expansion 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores supply chain investments shortterm investments and investments in information technology systems investment activities for capital expenditures were 3737 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 2992 million and 2491 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 due to our new store program the expansion of prestige boutiques and related instore merchandising upgrades and corporate office expansion during fiscal 2016 we opened 104 new stores remodeled 12 stores and relocated two stores compared to 103 new stores four remodels and five relocations during fiscal 2015 and 100 new stores nine remodels and two relocations during fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2016 the average investment required to open a new ulta store was approximately 14 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables the average investment required to remodel an ulta beauty store was approximately 15 million purchases of shortterm investments were 90 million during fiscal 2016 and consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 and planned fiscal 2017 by major category are as follows 

 

 our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new relocated and remodeled stores supply chain investments and information technology systems that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we expect to selffund future capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately 463 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 in 2017 new remodeled and relocated stores and merchandising capital expenditure increases reflect the prestige brand expansions and the related instore merchandising upgrades as well as incremental spend related to nonprototypical store locations we embarked on a multiyear supply chain project beginning in 2014 which included adding capacity with fourth and fifth distribution centers opened in 2015 and 2016 and plans for a sixth distribution center in 2018 and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax effects and our stock repurchase program purchase of treasury shares in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentine’s day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any future debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 28 2017 we have not entered into any “offbalance sheet” arrangements as that term is described by the sec we do however have offbalance sheet operating leases and purchases obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business as indicated within the contractual obligations table below

 we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2032 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable 

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services excluded from our purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business the amount of purchase obligations relates to commitments made to a third party for products and services for a future distribution center for which a lease has been signed advertising and other goods and service contracts entered into as of january 28 2017 

  

as of january 28 2017 the unrecognized tax benefit was 33 million which is not included in the above table due to uncertainty regarding the realization and timing of the related future cash flows if any 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market or shrink reserves adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 an increase or decrease in the lower of cost or market reserve of 10 would have had no material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2016 an increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10 would have had no material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2016 

vendor allowances 

the majority of cash consideration received from a supplier is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors’ products we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in net receivables at the amount we expect to collect we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory an increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would have affected pretax income by approximately 38 million in fiscal 2016 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating 

  

results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges in fiscal 2016 we recognized 31 million of fixed asset impairment charges related to store closures in chicago illinois and denham springs louisiana no significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2015 or 2014 

customer loyalty program 

we maintain a customer loyalty program ultamate rewards in which program members earn points based on purchases points earned by members are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell we accrue the cost of anticipated redemptions related to this program at the time of the initial purchase based on historical experience we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our redemption rates adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 if our redemption rate were to increase or decrease by 5 it would have affected pretax income by approximately 57 million in fiscal 2016 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s common stock the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding the expected life of options granted is derived from historical data on ulta beauty stock option exercises the historical exercise data is updated on an annual basis and the changes have not had a material impact on the calculation in any years presented 

forfeitures of options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of the company’s stock option activity and reduce the compensation expense recognized the forfeiture rate is updated on an annual basis and the changes have not had a material impact on compensation expense recognized in any years presented we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our grant date fair value of stock options or forfeiture rate

information technology 

we are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position we depend on a variety of information systems and technologies to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing store base we rely on computer systems to provide information for all areas of our business including supply chain merchandising pos ecommerce marketing finance accounting and human resources our core business systems consist mostly of purchased software programs that integrate with our internally developed software solutions our technology also includes a companywide network that connects all corporate users stores and our distribution infrastructure and provides communications for credit card and daily polling of sales and merchandise movement at the store level we intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems people and processes we update the technology supporting our stores distribution infrastructure and corporate headquarters on a regular basis we will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate our growth and enable us to enhance our competitive position 

intellectual property 

we have registered over 40 trademarks in the united states and other countries the majority of our trademark registrations contain the ulta mark including ulta salon cosmetics fragrance and design ultacom and ulta beauty and two related designs we maintain our marks on a docket system to monitor filing deadlines for renewal and continued validity all marks that are deemed material to our business have been applied for or registered in the united states and select foreign countries including canada 

we believe our trademarks especially those related to the ulta brand have significant value and are important to building brand recognition 

government regulation 

we are affected by extensive laws governmental regulations administrative determinations court decisions and similar constraints such laws regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal state or local levels in the united states many of the products we sell in our stores such as cosmetic dietary supplement food and overthecounter otc drugs medical devices and styling tools including our ulta branded products are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda the us federal trade commission ftc the consumer product safety commission cpsc state regulatory agencies and state attorneys general ags such regulations principally relate to the safety labeling manufacturing advertising packaging and distribution of the products 

products classified as cosmetics as defined in the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdc act are not subject to premarket approval by the fda but the products must generally be safe and must be properly manufactured and labeled certain products such as sunscreens and acne treatments are classified as otc drugs certain ingestible products such as vitamins and minerals are classified as dietary supplements both otc drugs and dietary supplements have specific ingredient labeling and manufacturing requirements the labeling of these products is subject to the requirements of the fdc act and the fair packaging and labeling act products such as wrinkle reducing lights may be classified as medical devices and in addition to being subject to labeling and 

  

manufacturing requirements may also be subject to premarketing review by the fda finally products such as styling tools eg blow dryers curling irons are regulated by the cpsc which has strict requirements with respect to reporting possible product defects 

further claims we make in advertising including claims about the safety or efficacy of products pricing claims and environmental claims are subject to regulation by the ftc and state ags who generally prohibit unfair or deceptive practices 

the government regulations that most impact our daytoday operations are the labor and employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject we are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws both federal and state our services business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements 

in our store leases we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use but at times the responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or buildouts that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or buildouts 

employees 

as of january 30 2016 we employed approximately 9700 people on a fulltime basis and approximately 16800 on a parttime basis we have no collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relationships with our employees 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentine’s day

 item 1a risk factors tableend investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or future growth could suffer in these circumstances the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 

the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally both in the us and internationally we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates tax rates the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or acute recession consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales 

in addition the continued volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while these declines have moderated the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession and economic conditions could lead to further declines in consumer spending in the future additionally there can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our vendor partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons ecommerce businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our guests’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 20000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest employee company andor business partners’ information damage our reputation and expose us to liability which could negatively impact our business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect process and store sensitive and confidential data including our proprietary business information and that of our guests suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches attacks by hackers acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our business products and services which could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our newly opened and to be opened distribution centers may not be adequate to support our historical growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we currently operate four distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in 2014 we began a multiyear supply chain project which focuses on among other things adding capacity and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities in order to support our historical and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business it is likely additional distribution centers will be added in the future we opened our fourth distribution center in august 2015 and expect to open our fifth in 2016 our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our newly opened distribution center and our distribution center to be opened in 2016 could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales may decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

   

  

  

 if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock may decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

our ecommerce business may be unsuccessful 

we offer most of our beauty products for sale through our website as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our participation in both ecommerce and physical store sales is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new 

  

customers supporting product offerings through both of these channels could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce business successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing guests rather than new guests who choose to purchase products from us online rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products in addition offering products through our internet channel could cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors as we continue to grow our ecommerce business the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests of conflicts between product offerings online and through our stores and of opening up our channels to increased internet competition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our longrange strategic and financial plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans or longrange strategic imperatives and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future our continued expansion places increased demands on our financial managerial operational supplychain and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems or any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems including management supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions to effectively manage our business we have also identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support historical and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products the processing of transactions our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders andor the reporting of financial results 

our ecommerce operations are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta beauty’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta beauty brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our ulta branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use 

  

overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we may respond by increasing markdowns initiating marketing promotions or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendor partners to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendor partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements with vendor partners and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendor partners our business depends to a significant extent on the 

  

willingness and ability of our vendor partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendor partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendor partners or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendor partners of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

during fiscal 2015 merchandise supplied to ulta beauty by our top ten vendor partners accounted for approximately 50 of our net sales there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendor partners or by any of our other vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta” “all things beauty all in one place tm ” and other marks incorporating our name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including ulta branded products and gifts with purchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta beauty including the ulta beauty collection and ulta branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta branded products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including fda ftc cpsc and state ags if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta branded products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties claims or product recalls which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta branded products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state requirements when we advertise our products including prices or services or engage in other promotional activities in digital including social media television or print may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior build out of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire 

  

inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes any such increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ulta branded products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta branded products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors andor ulta branded products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which could reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in december 2018 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 020 the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or subject us to fines or other penalties 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 

  

litigation costs and the outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses 

from time to time we are subject to litigation claims in the ordinary course of our business operations regarding but not limited to employment matters security of consumer and employee personal information contractual relations with suppliers marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties may be necessary which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we establish accruals for potential liability arising from legal proceedings when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability in addition actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter or in the aggregate an unfavorable resolution of a legal proceeding or claim could materially adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

management does not believe the nature of any pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows however management’s assessment may change at any time based upon the discovery of facts or circumstances that are presently not known to us therefore there can be no assurance that any pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

there can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future 

we paid a special cash dividend on may 15 2012 any future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements capital expenditure requirements contractual restrictions anticipated cash needs provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

our previously announced stock repurchase programs and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

we may have in place from time to time a stock repurchase program any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions we may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers all things beauty all in one place tm  a compelling value proposition and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer in the united states and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics fragrance skin care products hair care products and salon services we focus on providing affordable indulgence to our guests by combining unmatched product breadth value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our business include our ability to offer our guests a unique combination of more than 20000 beauty products across the categories of prestige and mass cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as a fullservice salon in every store featuring hair skin and brow services our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories and convenience as our stores are predominantly located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our six strategic imperatives 1 acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests 2 differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels 3 offer relevant innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests 4 deliver exceptional services in three core areas hair skin health and brows 5 grow stores and ecommerce to reach and serve more guests and 6 invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies we believe that the expanding us beauty products and salon services industry the shift in distribution channel of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta beauty’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry 

  

comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable sales by opening new stores and by increasing sales in our ecommerce channel operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a more than 1200 store chain with a successful ecommerce business and competitive omnichannel capabilities 

global economic conditions 

economic conditions in the us continue to be uneven fiscal stress in europe and economic uncertainty in the us related to deficit issues potential tax increases and federal spending cuts have resulted in significant fluctuations in the financial markets while the us credit markets have stabilized and credit availability has improved compared to the recent recessionary period economic growth is expected to continue to be weak consumer spending habits are affected by levels of unemployment unsettled financial markets weakness in housing and real estate higher interest rates fuel and energy costs and consumer perception of economic conditions among others sudden negative changes in one or more of the factors that affect consumer spending could adversely affect consumer spending levels which could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our sales levels and financial performance 

basis of presentation 

we have determined the operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance we have combined our three operating segments retail stores salon services and ecommerce into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumers economic characteristics nature of products and distribution methods 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores and ecommerce sales are recorded based on delivery of merchandise to the guest merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

comparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period comparable sales include the company’s ecommerce business there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 

measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions supply chain improvements share repurchases and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand shortterm investments and cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 

 

 operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

merchandise inventories were 7618 million at january 30 2016 compared to 5812 million at january 31 2015 representing an increase of 1806 million or 311 average inventory per store increased 161 compared to prior year the increase in inventory is primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 we had a current tax liability of 127 million at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to 194 million at the end of fiscal 2014 the decrease in taxes payable is primarily due to an increase in tax deductible stock option exercises and a decrease in state taxes 

deferred rent liabilities were 3218 million at january 30 2016 an increase of 277 million compared to 2941 million at january 31 2015 deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is primarily due to the addition of 100 net new stores opened since january 31 2015 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores supply chain investments shortterm investments and investments in information technology systems investment activities for capital expenditures 

  

were 2992 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 2491 million and 2260 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to investments in information technology systems merchandise fixtures and supply chain initiatives during 2015 during fiscal 2015 we opened 103 new stores remodeled four stores and relocated five stores compared to 100 new stores nine remodels and two relocations during fiscal 2014 and 127 new stores seven remodels and four relocations during fiscal 2013 during fiscal 2015 the average investment required to open a new ulta store was approximately 12 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables the average investment required to remodel an ulta beauty store was also approximately 12 million purchases of shortterm investments were 130 million during fiscal 2015 and consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 and planned fiscal 2016 by major category are as follows 

 

 our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new relocated and remodeled stores supply chain investments and information technology systems that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we expect to selffund future capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately 391 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 in 2016 new remodeled and relocated stores and merchandising capital expenditure increases reflect the expansion of prestige boutiques and related instore merchandising upgrades in 2014 we embarked on a multiyear supply chain project which included adding capacity with a fourth distribution center launched in august 2015 in greenwood indiana a fifth distribution center expected to open in 2016 in dallas texas and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax effects and our stock repurchase program purchase of treasury shares in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs

credit facility 

on october 19 2011 we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo capital finance llc as a lender jp morgan securities llc as a lender jp morgan chase bank na as a lender and pnc bank national association as a lender the loan agreement amended and restated the loan and security agreement dated as of august 31 2010 by and among the company and the lenders the loan agreement extended the maturity of the company’s credit facility to october 2016 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 200 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory contains a 10 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 50 million  subject to consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all times

as of january 30 2016 and january 31 2015 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also 

  

affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentine’s day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our potential future debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 30 2016 we have not entered into any “offbalance sheet” arrangements as that term is described by the sec we do however have offbalance sheet operating leases and purchases obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business as indicated within the contractual obligations table below 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of january 30 2016 

 

  

 we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2028 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services excluded from our purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business the amount of purchase obligations relates to commitments made to a third party for products and services for a future distribution center for which a lease has been signed advertising and other goods and service contracts entered into as of january 30 2016 

as of january 30 2016 the unrecognized tax benefit was 23 million which is not included in the above table due to uncertainty regarding the realization and timing of the related future cash flows if any 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market or shrink reserves adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 an increase or decrease in the lower of cost or market reserve of 10 would have had no material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2015 an increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10 would have had no material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2015 

vendor allowances 

the majority of cash consideration received from a supplier is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors’ products we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in net receivables at the amount we expect to collect we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory an increase or decrease in inventory turns of 5 basis points would have affected pretax income by approximately 33 million in fiscal 2015 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future 

  

estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges we have not recorded any significant impairment charges in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

customer loyalty program 

we maintain a customer loyalty program ultamate rewards in which program members earn points based on purchases points earned by members are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell we accrue the cost of anticipated redemptions related to this program at the time of the initial purchase based on historical experience we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our redemption rates adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 if our redemption rate were to increase or decrease by 5 it would have affected pretax income by approximately 41 million in fiscal 2015 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s common stock the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding the expected life of options granted is derived from historical data on ulta beauty stock option exercises the historical exercise data is updated on an annual basis and the changes have not had a material impact on the calculation in any years presented 

forfeitures of options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of the company’s stock option activity and reduce the compensation expense recognized the forfeiture rate is updated on an annual basis and the changes have not had a material impact on compensation expense recognized in any years presented we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our grant date fair value of stock options or forfeiture rate 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements “summary of significant accounting policies – sharebased compensation” for disclosure related to the company’s stock compensation expense see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions

we believe our trademarks especially those related to the ulta brand have significant value and are important to building brand recognition 

government regulation 

we are affected by extensive us laws governmental regulations administrative determinations court decisions and similar constraints such laws regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal state or local levels in the united states many of the products we sell in our stores such as cosmetic dietary supplement food and overthecounter otc drug products including our ulta branded products are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda the us federal trade commission ftc state regulatory agencies and state attorneys general ag such regulations principally relate to the safety of ingredients proper labeling manufacturing advertising packaging and distribution of the products 

products classified as cosmetics as defined in the federal food drug and cosmetic fdc act are not subject to premarket approval by the fda but the products must generally be safe and must be properly manufactured and labeled certain products such as sunscreens and acne treatments are classified as otc drugs and certain ingestible products such as vitamins and minerals are classified as dietary supplements both otc drugs and dietary supplements have specific ingredient labeling and manufacturing requirements the labeling of these products is subject to the requirements of the fdc act and the fair packaging and labeling act further claims we make in advertising including claims about the safety or efficacy of products pricing claims and environmental claims are subject to regulation by the ftc and state ags who generally prohibit deceptive practices 

the government regulations that most impact our daytoday operations are the labor and employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject we are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws both federal and state our services business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements 

in our store leases we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use but at times the responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping 

  

centers in which our stores are located we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or buildouts that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or buildouts

 item 1a risk factors tableend investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this form 10k before making an investment decision if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or future growth could suffer in these circumstances the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 

the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition the recent global economic crisis and volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally both in the us and internationally concerns over inflation employment tax laws energy costs healthcare costs geopolitical issues terrorism the availability and cost of credit the mortgage market sovereign and private banking systems sovereign deficits and increasing debt burdens and the real estate and other financial markets in the us and europe have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the us and certain foreign economies we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services continued uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates tax rates the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or acute recession consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales 

in addition the recent global economic crisis and volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while these declines have moderated the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession and economic conditions could lead to further declines in consumer spending in the future additionally there can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

recent economic conditions have also resulted in a tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions which is a source of capital for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending while global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from extreme disruptions experienced over the past few years uncertainty about continuing economic stability remains it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue the extent to which they will continue to recover if at all and which aspects of our products or business may be adversely affected current market and credit conditions could continue to make it more difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary credit to build new retail centers a significant decrease in new retail center development could limit our future growth opportunities as long as the aforementioned conditions exist 

  

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our product vendors as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons ecommerce businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we operate three distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in order to support our recent and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business additional distribution centers will be added in the future in 2014 we began a multiyear supply chain project which includes adding additional capacity including two additional distribution centers expected to open in 2015 and 2016 and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 20000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations despite our security measures our information 

  

technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our business products and services which could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we employ it security and securityrelated products and services as well as a fulltime staff to proactively monitor our systems and networks we maintain continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information and are in compliance with all applicable data protection laws and regulations 

unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer associate or company information could damage our reputation expose us to litigation and negatively impact our business 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate information as part of our normal course of business we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any security breach of customer associate or company confidential information could result in damage to our reputation and result in lost sales litigation fines or additional investments to fix or replace the systems that were breached any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales will decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team mary dillon was appointed chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors effective july 1 2013 and scott settersten was appointed chief financial officer and assistant secretary effective march 12 2013 if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

  

our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock may decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

our ecommerce business may be unsuccessful 

we offer many of our beauty products for sale through our website as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our participation in both ecommerce and physical store sales is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers supporting product offerings through both of these channels could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce business successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing customers rather than new customers who choose to purchase products from us online rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products in addition offering products through our internet channel could cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors as we continue to grow our ecommerce business the impact of attracting existing rather than new customers of conflicts between product offerings online and through our stores and of opening up our channels to increased internet competition could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows including future growth 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our longrange strategic and financial plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that 

  

we will be successful in implementing our growth plans or longrange strategic imperatives and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future our continued expansion places increased demands on our financial managerial operational supplychain and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our ecommerce business we have identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations shipment of goods ability to process financial information and credit card transactions and our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders or engage in normal business activities moreover security breaches or leaks of proprietary information including leaks of customers’ private data could result in liability decrease customer confidence in our company and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ecommerce operations are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems across our operations including for management supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security reliability and capacity of these systems information technology system failures network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations causing delays or cancellation of customer orders or impeding the manufacture or shipment of products processing of transactions or reporting of financial results an attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our customers or employees which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our gifts with purchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties 

  

tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may respond by increasing markdowns initiating marketing promotions or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income this risk is more pronounced during the recent economic downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers filing for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed consumer spending levels 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendors were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements with vendors and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing 

  

popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

during fiscal 2014 merchandise supplied to ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 50 of our net sales there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta” and other marks incorporating that name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and gifts with purchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and gifts with purchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of 

  

our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in march 2010 comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education and affordability reconciliation act collectively the “acts” was passed and signed into law this healthcare reform legislation significantly expands healthcare coverage to many uninsured individuals and to those already insured due to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation and the staggered implementation and uncertain timing of the regulations and lack of interpretive guidance it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the healthcare reform legislation on our business over the coming years possible adverse effects include increased costs exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business for example the patient protection and affordable care act has imposed new mandates on employers including a requirement effective january 1 2014 which has been extended to january 1 2015 due to a recent executive order that employers with 50 or more fulltime employees provide “credible” health insurance to employees or pay a financial penalty given our current health plan design and assuming the law is implemented without significant changes these mandates could materially increase our costs moreover if we choose to opt out of offering health insurance to our employees we may become less attractive as an employer and it may be harder for us to compete for qualified employees additionally because significant provisions of the acts will become effective on various dates over the next several years future changes could significantly impact any effects on our business that we previously anticipated 

 

  

  

 in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including the fda the ftc and state attorneys general in the united states if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties or claims which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our ulta product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising by us may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords 

  

generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior build out of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes which increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources further we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment in which case our creditors could levy against our assets these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the 

  

european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which will reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in december 2018 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 020 the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

we may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy and we may be unable to raise capital when needed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

from time to time we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth strategy in addition if general economic financial or political conditions in our markets change or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs if financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer 

  

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses 

reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a strain on our financial and management systems processes and controls as well as on our personnel in addition as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as a result we have been required to improve our financial and managerial controls reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be 

  

posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or subject us to fines or other penalties 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 

litigation costs and the outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation claims through the ordinary course of our business operations regarding but not limited to employment matters security of consumer and employee personal information contractual relations with suppliers marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties may be necessary which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we establish accruals for potential liability arising from legal proceedings when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information we may still incur legal costs 

  

for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability in addition actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter or in the aggregate an unfavorable resolution of a legal proceeding or claim could materially adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

management does not believe the nature of any pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows however management’s assessment may change at any time based upon the discovery of facts or circumstances that are presently not known to us therefore there can be no assurance that any pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

there can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future 

we paid a special cash dividend on may 15 2012 any future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements capital expenditure requirements contractual restrictions anticipated cash needs provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant we may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to pay dividends on our common stock 

our previously announced stock repurchase program and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

we may have in place from time to time a stock repurchase program any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass 

  

products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we developed a unique specialty retail concept by combining onestop shopping a compelling value proposition convenient locations and a welcoming shopping environment we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides onestop shopping for prestige mass and salon products and salon services in the united states we focus on providing affordable indulgence to our guests by combining unmatched product breadth value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our business include our ability to offer our guests a unique combination of more than 20000 beauty products across the categories of prestige and mass cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools we also offer a fullservice salon and a wide range of salon haircare products in all of our stores we focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories our stores are predominantly located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our six strategic imperatives 1 acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests 2 differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels 3 offer relevant innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests 4 deliver exceptional services in three core areas hair skin health and brows 5 grow stores and ecommerce to reach and serve more guests and 6 invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies we believe that the expanding us beauty products and salon services industry the shift in distribution channel of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry 

comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable sales by opening new stores and by increasing sales in our ecommerce channel operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a 1200 store chain with a successful ecommerce business and competitive omnichannel capabilities 

global economic conditions 

economic conditions in the us continue to be uneven fiscal stress in europe and economic uncertainty in the us related to deficit issues potential tax increases and federal spending cuts have resulted in significant fluctuations in the financial markets while the us credit markets have stabilized and credit availability has improved compared to the recent recessionary period economic growth is expected to continue to be weak consumer spending habits are affected by levels of unemployment unsettled financial markets weakness in housing and real estate higher interest rates fuel and energy costs and consumer perception of economic conditions among others sudden negative changes in one or more of the factors that affect consumer spending could adversely affect consumer spending levels which could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our sales levels and financial performance 

basis of presentation 

we have determined the operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance we have combined our three operating segments retail stores salon services and ecommerce into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumer economic characteristics nature of products and distribution methods 

  

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores and ecommerce sales are recorded based on delivery of merchandise to the customer merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

comparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period comparable sales include the company’s ecommerce business there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 

measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results

preopening expense includes noncapital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new remodeled and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores store setup labor management and employee training and grand opening advertising 

interest expense includes interest costs and unused facility fees associated with our credit facility which is structured as an assetbased lending instrument our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates interest income represents interest from shortterm investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase 

income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion supply chain improvements share repurchases and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

  

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

 operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

merchandise inventories were 5812 million at january 31 2015 compared to 4579 million at february 1 2014 representing an increase of 1233 million or 269 average inventory per store increased 107 compared to prior year the increase in inventory is primarily due to the following 

 

  

 we had a current tax liability of 194 million at the end of fiscal 2014 compared to 153 million at the end of fiscal 2013 the increase in taxes payable is primarily due to an increase in taxable income 

deferred rent liabilities were 2941 million at january 31 2015 an increase of 325 million compared to the prior year end deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is primarily due to the addition of 99 net new stores opened since february 1 2014 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores supply chain investments shortterm investments and investments in information technology systems investment activities for capital expenditures were 2491 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 2260 million and 1886 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to investments in supply chain initiatives partially offset by the decrease in the number of new store openings during 2014 during fiscal 2014 we opened 100 new stores remodeled 9 stores and relocated 2 stores compared to 127 new stores 7 remodels and 4 relocations during fiscal 2013 and 102 new stores 21 remodels and 3 relocations during fiscal 2012 during fiscal 2014 the average investment required to open a new ulta store was approximately 11 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables the average investment required to remodel an ulta store was approximately 11 million purchases of shortterm investments were 1502 million during fiscal 2014 and consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase 

  

capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 and planned fiscal 2015 by major category are as follows 

 

 our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new relocated and remodeled stores supply chain investments and information technology systems that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we expect to selffund future capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately 297 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 in 2014 we embarked on a multiyear supply chain project which will include adding additional capacity including a fourth distribution center expected to open in 2015 a fifth distribution center expected to open in 2016 and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities the 2015 merchandising capital increase reflects expansion of prestige boutiques and related instore merchandising upgrades 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax effects a dividend payment and our stock repurchase program purchase of treasury shares in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs 

dividend 

on march 8 2012 we announced that our board of directors had declared a 100 per share special cash dividend to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 20 2012 the special cash dividend totaling 625 million was paid on may 15 2012 

our board of directors may determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow capital requirements current and future liquidity restrictions included as part of our credit facility as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time 

share repurchase plan 

on march 18 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program the 2013 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to 150 million of the company’s common stock repurchases pursuant to the 2013 share repurchase program were made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prices the company deemed appropriate and subject to market conditions applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the company’s sole discretion the 2013 share repurchase program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time 

on september 11 2014 we announced that our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program the 2014 share repurchase program pursuant to which the company may repurchase up to 300 million of the 

  

company’s common stock the 2014 share repurchase program authorization revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts of 1127 million from the 2013 share repurchase program the 2014 share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time on march 12 2015 we announced that our board of directors authorized an increase of 100 million to the 2014 share repurchase program effective march 17 2015

credit facility 

on october 19 2011 we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo capital finance llc as a lender jp morgan securities llc as a lender jp morgan chase bank na as a lender and pnc bank national association as a lender the loan agreement amended and restated the loan and security agreement dated as of august 31 2010 by and among the lenders the loan agreement extends the maturity of the company’s credit facility to october 2016 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 200000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory contains a 10000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 50000 subject to consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all times

as of january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentine’s day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our potential future debt 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 31 2015 we have not entered into any “offbalance sheet” arrangements as that term is described by the sec we do however have offbalance sheet operating leases and purchases obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business as indicated within the contractual obligations table below 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of january 31 2015 

 

  

 we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2027 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services the amount of purchase obligations relate to commitments made to a third party for products and services for future distribution centers for which a lease had been signed advertising and other goods and service contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business as of january 31 2015 

as of january 31 2015 the unrecognized tax benefit was 14 million which is not included in the above table due to uncertainty regarding the realization and timing of the related future cash flows if any 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related 

  

vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market or shrink reserves adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 a change in the lower of cost or market reserve of 10 would have had no material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2014 a change in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10 would have had no material impact on our pretax income for fiscal 2014 

vendor allowances 

the majority of cash consideration received from a supplier is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors’ products we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in net receivables at the amount we expect to collect we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory a change in inventory turns of 5 basis points would have affected pretax income by approximately 24 million in fiscal 2014 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges we have not recorded any significant impairment charges in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

customer loyalty program 

we maintain a customer loyalty program ultamate rewards in which program members earn points based on purchases points earned by members are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell we accrue the cost of anticipated redemptions related to this program at the time of the initial purchase based on historical experience we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our redemption rates if our redemption rate were to change by 5 it would have affected pretax income by approximately 32 million in fiscal 2014 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification tm asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

  

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model for fiscal 2014 and 2013 the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the ulta common shares the risk free interest rate was based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding for fiscal 2014 and 2013 the expected life of options granted was derived from historical data on ulta stock option exercises the historical exercise data is updated on an annual basis and the changes have not had a material impact on the calculation in any years presented during fiscal 2013 we made changes to update the valuation assumptions to company specific information these changes had no material impact on the calculation prior to 2013 we had limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on october 30 2007 as a result we elected to use the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin on sharebased payments and the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publiclytraded companies 

beginning in fiscal 2013 we introduced a forfeiture rate forfeitures of options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of the company’s stock option activity and reduce the compensation expense recognized the forfeiture rate is updated on an annual basis and the changes have not had a material impact on compensation expense recognized in any years presented we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our grant date fair value of stock options or forfeiture rate

in addition the recent global economic crisis and volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while these declines have moderated the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession and economic conditions could lead to further declines in consumer spending in the future additionally there can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

recent economic conditions have also resulted in a tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions which is a source of capital for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending while global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from extreme disruptions experienced over the past few years uncertainty about continuing economic stability remains it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue the extent to which they will continue to recover if at all and which aspects of our products or business may be adversely affected current market and credit conditions could continue to make it more difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary credit to build new retail centers a significant decrease in new retail center development could limit our future growth opportunities as long as the aforementioned conditions exist 

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our product vendors as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a 

  

number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry even when economic conditions are favorable we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons internet businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales will decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the regions in which we operate our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team mary dillon was appointed chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors effective july 1 2013 and scott settersten was appointed chief financial officer and assistant secretary effective march 12 2013 if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

  

our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock would likely decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully develop and implement our longrange strategic and financial plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows in addition we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our longrange strategic and financial plan and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis our senior management is currently evaluating our longrange strategic and financial plan to align and prioritize our growth strategies as well as additional investments that will be needed to support continued and future growth there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plan or longrange strategic initiatives and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows during fiscal 2013 we opened 127 new stores we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future and believe we have the longterm potential to grow our store base to approximately 1200 stores in the united states during fiscal 2013 the average investment required to open a typical new store was approximately 10 million our continued expansion places increased demands on our financial managerial operational supplychain and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we operate three distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in order to support our recent and expected future 

  

growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business additional distribution centers may need to be added in the future we are embarking on a multiyear supply chain project beginning in 2014 which will include adding additional capacity including a fourth distribution center expected to open in 2015 and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 20000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our ecommerce business we have identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations shipment of goods ability to process financial information and credit card transactions and our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders or engage in normal business activities moreover security breaches or leaks of proprietary information including leaks of customers’ private data could result in liability decrease customer confidence in our company and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ecommerce operations are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems across our operations including for management supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security reliability and capacity of these systems information technology system failures network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations causing delays or cancellation of customer orders or impeding the manufacture or shipment of products processing of transactions or reporting of financial results an attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our customers or employees which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation 

  

cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our business products and services which could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we employ it security and securityrelated products and services as well as a fulltime staff to proactively monitor our systems and networks we maintain continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information and are in compliance with all applicable data protection laws and regulations 

unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer associate or company information could damage our reputation expose us to litigation and negatively impact our business 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate information as part of our normal course of business we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any security breach of customer associate or company confidential information could result in damage to our reputation and result in lost sales litigation fines or additional investments to fix or replace the systems that were breached any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ecommerce business may be unsuccessful 

we offer many of our beauty products for sale through our website as a result we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website and software and other related operational systems although we believe that our participation in both ecommerce and physical store sales is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers supporting product offerings through both of these channels could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations for example if our ecommerce business successfully grows it may do so in part by attracting existing customers rather than new customers who choose to purchase products from us online rather than from our physical stores thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores in addition offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products in addition offering products through our internet channel could cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors as we continue to grow our ecommerce business the impact of attracting existing rather than new customers of conflicts between product offerings online and through our stores and of opening up our channels to increased internet competition could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows including future growth 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our giftwithpurchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports 

  

from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors which are beyond our control and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income this risk is more pronounced during the recent economic downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers filing for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed consumer spending levels 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendors were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors our business depends to a significant extent on the 

  

willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

during fiscal 2013 merchandise supplied to ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 51 of our net sales there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta” and other marks incorporating that name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate 

  

cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in march 2010 comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education and affordability reconciliation act collectively the “acts” was passed and signed into law this healthcare reform legislation significantly expands healthcare coverage to many uninsured individuals and to those already insured due to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation and the staggered implementation and uncertain timing of the regulations and lack of interpretive guidance it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the healthcare reform legislation on our business over the coming years possible adverse effects include increased costs exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business for example the patient protection and affordable care act has imposed new mandates on employers including a requirement effective january 1 2014 which has been extended to january 1 2015 due to a recent executive order that employers with 50 or more fulltime employees provide “credible” health insurance to employees or pay a financial penalty given our current health plan design and assuming the law is implemented without significant changes these mandates could materially increase our costs moreover if we choose to opt out of offering health insurance to our employees we may become less attractive as an employer and it may be harder for us to compete for qualified employees additionally because significant provisions of the acts will become effective on various dates over the next several years future changes could significantly impact any effects on our business that we previously anticipated 

 

  

  

 in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including the fda the ftc and state attorneys general in the united states if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties or claims which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our ulta product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising by us may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

  

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior build out of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes which increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources further we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment in which case our creditors could levy against our assets these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be 

  

prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we expect the net investment to open a new store in 2014 to increase due to increases in material and labor costs resulting from a stronger commercial and residential building environment compared to the last several years 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which will reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in december 2018 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 020 the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

  

we may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy and we may be unable to raise capital when needed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

from time to time we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth strategy in addition if general economic financial or political conditions in our markets change or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs if financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses 

reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a strain on our financial and management systems processes and controls as well as on our personnel in addition as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as a result we have been required to improve our financial and managerial controls reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

use of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties 

there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

we also use social media platforms as marketing tools for example we maintain facebook twitter and pinterest accounts as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices the failure by us our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or subject us to fines or other penalties 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 

  

litigation costs and the outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation claims through the ordinary course of our business operations regarding but not limited to employment matters security of consumer and employee personal information contractual relations with suppliers marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties may be necessary which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows we establish accruals for potential liability arising from legal proceedings when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability in addition actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter or in the aggregate an unfavorable resolution of a legal proceeding or claim could materially adversely impact our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

management does not believe the nature of any pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows however management’s assessment may change at any time based upon the discovery of facts or circumstances that are presently not known to us therefore there can be no assurance that any pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

there can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future 

we paid a special cash dividend on may 15 2012 any future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements capital expenditure requirements contractual restrictions anticipated cash needs provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant we may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to pay dividends on our common stock 

our previously announced stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

on march 18 2013 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prices that the company deems appropriate and subject to market conditions applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the company’s sole discretion up to an aggregate purchase price of 150 million the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions the program does not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time and any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we developed a unique specialty retail concept by combining onestop shopping a compelling value proposition convenient locations 

  

and a welcoming shopping environment we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides onestop shopping for prestige mass and salon products and salon services in the united states we focus on providing affordable indulgence to our customers by combining unmatched product breadth value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our business include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of more than 20000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as salon haircare products we focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories our stores are predominantly located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our five point growth strategy including growing stores to approximately 1200 locations expanding our offering by adding new products brands and services enhancing our loyalty program broadening our marketing reach and expanding our digital business we believe that the expanding us beauty products and salon services industry the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy 

comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable store sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable store sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people systems and supply chain required to support a 1200 store chain with a successful ecommerce business and competitive omnichannel capabilities we are currently evaluating our long range strategic and financial plan and expect to share our longterm growth plan and financial targets in the fall of 2014 

global economic conditions 

economic conditions in the us continue to be uneven fiscal stress in europe and economic uncertainty in the us related to deficit issues potential tax increases and federal spending cuts have resulted in significant fluctuations in the financial markets while the us credit markets have stabilized and credit availability has improved compared to the recent recessionary period economic growth is expected to continue to be weak consumer spending habits are affected by levels of unemployment unsettled financial markets weakness in housing and real estate higher interest rates fuel and energy costs and consumer perception of economic conditions among others sudden negative changes in one or more of the factors that affect consumer spending could adversely affect consumer spending levels which could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our sales levels and financial performance 

basis of presentation 

we have determined the operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance we have combined our three operating segments retail stores salon services and ecommerce into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumer economic characteristics nature of products and distribution methods 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores and ecommerce sales are recorded based on delivery of merchandise to the customer merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

  

comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period beginning with the first quarter of 2013 comparable store sales include the company’s ecommerce business there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 

measuring comparable store sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion supply chain improvements and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011

merchandise inventories were 4579 million at february 1 2014 compared to 3611 million at february 2 2013 representing an increase of 968 million or 268 average inventory per store increased 33 compared to prior year the increase in inventory is primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 we had a current tax liability of 153 million at the end of fiscal 2013 compared to 101 million at the end of fiscal 2012 the increase in taxes payable is primarily due to an increase in taxable income 

deferred rent liabilities were 2616 million at february 1 2014 an increase of 536 million compared to the prior year end deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is primarily due to the addition of 125 net new stores opened since february 2 2013 

the 187 million cash flow benefit from income taxes is attributed to federal income tax deductions due to accelerated depreciation on fixed assets and tax deductible stock option exercises 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems investment activities for capital expenditures were 2260 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 1886 million and 1286 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the increase in our 2013 new store program during fiscal 2013 we opened 127 new stores remodeled 7 stores and relocated 4 stores compared to 102 new stores 21 remodels and 3 relocations during fiscal 2012 and 61 new stores 17 remodels and 2 relocations during fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2013 the average investment required to open a new ulta store was approximately 10 million which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables the average investment required to remodel an ulta store was approximately 12 million 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 and planned fiscal 2014 by major category are as follows 

 

 our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new relocated and remodeled stores supply chain investments and information technology systems that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures based on past performance and current expectations we expect to selffund future capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately 265 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 we expect to spend less on new remodeled and relocated stores with our plan to open approximately 100 new stores and remodel approximately 12 stores in fiscal 2014 compared to 127 new stores and 17 remodels in fiscal 2013 this decrease 

  

will be offset by expected increases in supply chain expenditures we are embarking on a multiyear supply chain project beginning in 2014 which will include adding additional capacity including a fourth distribution center expected to open in 2015 and system improvements to support expanded omnichannel capabilities 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax effects a dividend payment and our stock repurchase program purchase of treasury shares in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs 

dividend 

on march 8 2012 we announced that our board of directors had declared a 100 per share special cash dividend to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 20 2012 the special cash dividend totaling 625 million was paid on may 15 2012 

our board of directors may determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow capital requirements current and future liquidity restrictions included as part of our credit facility as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time 

stock repurchase plan 

on march 18 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company may repurchase up to 150 million of the company’s common stock the repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prices that the company deems appropriate and subject to market conditions applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the company’s sole discretion the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal 2013 we purchased 500500 shares of common stock for 373 million at an average price of 7458 

credit facility 

on october 19 2011 we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo capital finance llc as a lender jp morgan securities llc as a lender jp morgan chase bank na as a lender and pnc bank national association as a lender the loan agreement amended and restated the loan and security agreement dated as of august 31 2010 by and among the lenders the loan agreement extends the maturity of the company’s credit facility to october 2016 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 200000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory contains a 10000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 50000 subject to consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all times

borrowings under the facility outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 020 

as of february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 we had no borrowings outstanding under its credit facility and the company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentine’s day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations we do not have any noncancelable purchase commitments as of february 1 2014 

contractual obligations 

we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2027 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of february 1 2014 

 

  

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 

vendor allowances 

we deem a cash consideration received from a supplier to be a reduction of the cost of products sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products the majority of cash consideration received by the company is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold any portion of such cash consideration received that is attributable to inventory on hand is reflected as a reduction of inventory we consider the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors in order to determine the appropriate classification of amounts received in the consolidated statements of income we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in net receivables at the amount we expect to collect 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification tm asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

  

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model during fiscal 2013 we made changes to update the valuation assumptions to company specific information these changes had no material impact on the calculation for fiscal 2013 the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the ulta common shares the risk free interest rate was based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding for fiscal 2013 the expected life of options granted was derived from historical data on ulta stock option exercises prior to 2013 we had limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on october 30 2007 as a result we elected to use the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin on sharebased payments and the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publiclytraded companies beginning in fiscal 2013 we introduced a forfeiture rate forfeitures of options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of the company’s stock option activity and reduce the compensation expense recognized 

see notes to consolidated financial statements “summary of significant accounting policies — sharebased compensation” for disclosure related to the company’s stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products after extensive research we recognized an opportunity to better satisfy how women want to shop for beauty products we developed a unique retail approach by combining onestop shopping a compelling value proposition convenient locations and an uplifting specialty retail experience while we are currently executing on the core elements of our business strategy we plan to continually refine our approach in order to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are critical to our continuing success 

differentiated merchandising strategy with broad appeal we believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories price points and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our customers while the products we sell can be found in department stores specialty stores salons drug stores and mass merchandisers we offer all of these products in one retail format so that our customer can find everything she needs in one shopping trip we appeal to a wide range of customers by offering over 500 brands such as bare minerals and urban decay cosmetics chanel and estée lauder fragrances redken and matrix haircare as well as dermalogica and philosophy skincare and clarisonic and hot tools personal care appliances we also offer private label ulta products in key categories such as cosmetics skin care and bath because we offer a broad array of products in prestige mass and salon we appeal to a wide range of customers including women of all ages demographics and lifestyles 

our unique customer experience we combine unmatched product breadth value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer we cater to the woman who loves to indulge in shopping for beauty products as well as the woman who is time constrained and comes to the store knowing exactly what she wants our distribution infrastructure consistently delivers an instock rate of greater than 95 allowing our customers to find the products they are looking for our welltrained beauty advisors are not commissionbased and therefore can provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to our customers’ needs our customer service strategy store locations layout and design create a unique shopping experience which we believe increases both the frequency and length of our customers’ visits 

retail format poised to benefit from shifting channel dynamics over the past several years the approximately 100 billion beauty products and salon services industry has experienced significant changes including a shift in how manufacturers distribute and customers purchase beauty products this has enabled the specialty retail channel to grow at a greater rate than the industry overall since at least 2000 we are capitalizing on these trends by offering a primarily offmall serviceoriented specialty retail concept with a comprehensive product mix across categories and price points 

loyal and active customer base approximately eleven million ulta customers are members of our loyalty programs we utilize this valuable proprietary database to drive traffic better understand our customers’ purchasing patterns and support new store site selection we regularly employ a broad range of media including digital catalogs and newspaper inserts to drive traffic to our stores as well as entertain and educate our customers 

strong vendor relationships across product categories we have strong active relationships with over 300 vendors including estée lauder bare minerals coty l’oréal and procter  gamble we believe the scope of these relationships which span the three distinct beauty categories of prestige mass and salon and which have taken years to develop create a significant impediment for other retailers to replicate our model we work closely with our vendors to market both new and existing brands in a collaborative manner 

experienced management team  we have an experienced senior management team with extensive retail experience that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business we continue to expand the depth of our management team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our growth strategy

we believe our trademarks especially those related to the ulta brand have significant value and are important to building brand recognition 

government regulation 

in our us markets we are affected by extensive laws governmental regulations administrative determinations court decisions and similar constraints such laws regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal state or local levels in the united states the cosmetic dietary supplement food and overthecounter otc drug products we sell in our stores including our ulta branded products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration fda the federal trade commission ftc and state attorneys general ag in the united states such regulations principally relate to the safety of ingredients proper labeling manufacturing advertising packaging and distribution of the products 

products classified as cosmetics as defined in the food drug and cosmetic fdc act are not subject to premarket approval by the fda but the products and the ingredients must generally be safe and must be properly manufactured and labeled certain products such as sunscreens and acne treatments are classified as otc drugs and certain ingestible products such as vitamins and minerals are classified as dietary supplements both otc drugs and dietary supplements have specific ingredients labeling and manufacturing requirements the labeling of these products is subject to the requirements of the fdc act and the fair packaging and labeling act further claims we make in advertising including claims about the safety or efficacy of products pricing claims and environmental claims are subject to regulation by the ftc and state ag’s who generally prohibit deceptive practices 

the government regulations that most impact our daytoday operations are the labor and employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject we are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws both federal and state our salon business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon procedures 

in our store leases we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use but at times the responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or buildouts that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or buildouts

 item 1a risk factors tableend investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this form 10k before making an investment decision if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or future growth could suffer in these circumstances the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

the global economic crisis and volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets as well as declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the global economic crisis and volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions have led to decreases in consumer spending across the economy increases in the levels of unemployment energy costs healthcare costs and taxes combined with tighter credit markets reduced consumer confidence and other factors contribute to the decline in consumer spending while this decline has moderated the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession and economic conditions could lead to further declines in consumer spending in the future we offer a wide selection of beauty products and premium salon services continued uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact levels of consumer discretionary spending across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services additionally there can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of inventory purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

economic conditions have also resulted in a tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions which is a source of capital for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending while global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from extreme disruptions experienced over the past few years uncertainty about continuing economic stability remains it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue the extent to which they will continue to recover if at all and which aspects of our products or business may be adversely affected current market and credit conditions could continue to make it more difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary credit to build new retail centers a significant decrease in new retail center development has adversely affected our new store program and could limit our future growth opportunities as long as the aforementioned conditions exist continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies and declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs and could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our product vendors as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry even when economic conditions are favorable we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons internet businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales will decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the regions in which we operate our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of other key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

effective february 21 2013 carl s rubin resigned from his position as president and chief executive officer and dennis k eck a current board member is currently serving as interim chief executive officer until a 

  

permanent replacement is identified in addition scott m settersten served as acting chief financial officer and assistant secretary of the company from october 18 2012 through march 12 2013 at which time we announced his appointment as permanent chief financial officer and assistant secretary we are in the process of completing a comprehensive search for a permanent chief executive officer however there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and hire a qualified candidate in a timely manner our ability to attract select and hire a permanent chief executive officer candidate may prove difficult take more time than anticipated and be costly this may require other senior management to divert part of their attention from their primary duties which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operations our inability to effectively manage and maintain our business through this chief executive officer transition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis during fiscal 2012 we opened 102 new stores we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future and believe we have the longterm potential to grow our store base to approximately 1200 stores in the united states during fiscal 2012 the average investment required to open a typical new store was approximately 10 million this continued expansion could place increased demands on our financial managerial operational and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we operate three distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in order to support our recent and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business additional distribution centers may need to be added in the future our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 20000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our ecommerce business we have identified the need to 

  

expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations shipment of goods ability to process financial information and credit card transactions and our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders or engage in normal business activities moreover security breaches or leaks of proprietary information including leaks of customers’ private data could result in liability decrease customer confidence in our company and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ecommerce operations are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems could materially affect our operations 

we rely on information technology systems across our operations including for management supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security reliability and capacity of these systems information technology system failures network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations causing delays or cancellation of customer orders or impeding the manufacture or shipment of products processing of transactions or reporting of financial results an attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our customers or employees which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation 

unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer associate or company information could damage out reputation expose us to litigation and negatively impact our business 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate information as part of our normal course of business we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any security breach of customer associate or company confidential information could result in damage to our reputation and result in lost sales litigation fines or additional investments to fix or replace the systems that were breached any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our giftwithpurchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing 

  

goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors which are beyond our control and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income this risk is more pronounced during the current economic downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers filing for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed consumer spending levels 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendors were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could 

  

negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

during fiscal 2012 merchandise supplied to ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 53 of our net sales there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta” and other marks incorporating that name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply 

  

with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions profitability and cash flows 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including the fda the ftc and state attorneys general in the united states if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties or claims which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our ulta product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising by us may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior buildout of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the 

  

shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes which increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources further we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment in which case our creditors could levy against our assets these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which will reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring october 2016 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 0225 the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

we may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy and we may be unable to raise capital when needed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

from time to time we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth strategy in addition if general economic financial or political conditions in our markets change or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs if financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses 

reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems processes and controls as well as on our personnel in addition as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as a result we have been required to improve our 

  

financial and managerial controls reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of other factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock would likely decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future 

we paid a special cash dividend on may 15 2012 any future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements capital expenditure requirements contractual restrictions anticipated cash needs provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant we may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to pay dividends on our common stock 

  

our previously announced stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

on march 18 2013 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prices that the company deems appropriate and subject to market conditions applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the company’s sole discretion up to an aggregate purchase price of 150 million the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions the program does not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time and any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products after extensive research we recognized an opportunity to better satisfy how women want to shop for beauty products we developed a unique retail approach by combining onestop shopping a compelling value proposition convenient locations and an uplifting specialty retail experience we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance 

  

  

we are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides onestop shopping for prestige mass and salon products and salon services in the united states we focus on providing affordable indulgence to our customers by combining unmatched product breadth value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our business include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of over 20000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as salon styling tools we focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories our stores are predominately located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our growth strategy including accelerating store growth introducing new products services and brands enhancing our loyalty program broadening our marketing reach increasing our digital focus including ultacom and improving our operating margin we believe that the expanding us beauty products and salon services industry the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy 

comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable store sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others we do not expect our 88 fiscal 2012 comparable store sales increase to continue into the future our longterm annual comparable store sales increase target is 4 to 6 including the impact of ecommerce sales starting in 2013 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our supply chain infrastructure and fixed store costs with comparable store sales increases and operating efficiencies we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and decreasing our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales 

global economic conditions 

economic conditions in the us continue to be uneven fiscal stress in europe and economic uncertainty in the us related to deficit issues potential tax increases and federal spending cuts have resulted in significant fluctuations in the financial markets while the us credit markets have stabilized and credit availability has improved compared to the recent recessionary period economic growth is expected to continue to be weak consumer spending habits are affected by levels of unemployment unsettled financial markets weakness in housing and real estate higher interest rates fuel and energy costs and consumer perception of economic conditions among others sudden negative changes in one or more of the factors that affect consumer spending could adversely affect consumer spending levels which could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our sales levels and financial performance 

basis of presentation 

the company has determined its operating segments on the same basis that it uses to internally evaluate performance we have combined our three operating segments retail stores salon services and ecommerce into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumer economic characteristics nature of products and distribution methods 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores and the time of shipment in the case of internet sales merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of 

  

operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period ecommerce merchandise sales are excluded from comparable store sales starting in the first quarter of 2013 comparable store sales will be reported including the company’s ecommerce business there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 

measuring comparable store sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

merchandise inventories were 3611 million at february 2 2013 compared to 2446 million at january 28 2012 representing an increase of 1165 million average inventory per store increased 205 compared to prior year the increase in inventory is due to the addition of 101 net new stores opened since january 28 2012 and incremental inventory related to the recently added prestige brand boutiques as well as strategic inventory investments to improve instock levels 

we had a current tax liability of 101 million at the end of fiscal 2012 compared to 40 million at the end of fiscal 2011 the increase in taxes payable is primarily due to an increase in taxable income 

deferred rent liabilities were 2080 million at february 2 2013 an increase of 445 million compared to the prior year end deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is primarily due to the addition of 101 net new stores opened since january 28 2012 

the 534 million cash flow benefit from income taxes is attributed to federal income tax deductions due to accelerated bonus depreciation on fixed assets and tax deductible stock option exercises 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures were 1886 million in fiscal 

  

2012 compared to 1286 million and 971 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to the increase in our 2012 new store program during fiscal 2012 we opened 102 new stores remodeled 21 stores and relocated 3 stores compared to 61 new stores 17 remodels and 2 relocations during fiscal 2011 and 47 new stores 13 remodels and 5 relocations during fiscal 2010 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax effects and a dividend payment common stock repurchased in fiscal 2012 and 2011 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs 

dividend 

on march 8 2012 we announced that our board of directors had declared a 100 per share special cash dividend to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 20 2012 the special cash dividend totaling 625 million was paid on may 15 2012 

our board of directors may determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow capital requirements current and future liquidity restrictions included as part of our credit facility as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time 

credit facility 

on october 19 2011 the company entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo capital finance llc as a lender jp morgan securities llc as a lender jp morgan chase bank na as a lender and pnc bank national association as a lender the loan agreement amended and restated the loan and security agreement dated as of august 31 2010 by and among the lenders the loan agreement extends the maturity of the company’s credit facility to october 2016 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 200000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory contains a 10000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 50000 subject to consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all times substantially all of the company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 0225 

on september 5 2012 we entered into amendment no 1 to the amended and restated loan and security agreement the amendment with the lender group the amendment updated certain administrative terms and conditions and provides us greater flexibility to take certain corporate actions there were no changes to the revolving loan amounts available interest rates covenants or maturity date under terms of the loan agreement 

as of february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 the company had no borrowings outstanding under its credit facility and the company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentine’s day any decrease in sales 

  

during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations and letters of credit we do not have any noncancelable purchase commitments as of february 2 2013 

contractual obligations 

we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2027 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of february 2 2013 

 

  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the store level which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification tm asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on volatilities of our stock and a peer group of publiclytraded companies the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding we have limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on october 30 2007 as a result we have elected to use the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin on sharebased payments 

see notes to financial statements “summary of significant accounting policies — sharebased compensation” for disclosure related to the company’s stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions see note 9 to our financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowing under our credit facility interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates we did not utilize the credit facility during fiscal 2012

our value proposition   we believe our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories is fundamental to our customer loyalty for example we run frequent promotions and coupons for our mass brands giftwithpurchase offers and multiproduct gift sets for our prestige brands and a comprehensive customer loyalty program 

an offmall location   our stores are predominately located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers our typical store is approximately 10000 square feet including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our fullservice salon our displays store design and open layout allow us the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy 

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products after extensive research we recognized an opportunity to better satisfy how a woman wanted to shop for beauty products this 

  

led to what we believe to be a unique retail approach that focuses on all aspects of how women prefer to shop for beauty products by combining the fundamental elements of a beauty superstore including onestop shopping a compelling value proposition and convenient locations together with an uplifting specialty retail experience while we are currently executing on the core elements of our business strategy we plan to continually refine our approach in order to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are critical to our continuing success 

differentiated merchandising strategy with broad appeal we believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories price points and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our customers while the products we sell can be found in department stores specialty stores salons drug stores and mass merchandisers we offer all of these products in one retail format so that our customer can find everything she needs in one shopping trip we appeal to a wide range of customers by offering over 500 brands such as bare escentuals cosmetics chanel and estée lauder fragrances l’oréal haircare and cosmetics and paul mitchell haircare we also have private label ulta offerings in key categories because our offerings span a broad array of product categories in prestige mass and salon we appeal to a wide range of customers including women of all ages demographics and lifestyles 

our unique customer experience we combine the value and convenience of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer we cater to the woman who loves to indulge in shopping for beauty products as well as the woman who is time constrained and comes to the store knowing exactly what she wants our distribution infrastructure consistently delivers an instock rate of greater than 95 so our customers know they will find the products they are looking for our welltrained beauty consultants are not commissionbased and therefore can provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to our customers’ needs together with our customer service strategy our store locations layout and design help create our unique retail shopping experience which we believe increases both the frequency and length of our customers’ visits 

retail format poised to benefit from shifting channel dynamics  over the past several years the approximately 93 billion beauty products and salon services industry has experienced significant changes including a shift in how manufacturers distribute and customers purchase beauty products this has enabled the specialty retail channel in which we operate to grow at a greater rate than the industry overall since at least 2000 we are capitalizing on these trends by offering a primarily offmall serviceoriented specialty retail concept with a comprehensive product mix across categories and price points 

loyal and active customer base  we have over nine million customer loyalty program members we utilize this valuable proprietary database to drive traffic better understand our customers’ purchasing patterns and support new store site selection we employ a broad range of media including digital catalogs and newspaper inserts to entertain and educate our customers and most importantly to drive traffic to our stores 

strong vendor relationships across product categories we have strong active relationships with over 300 vendors including estée lauder bare escentuals coty l’oréal and procter  gamble we believe the scope and extent of these relationships which span the three distinct beauty categories of prestige mass and salon and have taken years to develop create a significant impediment for other retailers to replicate our model these relationships also frequently afford us the opportunity to work closely with our vendors to market both new and existing brands in a collaborative manner 

experienced management team  we have an experienced senior management team with extensive retail experience that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business we continue to expand the depth of our management team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our growth strategy 

growth strategy 

we intend to expand our presence as a leading retailer of beauty products and salon services by pursuing the following primary growth strategies 

accelerate pace of new store expansion and grow to over 1000 stores in the united states  we continue to believe that over the longterm we have the potential to grow our store base to over 1000 ulta stores in the 

  

united states our internal real estate model takes into account a number of variables including demographic and sociographic data as well as population density relative to maximum drive times economic and competitive factors we plan to continue opening stores both in markets in which we currently operate and new markets as the economy continues to recover we have been successful in opening new stores in diverse markets across the united states allowing us to increase our new store growth rates back to historical levels consistent with our longterm target of 15 to 20 

we opened 61 new stores during fiscal 2011 representing a 16 increase in square footage growth and a 30 increase in the number of new stores opened compared to 47 in fiscal 2010 we also remodeled 17 stores and relocated 2 stores in fiscal 2011 our fiscal 2011 and 2010 new store program represents primarily new stores opened in existing centers compared to prior years when the new store openings were more balanced between new and existing centers this trend is expected to continue for several more years the shift to more existing centers had no impact on new store performance 

 

 continue expanding our offering by adding new products brands and service offerings our strategy is to continue to expand our portfolio of products brands and services both by capitalizing on the success of our existing vendor relationships and by identifying and developing new vendor relationships over the last several years we have added new products from existing vendors across product categories we have also added a number of new brands in recent years most notably in our prestige category which is currently the beauty industry’s highest growth category brand additions include mark jacobs givenchy taylor swift dolce and gabanna and coach in fragrance bliss clarisonic mario badescu jack black the art of shaving dermalogica and philosophy in skin care laura geller butter london benefit cargo and tarte in cosmetics and living proof phyto ouidad and pureology in hair care we also offer haircare services in our full service salons as well as skin and brow services in each of our stores we plan to continue expanding our portfolio of services in the future by establishing ulta as a leading salon authority providing high quality and consistent services from our licensed stylists and introducing new beautyrelated services 

enhancing our successful loyalty program   we have over nine million active customer loyalty members who are enrolled in our loyalty programs loyalty member transactions represent more than fifty percent of our annual total net sales and the transaction data demonstrates that loyalty members shop with higher frequency and spend more per visit as compared to nonmembers we have been converting loyalty members from our national certificate program to the ultamate rewards program which is a pointsbased program currently slightly more than 20 of our stores are on the pointsbased program and we will be rolling additional markets onto this program in fiscal 2012 both loyalty programs provide a robust database of information relative to customer information and shopping behavior which provides a significant longterm opportunity for crm applications including enabling customer segmentation and oneonone marketing communications tailored to our customers’ unique beauty needs 

broaden our marketing reach   we believe a key component of our success is the brand exposure we get from our marketing initiatives which provide an effective means to introduce new products brands and services to our existing and potential new customers we have historically utilized primarily direct mail advertising catalogues and newspaper inserts to communicate with our customers our national magazine print advertising campaign exposes potential new customers to our retail and ecommerce businesses we plan to continue to leverage our 

  

print marketing while expanding our reach into other marketing channels including various broadcast formats digital social media and email marketing we plan to continue to focus on our instore marketing and eventing as an additional means of educating our customers and increasing the frequency of their visits to our stores 

enhancing and expanding our digital business   our website serves two roles to generate direct channel sales and profits and as a vehicle to communicate with our customers in an interactive enjoyable way to reinforce the ulta brand and drive traffic to our stores we continue to aggressively develop and add new website features and functionality marketing programs product assortment and new brands and multichannel integration points we intend to establish ourselves over time as a leading online beauty resource by providing our customers with a rich online experience for information on key trends and products editorial content expanded assortments leading website features and functionality and social media content through our continued enhancements and multichannel marketing initiatives we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth of internet sales of beauty products we believe our website and retail stores provide our customers with an integrated multichannel shopping experience and increased flexibility for their beauty buying needs 

improving our operating margin   we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our infrastructure and continually optimizing the efficiency of our operations we will continue to make investments in our information systems to enable us to enhance our efficiency in areas such as merchandise planning and allocation inventory management distribution and point of sale pos functions we believe we will continue to improve our profitability by reducing our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in particular supply chain general corporate overhead and fixed store expenses 

our market 

we operate within the large and steadily growing us beauty products and salon services industry this market represents approximately 93 billion in retail sales according to euromonitor international and ibis world inc the approximately 53 billion beauty products industry includes color cosmetics haircare fragrance bath and body skincare salon styling tools and other toiletries within this market we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige mass and salon products the approximately 40 billion salon services industry consists of hair face and nail services 

distribution for beauty products is varied prestige products are typically purchased in department or specialty stores while mass products and staple items are generally purchased at drug stores food retail stores and mass merchandisers in addition salon haircare products are sold in salons and authorized professional retail outlets 

competition 

our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores such as macy’s and nordstrom specialty stores such as sephora and bath  body works drug stores such as cvspharmacy and walgreens and mass merchandisers such as target and walmart we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality and assortment of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services 

the market for salon services and products is highly fragmented our competitors for salon services and products include regis corp sally beauty jcpenney salons and independent salons 

key trends 

we believe an important shift is occurring in the distribution of beauty products department stores which have traditionally been the primary distribution channel for prestige beauty products have been meaningfully affected by changing consumer preferences and industry consolidation over the past decade we believe women particularly younger generations tend to find department stores intimidating highpressured and hinder a multibrand shopping experience and as such are choosing to shop elsewhere for their beauty care needs according to industry sources 55 of women aged 18 to 24 shop in specialty stores compared to 40 of women aged 18 to 

  

64 over the past ten years department stores have lost significant market share to specialty stores in apparel and we believe the beauty category is undergoing a similar shift in retail channels we believe women are seeking a shopping experience that provides something different a place to experiment learn about various products find what they want and indulge themselves a recent kline  company report found that consumers seek out specialty retailers for a number of reasons including that specialty stores carry more niche products the merchandise and retail environment is more fun and provides the ability to shop across product lines and the customer service is better than in other channels 

as a result of this market transformation there are a number of beauty brands pursuing new distribution channels for their products such as specialty retail spas and salons direct response television ie home shopping and infomercials and the internet in addition many smaller brands are selling their products through these channels due to the high fixed costs associated with operating in most department stores and to capitalize on consumers’ growing propensity to shop in these channels according to industry sources color cosmetics sales through these channels are projected to grow at a higher rate than sales of color cosmetics in total there are a number of beauty brands that have built significant consumer awareness and sales by initially offering their products on direct response television we benefit from offering brands that sell their products through this channel as we experience increased store traffic and sales after these brands appear on television 

historically manufacturers have distributed their products through distinct channels—department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we believe women are increasingly shopping across retail channels as well as purchasing a combination of prestige and mass beauty products we attribute this trend to a number of factors including the growing availability of prestige brands outside of department stores and increased innovation in mass products based on the competitive environment in which we operate we believe that we have been at the forefront of breaking down the industry’s historical distribution paradigm by combining a wide range of beauty products categories and price points under one roof our strategy reflects a more customercentric model of how women prefer to shop today for their beauty needs 

major growth drivers for the industry include favorable consumer spending trends product innovation and growth of certain population segments 

 

  

  

 we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends and capture additional market share in the industry we believe we have demonstrated an ability to provide a differentiated store experience for customers as well as offer a breadth and depth of merchandise previously unavailable from more traditional beauty retailers

our stores are predominately located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers our typical store is approximately 10000 square feet including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our fullservice salon we opened 61 stores in fiscal 2011 and the average investment required to open a new ulta store is approximately 09 million which includes capital investments net of landlord contributions preopening 

  

expenses and initial inventory net of payables however our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors including geographic location as of january 28 2012 we operated 449 stores in 43 states 

store remodel program 

our retail store concept including physical layout displays lighting and quality of finishes has continued to evolve over time to match the rising expectations of our customers and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies we have a formal store remodel program in place to update our older stores to provide a consistent shopping experience across all of our locations we remodeled 17 stores in fiscal 2011 our newer store prototype including new stores and remodels represents approximately 84 of our store base we continue to evolve this program to update older stores with a consistent look and experience to drive additional customer traffic and increase our sales and profitability the remodel store selection process is subject to the same discipline as our new store real estate decision process our focus is to remodel the oldest highest performing stores first subject to criteria such as rate of return lease terms market performance and quality of real estate we also consider remodeling all relevant stores in a particular geography when appropriate which allows us to present a consistent brand identity across an entire market the average investment to remodel a store in fiscal 2011 was approximately 08 million each remodel takes approximately three months to complete during which time we keep the store open

 item 1a risk factors tableend investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this form 10k before making an investment decision if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or future growth could suffer in these circumstances the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

the global economic crisis and volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets as well as declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the global economic crisis and volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions have led to decreases in consumer spending across the economy increases in the levels of unemployment energy costs healthcare costs and taxes combined with tighter credit markets reduced consumer confidence and other factors contribute to the decline in consumer spending while this decline has moderated the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession and economic conditions could lead to further declines in consumer spending in the future we offer a wide selection of beauty products and premium salon services continued uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact levels of consumer discretionary spending across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services additionally there can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of inventory purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

economic conditions have also resulted in a tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions which is a source of capital for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending while global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from extreme disruptions 

  

experienced over the past few years uncertainty about continuing economic stability remains it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue the extent to which they will continue to recover if at all and which aspects of our products or business may be adversely affected current market and credit conditions could continue to make it more difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary credit to build new retail centers a significant decrease in new retail center development has adversely affected our new store program and could limit our future growth opportunities as long as the aforementioned conditions exist continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies and declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs and could adversely affect our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our product vendors as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry even when economic conditions are favorable we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons internet businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales will decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the regions in which we operate our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities 

  

of other key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

on march 8 2012 we announced the implementation of a chief financial officer succession plan after our current cfo gregg r bodnar advised us that due to a family health issue he will be required to relocate and as such intends to step down from his current position at such time as a suitable successor cfo can be identified in order to facilitate an orderly transition mr bodnar plans to remain in his present position pending the appointment of his successor and is expected to assist in the transition of his successor there can be no assurance however that we will be able to timely identify a suitable successor chief financial officer or that mr bodnar’s services will be available to us through a transition period our inability to facilitate an orderly transition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis during fiscal 2011 we opened 61 new stores we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future and believe we have the longterm potential to grow our store base to over 1000 stores in the united states during fiscal 2011 the average investment required to open a typical new store was approximately 09 million this continued expansion could place increased demands on our financial managerial operational and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we operate two distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in order to support our recent and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business we intend to open a third distribution center in fiscal 2012 our failure to open our third distribution center in fiscal 2012 or to expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 20000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our ecommerce business we have identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations shipment of goods ability to process financial information and credit card transactions and our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders or engage in normal business activities moreover security breaches or leaks of proprietary information including leaks of customers’ private data could result in liability decrease customer confidence in our company and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ecommerce operations while relatively small are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer associate or company information could damage out reputation expose us to litigation and negatively impact our business 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate information as part of our normal course of business we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events any security breach of customer associate or company confidential information could result in damage to our reputation and result in lost sales litigation fines or additional investments to fix or replace the systems that were breached any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our giftwithpurchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors which are beyond our control and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

  

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income this risk is more pronounced during the current severe economic downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers filing for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed consumer spending levels 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendors were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we have no longterm supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

during fiscal 2011 merchandise supplied to ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 53 of our net sales there continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

  

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta” and other marks incorporating that name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions profitability and cash flows 

 

   

  

  

  

 in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including the fda the ftc and state attorneys general in the united states if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties or claims which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our ulta product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising by us may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior buildout of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes which increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance 

  

of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources further we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment in which case our creditors could levy against our assets these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which will reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk 

  

mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring october 2016 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 0225 the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

we may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy and we may be unable to raise capital when needed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

from time to time we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth strategy in addition if general economic financial or political conditions in our markets change or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs if financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses 

reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems processes and controls as well as on our personnel in addition as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as a result we have been required to improve our financial and managerial controls reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of other factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock would likely decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

our current principal stockholder has significant influence over us and they could delay deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree 

our principal stockholder owns or controls in the aggregate approximately 18 of our outstanding common stock as a result this stockholder will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions and will have significant influence over our management and policies such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders in addition the significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with a stockholder holding such significant influence 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future 

although we announced a special cash dividend on march 8 2012 that is payable on may 15 2012 any future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements capital expenditure requirements contractual restrictions anticipated cash needs provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant we may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to pay dividends on our common stock

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through separate distribution channels after extensive research we recognized an opportunity to better satisfy how a woman wanted to shop for beauty products which led to what we believe to be our unique combination of beauty superstore and specialty store attributes we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides onestop shopping for prestige mass and salon products and salon services in the united states we combine the unique elements of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our beauty superstore strategy include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of over 20000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as salon 

  

haircare products we focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories our stores are predominately located in convenient hightraffic locations such as power centers 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our growth strategy including growing our store base expanding our product brand and service offerings enhancing our loyalty program broadening our marketing channels expanding our ecommerce business and improving our profitability by expanding operating margin we believe that the steadily expanding us beauty products and services industry the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy 

comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable store sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others we do not expect our 109 fiscal 2011 comparable store sales increase to continue into the future our longterm annual comparable store sales increase target is 3 to 5 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our supply chain infrastructure and fixed store costs with comparable store sales increases and operating efficiencies we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and decreasing our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales 

global economic conditions 

economic conditions in the us continue to be uncertain fiscal stress in the us and europe has resulted in significant fluctuations in the us stock markets and has negatively impacted consumer sentiment while the us credit markets have stabilized and credit availability has improved compared to the recent recessionary period economic growth is expected to continue to be weak consumer spending habits are affected by levels of unemployment unsettled financial markets weakness in housing and real estate higher interest rates fuel and energy costs and consumer perception of economic conditions among others sudden negative changes in one or more of the factors that affect consumer spending could adversely affect consumer spending levels which could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our sales levels and financial performance 

basis of presentation 

the company has determined its operating segments on the same basis that it uses to internally evaluate performance we have combined our three operating segments retail stores salon services and ecommerce into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumer economic characteristics nature of products and distribution methods 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores and the time of shipment in the case of internet sales merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period ecommerce merchandise sales are excluded from comparable store sales there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 

  

comparable store sales is a critical measure that allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 cost of sales includes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales this presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales 

selling general and administrative expenses include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 this presentation of items in selling general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling general and administrative expenses 

preopening expense includes noncapital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new remodeled and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores store setup labor management and employee training and grand opening advertising 

  

interest expense includes interest costs and unused facility fees associated with our credit facility which is structured as an asset based lending instrument our interest expense will fluctuate based on the seasonal borrowing requirements associated with acquiring inventory in advance of key holiday selling periods and fluctuation in the variable interest rates we are charged on outstanding balances our credit facility is used to fund seasonal inventory needs and new and remodel store capital requirements in excess of our cash on hand and cash flow from operations our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates 

income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores 

results of operations 

our fiscal years are the 52 or 53 week periods ending on the saturday closest to january 31 the company’s fiscal years ended january 28 2012 january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 were 52 week years and are hereafter referred to as fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009

gross profit 

gross profit increased 1327 million or 274 to 6168 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 4841 million in fiscal 2010 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 140 basis points to 347 in fiscal 2011 compared to 333 in fiscal 2010 the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by

interest expense

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 753 million in fiscal 2011 represents an effective tax rate of 385 compared to fiscal 2010 tax expense of 471 million and an effective tax rate of 399 the lower tax rate in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible compensation expense and increases in certain federal and state tax deductions and credits compared to fiscal 2010 

net income 

net income increased 493 million or 693 to 1203 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 710 million in fiscal 2010 the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of 1327 million which was offset by a 526 million increase in sga expenses and a 282 million increase in income tax expense 

fiscal year 2010 versus fiscal year 2009 

net sales 

net sales increased 2320 million or 190 to 14548 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 12228 million in fiscal 2009 salon service sales increased 98 million or 128 to 864 million compared to 766 million in fiscal 2009 the sales increases are due to the opening of 43 net new stores in 2010 and a 110 increase in comparable store sales which was primarily due to a 86 increase in store traffic noncomparable stores which include stores opened in fiscal 2010 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2009 which have not yet turned comparable contributed 1023 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed 1297 million of the total net sales increase we believe the improvement in our comparable store sales trends is due to a combination of factors including effective marketing and merchandise programs and the relatively lower comparable store sales level in the prior year we also believe that overall consumer sentiment and shopping patterns improved in 2010 when compared to 2009 which may have contributed to our improving trends 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 1075 million or 286 to 4841 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 3766 million in fiscal 2009 gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 250 basis points to 333 in fiscal 2010 compared to 308 in fiscal 2009 gross profit in fiscal 2010 was impacted by

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 14 million or 657 to 08 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 22 million in fiscal 2009 fiscal 2010 interest expense represents fees associated with the credit facility we did not utilize the credit facility in fiscal 2010 

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 471 million in fiscal 2010 represents an effective tax rate of 399 compared to fiscal 2009 tax expense of 266 million and an effective tax rate of 403 the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 is primarily attributed to the large number of stock option exercises and share sales deemed to be disqualifying dispositions 

net income 

net income increased 316 million or 805 to 710 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 394 million in fiscal 2009 the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of 1075 million which was offset by a 557 million increase in sga expenses and a 205 million increase in income tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

  

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

merchandise inventories were 2446 million at january 28 2012 compared to 2185 million at january 29 2011 representing an increase of 261 million the increase is due to the addition of 60 net new stores opened since january 29 2011 offset by a 30 decrease in average inventory per store driven by our comparable store sales increases and management initiatives focused on leveraging store and supply chain inventories 

we had a current tax liability of 40 million at the end of fiscal 2011 compared to a prepaid asset of 107 million at the end of fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2010 we finalized the tax benefit estimates related to bonus depreciation on fixed assets and stock option exercises in the fourth quarter which resulted in tax deductions in excess of our year to date estimated tax payments in fiscal 2011 we were able to better forecast the implications of those significant tax drivers as well as the resulting estimated tax payments 

deferred rent liabilities were 1635 million at january 28 2012 an increase of 289 million compared to the prior year end deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is primarily due to the addition of 60 net new stores opened since january 29 2011 

investing activities 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures were 1286 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 971 million and 681 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to the increase in our 2011 new store program during fiscal 2011 we opened 61 new stores remodeled 17 stores and relocated 2 stores compared to 47 new stores 13 remodels and 5 relocation during fiscal 2010 and 37 new stores 6 remodels and 1 relocation during fiscal 2009 

financing activities 

financing activities in fiscal 2011 and 2010 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax effects while financing activities in fiscal 2009 consisted principally of draws and payments on our credit facility and capital stock transactions common stock repurchased in fiscal 2011 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2011 or 2010 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs 

  

dividend 

on march 8 2012 we announced that our board of directors had declared a 100 per share special cash dividend to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 20 2012 the special cash dividend which totals approximately 62 million will be payable on may 15 2012 

our board of directors may determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow capital requirements current and future liquidity restrictions included as part of our credit facility as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time 

credit facility 

on august 31 2010 we terminated our credit facility with bank of america and entered into a new credit facility pursuant to a loan and security agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder jpmorgan chase bank na as a lender and pnc bank national association as a lender 

on october 19 2011 the company entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder wells fargo capital finance llc as a lender jp morgan securities llc as a lender jp morgan chase bank na as a lender and pnc bank national association as a lender the loan agreement amended and restated the loan and security agreement dated as of august 31 2010 by and among the lenders the loan agreement extends the maturity of the company’s credit facility to october 2016 provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 200000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory contains a 10000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 50000 subject to consent by each lender and other conditions the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all times substantially all of the company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 150 and the unused line fee is 0225 

as of january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 the company had no borrowings outstanding under its credit facility 

seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentines’ day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations and letters of credit we do not have any noncancelable purchase commitments as of january 28 2012 

  

contractual obligations 

we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2027 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of january 28 2012 

 

  

 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principals gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified which is the store level significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification tm asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on volatilities of our stock and a peer group of publiclytraded companies the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding we have limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on october 30 2007 as a result we have elected to use the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin on sharebased payments 

see notes to financial statements “summary of significant accounting policies — sharebased compensation” for disclosure related to the company’s stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions see note 10 to our financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions

an offmall location we are conveniently located in hightraffic primarily offmall locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers our typical store is approximately 10000 square feet including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our fullservice salon our displays store design and open layout allow us the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy 

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products after extensive research we recognized an opportunity to better satisfy how a woman wanted to shop for beauty products this led to what we believe to be a unique retail approach that focuses on all aspects of how women prefer to shop for beauty products by combining the fundamental elements of a beauty superstore including onestop shopping a compelling value proposition and convenient locations together with an uplifting specialty retail experience while we are currently executing on the core elements of our business strategy we plan to continually refine our approach in order to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers 

 

our competitive strengths 

 

we believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are critical to our continuing success 

 

differentiated merchandising strategy with broad appeal we believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories price points and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our customers while the products we sell can be found in department stores specialty stores salons drug stores and mass merchandisers we offer all of these products in one retail format so that our customer can find everything she needs in one shopping trip we appeal to a wide range of customers by offering over 500 brands such as bare escentuals cosmetics chanel and estée lauder fragrances l’oréal haircare and cosmetics and paul mitchell haircare we also have private label ulta offerings in key categories because our offerings span a broad array of product categories in prestige mass and salon we appeal to a wide range of customers including women of all ages demographics and lifestyles 

 

our unique customer experience we combine the value and convenience of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer we cater to the woman who loves to indulge in shopping for beauty products as well as the woman who is time constrained and comes to the store knowing exactly what she wants our distribution infrastructure consistently delivers a greater than 95 instock rate so our customers know they will find the products they are looking for our welltrained beauty consultants are not commissionbased or branddedicated and therefore can provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to our customers’ needs together with our customer service strategy our store locations layout and design help create our unique retail shopping experience which we believe increases both the frequency and length of our customers’ visits 

 

retail format poised to benefit from shifting channel dynamics over the past several years the approximately 96 billion beauty products and salon services industry has experienced significant changes including a shift in how manufacturers distribute and customers purchase beauty products this has enabled the specialty retail channel in which we operate to grow at a greater rate than the industry overall since at least 2000 we are capitalizing on these trends by offering a primarily offmall serviceoriented specialty retail concept with a comprehensive product mix across categories and price points 

 

loyal and active customer base we have almost 8 million customer loyalty program members we utilize this valuable proprietary database to drive traffic better understand our customers’ purchasing patterns and support new store site selection we regularly distribute catalogs and newspaper inserts to entertain and educate our customers and most importantly to drive traffic to our stores 

 

strong vendor relationships across product categories we have strong active relationships with over 300 vendors including estée lauder bare escentuals coty l’oréal and procter  gamble we believe the scope and extent of these relationships which span the three distinct beauty categories of prestige mass and salon and have taken years to develop create a significant impediment for other retailers to replicate our model these relationships also frequently afford us the opportunity to work closely with our vendors to market both new and existing brands in a collaborative manner 

 

experienced management team we have an experienced senior management team with extensive retail experience that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our 

business chuck rubin was appointed president chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors effective may 10 2010 and assumed the role of chief executive officer on september 2 2010 mr rubin has over 30 years of experience in the retail industry including senior executive level operating merchandising and marketing management roles as well as partner level consulting roles across retail formats and ecommerce businesses mr rubin along with gregg bodnar our chief financial officer lead our senior management team over the past several years we have significantly expanded the depth of our management team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our growth strategy 

 

growth strategy 

 

we intend to expand our presence as a leading retailer of beauty products and salon services by pursuing the following primary growth strategies 

 

growing our store base to over 1000 stores in the united states we continue to believe that over the longterm we have the potential to grow our store base to over 1000 ulta stores in the united states our internal real estate model takes into account a number of variables including demographic and sociographic data as well as population density relative to maximum drive times economic and competitive factors we plan to continue opening stores both in markets in which we currently operate and new markets as the economy recovers we believe our successful track record of opening new stores in diverse markets across the united states will allow us to increase our new store growth rates back to historical levels consistent with our longterm target of 15 to 20 

 

we opened 47 new stores during fiscal 2010 representing a 13 increase in square footage growth and a 27 increase in the number of new stores opened compared to 37 in fiscal 2009 we also remodeled 13 stores and relocated 5 stores in fiscal 2010 the 2009 new store program was reduced primarily due to the uncertainty in the economy and the decline in highquality commercial real estate projects that we typically target for our new store locations our fiscal 2010 new store program represents primarily new stores opened in existing centers compared to prior years when the new store openings were more balanced between new and existing centers this trend is expected to continue for several more years the shift to more existing centers had no impact on new store performance 

 

 

 

increasing our sales and profitability by expanding our product brand and service offerings our strategy is to continue to expand our portfolio of products brands and services both by capitalizing on the success of our existing vendor relationships and by identifying and developing new supply sources over the last several years we have added new products from existing vendors across product categories we have also added a number of new brands in recent years most notably in our prestige category which is currently the beauty industry’s highest growth category brand additions include juicy couture dolce and gabanna and coach poppy in fragrance dermalogica murad and philosophy in skin care benefit cargo and tarte in cosmetics and pureology in hair care we also offer haircare services in our full service salons as well as skin and brow services in each of our stores we plan to continue expanding our portfolio of services in the future by establishing ulta as a leading salon authority providing high quality and consistent services from our licensed stylists and introducing new beautyrelated services 

 

enhancing our successful loyalty program we have almost 8 million active customer loyalty members who are enrolled in our loyalty programs loyalty member transactions represent more than 50 of our annual 

total net sales and the transaction data demonstrates that loyalty members shop with higher frequency and spend more per visit as compared to nonmembers we have been converting loyalty members from our national certificate program to the ultamate rewards program which is a pointsbased program currently slightly more than 20 of our stores are on the pointsbased program both loyalty programs provide a robust database of information relative to customer information and shopping behavior which provides a significant longterm opportunity for crm applications including enabling customer segmentation and oneonone marketing communications tailored to our customers’ unique beauty needs 

 

broaden our marketing channels we believe a key component of our success is the brand exposure we get from our marketing initiatives which provide an effective means to introduce new products brands and services to our existing and potential new customers we have historically utilized primarily direct mail advertising catalogues and newspaper inserts to communicate with our customers our national magazine print advertising campaign exposes potential new customers to our retail and ecommerce businesses we plan to continue to leverage our print marketing while expanding our reach into other marketing channels including television digital social media and email marketing we also believe we have an opportunity to increase our instore marketing efforts as an additional means of educating our customers and increasing the frequency of their visits to our stores 

 

enhancing and expanding our ecommerce business our website serves two roles to generate direct channel sales and profits and as a vehicle to communicate with our customers in an interactive enjoyable way to reinforce the ulta brand and drive traffic to our stores we continue to aggressively develop and add new website features and functionality marketing programs product assortment and new brands and multichannel integration points we intend to establish ourselves over time as a leading online beauty resource for women by providing our customers with a rich online experience for information on key trends and products editorial content expanded assortments leading website features and functionality and social media content through our continued enhancements and multichannel marketing initiatives we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth of internet sales of beauty products we believe our website and retail stores provide our customers with an integrated multichannel shopping experience and increased flexibility for their beauty buying needs 

 

improving our profitability by leveraging our fixed costs we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our existing infrastructure and continually optimizing our operations we will continue to make investments in our information systems to enable us to enhance our efficiency in areas such as merchandise planning and allocation inventory management distribution and point of sale pos functions we believe we will continue to improve our profitability by reducing our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in particular supply chain general corporate overhead and fixed store expenses 

 

our market 

 

we operate within the large and steadily growing us beauty products and salon services industry this market represents approximately 96 billion in retail sales according to euromonitor international and ibis world inc the approximately 52 billion beauty products industry includes color cosmetics haircare fragrance bath and body skincare salon styling tools and other toiletries within this market we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige mass and salon products the approximately 44 billion salon services industry consists of hair face and nail services 

 

distribution for beauty products is varied prestige products are typically purchased in department or specialty stores while mass products and staple items are generally purchased at drug stores food retail stores and mass merchandisers in addition salon haircare products are sold in salons and authorized professional retail outlets 

 

competition 

 

our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores such as macy’s and nordstrom specialty stores such as sephora and bath  body works drug stores such as cvspharmacy and walgreens and mass merchandisers such as target and walmart we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality and assortment of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our 

customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services 

 

the market for salon services and products is highly fragmented our competitors for salon services and products include regis corp sally beauty jcpenney salons and independent salons 

 

key trends 

 

we believe an important shift is occurring in the distribution of beauty products department stores which have traditionally been the primary distribution channel for prestige beauty products have been meaningfully affected by changing consumer preferences and industry consolidation over the past decade we believe women particularly younger generations tend to find department stores intimidating highpressured and hinder a multibrand shopping experience and as such are choosing to shop elsewhere for their beauty care needs according to industry sources 55 of women aged 18 to 24 shop in specialty stores compared to 40 of women aged 18 to 64 over the past ten years department stores have lost significant market share to specialty stores in apparel and we believe the beauty category is undergoing a similar shift in retail channels we believe women are seeking a shopping experience that provides something different a place to experiment learn about various products find what they want and indulge themselves a recent kline  company report found that consumers seek out specialty retailers for a number of reasons including that specialty stores carry more niche products the merchandise and retail environment is more fun and provides the ability to shop across product lines and the customer service is better than in other channels 

 

as a result of this market transformation there has been an increase in the number of beauty brands pursuing new distribution channels for their products such as specialty retail spas and salons direct response television ie home shopping and infomercials and the internet in addition many smaller brands are selling their products through these channels due to the high fixed costs associated with operating in most department stores and to capitalize on consumers’ growing propensity to shop in these channels according to industry sources color cosmetics sales through these channels are projected to grow at a higher rate than sales of color cosmetics in total there are a growing number of brands that have built significant consumer awareness and sales by initially offering their products on direct response television we benefit from offering brands that sell their products through this channel as we experience increased store traffic and sales after these brands appear on television 

 

historically manufacturers have distributed their products through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we believe women are increasingly shopping across retail channels as well as purchasing a combination of prestige and mass beauty products we attribute this trend to a number of factors including the growing availability of prestige brands outside of department stores and increased innovation in mass products based on the competitive environment in which we operate we believe that we have been at the forefront of breaking down the industry’s historical distribution paradigm by combining a wide range of beauty products categories and price points under one roof our strategy reflects a more customercentric model of how women prefer to shop today for their beauty needs 

 

major growth drivers for the industry include favorable consumer spending trends product innovation and growth of certain population segments 

 

 7 

  

  

we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends and capture additional market share in the industry we believe we have demonstrated an ability to provide a differentiated store experience for customers as well as offer a breadth and depth of merchandise previously unavailable from more traditional beauty retailers

store remodel program 

 

our retail store concept including physical layout displays lighting and quality of finishes has continued to evolve over time to match the rising expectations of our customers and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies in recent years our strategic focus has been on refining our new store model improving our real estate selection process and executing on our new store opening program as a result we decided to limit the investments made in our existing store base from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2006 we developed and initiated a store remodel program to update our oldest stores to provide a consistent shopping experience across all of our locations we remodeled 13 stores in fiscal 2010 our newest store prototype including new stores and remodels after 2005 represents approximately 75 of our store base we continue to evolve this program to update older stores with a consistent look and experience to drive additional customer traffic and increase our sales and profitability the remodel store selection process is subject to the same discipline as our new store real estate decision process our focus is to remodel the oldest highest performing stores first subject to criteria such as rate of return lease terms market performance and quality of real estate the average investment to remodel a store in fiscal 2010 was approximately 09 million each remodel takes approximately three months to complete during which time we typically keep the store open

marketing and advertising 

 

marketing strategy 

 

we employ a multifaceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to both our stores and website our marketing strategy complements a basic tenet of our business strategy which is to provide our customers with a satisfying and uplifting experience we communicate this vision to our customers and prospective customers through a multimedia multitouchpoint approach our primary media expenditure is in direct mail catalogs and freestanding newspaper inserts these vehicles allow the customer to see the breadth of our selection of prestige mass and salon beauty products 

 

in order to reach new customers and to establish ulta as a national brand we advertise in national beauty and lifestyle magazines such as instyle allure lucky elle and vanity fair these advertising channels have historically been successful in raising our brand awareness on a national level and driving additional sales from both existing and new customers in conjunction with our national brand advertising we have initiated a public relations strategy that focuses on reaching top tier magazine editors to ensure consistent messaging in beauty magazines as well as directtocustomer efforts through multimedia channels 

 

our ecommerce marketing strategy complements our print media strategy ultacom serves not only as an ecommerce site but additionally as an extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand and product offerings and providing a 24 hour forum for loyalists to engage with the brand this dual role for ultacom exists through online marketing strategies including search marketing affiliate marketing social networking banner advertising and other online marketing channels ultacom’s email marketing programs are also effective in communicating with and driving sales from online and retail store customers

we believe our trademarks especially those related to the ulta brand have significant value and are important to building brand recognition 

 

government regulation 

 

in our us markets we are affected by extensive laws governmental regulations administrative determinations court decisions and similar constraints such laws regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal state or local levels in the united states the cosmetic and overthecounter otc drug products we sell in our stores including our ulta branded products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration fda the federal trade commission ftc and state attorneys general ag in the united states such regulations principally relate to the safety of ingredients proper labeling advertising packaging and marketing of the products 

 

products classified as cosmetics as defined in the food drug and cosmetic fdc act are not subject to premarket approval by the fda but the products and the ingredients must be safe and must be properly labeled certain products such as sunscreens and acne treatments are classified as otc drugs which have specific ingredient labeling and manufacturing requirements the labeling of cosmetic and otc drug products is subject to the requirements of the fdc act and the fair packaging and labeling act further claims we make in advertising including claims about the safety or efficacy of products pricing claims and environmental claims are subject to regulation by the ftc and state ag’s who generally prohibit deceptive practices 

the government regulations that most impact our daytoday operations are the labor and employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject we are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws both federal and state our salon business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon procedures 

 

in our store leases we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use but at times the responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or buildouts that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or buildouts

 item 1a risk factors 

 

investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this form 10k before making an investment decision if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or future growth could suffer in these circumstances the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

 

the recent global economic crisis and volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets as well as declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

 

the global economic crisis and volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions have led to decreases in consumer spending across the economy increases in the levels of unemployment energy costs healthcare costs and taxes combined with tighter credit markets reduced consumer confidence and other factors contribute to the decline in consumer spending while this decline has recently moderated the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession and economic conditions could lead to further declines in consumer spending in the future additionally there can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits reduced 

consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of inventory purchased by our customers and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits all of which may adversely affect our industry business and financial condition 

 

economic conditions have also resulted in a tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions which is a source of capital for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending while global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from extreme disruptions experienced over the past few years uncertainty about continuing economic stability remains it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue the extent to which they will continue to recover if at all and which aspects of our products or business may be adversely affected current market and credit conditions could continue to make it more difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary credit to build new retail centers a significant decrease in new retail center development has adversely affected our new store program and could limit our future growth opportunities as long as the aforementioned conditions exist continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies and declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

 

continued economic uncertainty may affect consumer purchases of discretionary beauty products and salon services which could delay our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

our financial condition may be materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally both in the us and elsewhere around the world the stress experienced by global capital markets in 2008 and 2009 persisted into 2010 concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and the us mortgage and real estate markets have contributed to volatility and diminished expectations for the economy we offer a wide selection of beauty products and premium salon services continued uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact levels of consumer discretionary spending across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates and tax rates the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions a decrease in spending due to lower consumer discretionary income or consumer confidence could adversely impact our net sales and operating results and could force us to delay or slow our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our product vendors as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry even when economic conditions are favorable we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons internet businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for 

beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales will decrease 

 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the regions in which we operate our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team chuck rubin was appointed president chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors effective may 10 2010 and assumed the role of chief executive officer on september 2 2010 any significant leadership or executive management transition involves inherent risks in addition if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of other key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

 

we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis during fiscal 2010 we opened 47 new stores we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future and believe we have the longterm potential to grow our store base to over 1000 stores in the united states during fiscal 2010 the average investment required to open a typical new store was approximately 09 million this continued expansion could place increased demands on our financial managerial operational and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance and slow our growth 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate two distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in order to support our recent and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business we intend to open a third distribution center in fiscal 2012 our failure to expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

any significant interruption in the operations of our two distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 21000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our ecommerce business we have identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations shipment of goods ability to process financial information and credit card transactions and our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders or engage in normal business activities moreover security breaches or leaks of proprietary information including leaks of customers’ private data could result in liability decrease customer confidence in our company and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our ecommerce operations while relatively small are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

 

we directly source the majority of our giftwithpurchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political 

changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors which are beyond our control and these factors could materially hurt our business financial condition and results of operations or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers or lifestyle centers which also accommodate other wellknown destination retailers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants while lifestyle centers typically contain a variety of highend destination retailers but no large anchor stores as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in the lifestyle centers and power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center or lifestyle center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income this risk is more pronounced during the current severe economic downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers filing for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed consumer spending levels 

 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendors were unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position our business and financial performance 

 

we have no longterm supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

 

during fiscal 2010 merchandise supplied to ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 48 of our net sales the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendors could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta” and other marks incorporating that name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely damage our brand reputation and 

image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

 

  

in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including the fda the ftc and state attorneys general in the united states if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties or claims which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our ulta product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising by us may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior buildout of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes which increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

 

our ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources further we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment in which case our creditors could levy against our assets these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or 

royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could hurt our profitability 

 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which will reduce our profitability 

 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs would reduce our profitability to the extent that we are unable to offset those increases by raising selling prices or by reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions 

 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility or credit facility with a term expiring may 2013 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 200 and the unused line fee is 025 the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things limit our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

we may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy and we may be unable to raise capital when needed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

from time to time we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth strategy in addition if general economic financial or political conditions in our markets change or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs if financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer 

 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses 

 

reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems processes and controls as well as on our personnel in addition as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as a result we have been required to improve our financial and managerial controls reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 

 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

 23 

 

  

in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

 

our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

 

our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of other factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock would likely decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

our current principal stockholder has significant influence over us and they could delay deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree 

 

our principal stockholder owns or controls in the aggregate approximately 18 of our outstanding common stock as a result this stockholder will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions and will have significant influence over our management and policies such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders in addition the significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with a stockholder holding such significant influence 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

  

as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock

overview 

 

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through separate distribution channels after extensive research we recognized an opportunity to better satisfy how a woman wanted to shop for beauty products which led to what we believe to be our unique combination of beauty superstore and specialty store attributes we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance 

 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides onestop shopping for prestige mass and salon products and salon services in the united states we combine the unique elements of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our beauty superstore strategy include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of over 21000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as salon haircare products we focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories our stores are conveniently located in hightraffic primarily offmall locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers 

 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our growth strategy including growing our store base expanding our product brand and service offerings enhancing our loyalty program broadening our marketing channels expanding our ecommerce business and improving our profitability by leveraging our fixed costs we believe that the steadily expanding us beauty products and services industry the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy 

 

comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry our comparable store sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales including general us economic conditions changes in merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities among others we do not expect our 110 fiscal 2010 comparable store sales increase to continue into the future our longterm annual comparable store sales increase target is 3 to 5 

 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our supply chain infrastructure and fixed store costs with comparable store sales increases and operating efficiencies we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and decreasing our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales 

 

global economic conditions 

 

the global economic crisis and resulting volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while economic conditions have begun to show signs of improvement the recovery has proceeded at a sluggish rate and the retail environment has remained weak as a result of market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by decreased liquidity in credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers while global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from the extreme disruptions experienced over the past few years uncertainty about continuing economic stability remains these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies and declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and 

financial condition of our customers including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

 

current business trends 

 

our comparable store sales for first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 were 23 17 15 and 62 respectively comparable store sales for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010 were 108 108 122 and 104 respectively fiscal 2010 two year comparable store sales for the respective quarters were 85 91 137 and 166 respectively we believe the improvement in our comparable store sales trends is due to a combination of factors including effective marketing and merchandising programs as well as improved consumer sentiment and shopping patterns due to a general improvement in us economic conditions compared to fiscal 2009 and 2008 

 

we do not expect the low double digit comparable store increases of fiscal 2010 to continue into the future our longterm annual net income growth target of 25 to 30 is based on comparable store sales increases of 3 to 5 

 

basis of presentation 

 

the company has determined its operating segments on the same basis that it uses to internally evaluate performance we have combined our three operating segments retail stores salon services and ecommerce into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumer economic characteristics nature of products and distribution methods 

 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale pos in our retail stores and the time of shipment in the case of internet sales merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

 

comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period ecommerce merchandise sales are excluded from comparable store sales there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales as a result data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 

 

comparable store sales is a critical measure that allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results

our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales this presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include 

 

  

this presentation of items in selling general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling general and administrative expenses 

 

preopening expense includes noncapital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new remodeled and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores store setup labor management and employee training and grand opening advertising 

 

interest expense includes interest costs and unused facility fees associated with our credit facility which is structured as an asset based lending instrument our interest expense will fluctuate based on the seasonal borrowing requirements associated with acquiring inventory in advance of key holiday selling periods and fluctuation in the variable interest rates we are charged on outstanding balances our credit facility is used to fund seasonal inventory needs and new and remodel store capital requirements in excess of our cash flow from operations our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates 

 

income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores 

 

results of operations 

 

our fiscal years are the 52 or 53 week periods ending on the saturday closest to january 31 the company’s fiscal years ended january 29 2011 january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 were 52 week years and are hereafter referred to as fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008

have not yet turned comparable contributed 1023 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed 1297 million of the total net sales increase we believe the improvement in our comparable store sales trends is due to a combination of factors including effective marketing and merchandise programs and the relatively lower comparable store sales level in the prior year we also believe that overall consumer sentiment and shopping patterns improved in 2010 when compared to 2009 which may have contributed to our improving trends

net income 

 

net income increased 316 million or 805 to 710 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 394 million in fiscal 2009 the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of 1075 million which was offset by a 557 million increase in sga expenses and a 205 million increase in income tax expense

preopening expenses decreased 83 million or 581 to 60 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 143 million in fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2009 we opened 37 new stores and remodeled 6 stores during fiscal 2008 we opened 63 new stores and remodeled 8 stores 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense decreased 17 million or 442 to 22 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 39 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 45 million decrease in the weightedaverage debt outstanding on our variable rate credit facility during fiscal 2009 

 

income tax expense 

 

income tax expense of 266 million in fiscal 2009 represents an effective tax rate of 403 compared to fiscal 2008 tax expense of 171 million which represents an effective tax rate of 403 

 

net income 

 

net income increased 141 million or 558 to 394 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 253 million in fiscal 2008 the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of 451 million and a 83 million decrease in preopening expenses which were offset by a 316 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses and a 95 million increase in income tax expense 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors 

 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

 

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

 

merchandise inventories were 2185 million at january 29 2011 compared to 2069 million at january 30 2010 representing an increase of 116 million the increase is due to the addition of 43 net new stores opened since january 30 2010 offset by a 61 decrease in average inventory per store driven by management initiatives focused on leveraging store and supply chain inventories the reduction in inventories in fiscal 2010 did not affect our store instock levels or the customer experience 

income taxes were prepaid by 107 million at january 29 2011 compared to an accrual of 108 million at january 30 2010 the change in our year end tax position is primarily due to the combination of 2010 changes in federal tax regulations which allowed accelerated or bonus depreciation of fixed assets and a large number of stock option exercises and share sales deemed to be disqualifying dispositions the estimate related to bonus depreciation and the tax benefit related to stock option exercises were finalized during the fourth quarter fiscal 2010 and resulted in federal income tax deductions which were significantly in excess of our year todate estimated tax payments we expect to apply the fiscal 2010 overpayments to our fiscal 2011 federal income tax liabilities 

 

accounts payable were 871 million at january 29 2011 compared to 564 million at january 30 2010 an increase of 307 million the increase is attributed to a combination of a higher level of inventory purchases late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year on significantly higher comparable store sales trends and changes in vendor payment terms 

 

deferred rent liabilities were 1346 million at january 29 2011 an increase of 209 million compared to the prior year end deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is due to fiscal 2010 activity which includes 43 net new stores 

 

investing activities 

 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures were 971 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 681 million and 1109 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to the increase in our 2010 new store program during fiscal 2010 we opened 47 new stores remodeled 13 stores and relocated 5 stores compared to 37 new stores 6 remodels and 1 relocation during fiscal 2009 and 63 new stores and a new distribution center during fiscal 2008 

 

financing activities 

 

financing activities in fiscal 2010 consist of capital stock transactions while financing activities in fiscal 2009 and 2008 consisted principally of draws and payments on our credit facility and capital stock transactions the decrease in cash used in financing activities of 1320 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily the result of not utilizing the credit facility in fiscal 2010 the remaining difference is related to capital stock transactions 

 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2010 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including stronger than expected sales growth overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions and a planned reduction in our fiscal 2009 and 2010 new store program 

 

credit facility 

 

prior to august 31 2010 the company’s credit facility was with bank of america national association as administrative agent wachovia capital finance corporation as collateral agent and jp morgan chase bank as documentation agent we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility as of august 31 2010 

 

on august 31 2010 we terminated our credit facility with bank of america and entered into a new credit facility pursuant to a loan and security agreement with wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent collateral agent and a lender thereunder jpmorgan chase bank na as a lender and pnc bank national association as a lender this new facility provides maximum credit of 200 million through may 31 2013 and is available for working capital and general corporate purposes the facility provides maximum borrowings equal to the lesser of 200 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory and contains a 10 million subfacility for letters of credit the new credit facility agreement contains a restrictive financial covenant requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of not less than 200 million our tangible net worth was 4025 million at january 29 2011 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the new facility outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 200 and the unused line fee is 025 

we did not utilize the new credit facility during fiscal 2010 and had no borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility as of january 29 2011 

 

seasonality 

 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentines’ day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations and letters of credit we do not have any noncancelable purchase commitments as of january 29 2011 our letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility expired in september 2009 the balance was 03 million as of january 31 2009 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2024 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of january 29 2011 

 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principals gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and 

evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

inventory valuation 

 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified which is the store level significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification tm asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on volatilities of our stock and a peer group of publiclytraded companies the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding we have limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on october 30 2007 as a result we have elected to use the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin on sharebased payments 

 

see notes to financial statements “summary of significant accounting policies — sharebased compensation” for disclosure related to the company’s stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions see note 10 to our financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products when lyn kirby our current president and chief executive officer joined us in december 1999 we embarked on a multiyear strategy to understand and embrace what women want in a beauty retailer and transform ulta into the shopping experience that it is today we conducted extensive research and surveys to analyze customer response and our effectiveness in areas such as instore experience merchandise selection salon services and marketing strategies based on our research and customer surveys we pioneered what we believe to be a unique retail approach that focuses on all aspects of how women prefer to shop for beauty products by combining the fundamental elements of a beauty superstore including onestop shopping a compelling value proposition and convenient locations together with an uplifting specialty retail experience through our 

  emphasis on “the five e’s” while we are currently executing on the core elements of our business strategy we plan to continually refine our approach in order to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers 

 

our competitive strengths 

 

we believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are critical to our continuing success 

 

differentiated merchandising strategy with broad appeal we believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories price points and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our customers while the products we sell can be found in department stores specialty stores salons drug stores and mass merchandisers we offer all of these products in one retail format so that our customer can find everything she needs in one shopping trip we appeal to a wide range of customers by offering over 500 brands such as bare escentuals cosmetics chanel and estée lauder fragrances l’oréal haircare and cosmetics and paul mitchell haircare we also have private label ulta offerings in key categories because our offerings span a broad array of product categories in prestige mass and salon we appeal to a wide range of customers including women of all ages demographics and lifestyles 

 

our unique customer experience we combine the value and convenience of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer the “five e’s” provide the foundation for our operating strategy we cater to the woman who loves to indulge in shopping for beauty products as well as the woman who is time constrained and comes to the store knowing exactly what she wants our distribution infrastructure consistently delivers a greater than 95 instock rate so our customers know they will find the products they are looking for our welltrained beauty consultants are not commissionbased or branddedicated and therefore can provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to our customers’ needs together with our customer service strategy our store locations layout and design help create our unique retail shopping experience which we believe increases both the frequency and length of our customers’ visits 

 

retail format poised to benefit from shifting channel dynamics over the past several years the approximately 80 billion beauty products and salon services industry has experienced significant changes including a shift in how manufacturers distribute and customers purchase beauty products this has enabled the specialty retail channel in which we operate to grow at a greater rate than the industry overall since at least 2000 we are capitalizing on these trends by offering a primarily offmall serviceoriented specialty retail concept with a comprehensive product mix across categories and price points 

 

loyal and active customer base we have approximately seven million customer loyalty program members the majority of whom have shopped at one of our stores within the past 12 months we utilize this valuable proprietary database to drive traffic better understand our customers’ purchasing patterns and support new store site selection we regularly distribute catalogs and newspaper inserts to entertain and educate our customers and most importantly to drive traffic to our stores 

 

strong vendor relationships across product categories we have strong active relationships with over 300 vendors including estée lauder bare escentuals coty l’oréal and procter  gamble we believe the scope and extent of these relationships which span the three distinct beauty categories of prestige mass and salon and have taken years to develop create a significant impediment for other retailers to replicate our model these relationships also frequently afford us the opportunity to work closely with our vendors to market both new and existing brands in a collaborative manner 

 

experienced management team we have an experienced senior management team with extensive beauty and retail experience that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business our senior management team is led by lyn kirby our president and chief executive officer and gregg bodnar our chief financial officer additionally over the past several years we have significantly expanded the depth of our management team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our growth strategy 

  growth strategy 

 

we intend to expand our presence as a leading retailer of beauty products and salon services by 

 

growing our store base we opened 37 stores representing square footage growth of 12 and remodeled 6 stores in fiscal 2009 due to the economic downturn the number of highquality commercial real estate projects of the size and with the cotenant mix that we typically target for our new store locations has significantly declined as a result we reduced our new store program for 2009 

 

as the economy stabilizes and begins to recover we believe our successful track record of opening new stores in diverse markets across the united states will allow us to increase our new store growth rates back to historical levels consistent with our longterm target of 15 to 20 we continue to believe that over the longterm we have the potential to grow our store base to over 1000 ulta stores in the united states our internal real estate model takes into account a number of variables including demographic and sociographic data as well as population density relative to maximum drive times economic and competitive factors we plan to continue opening stores both in markets in which we currently operate and new markets 

 

 

 

increasing our sales and profitability by expanding our prestige brand offerings our strategy is to continue to expand our portfolio of products and brands in particular to enhance our offering of prestige brands both by capitalizing on the success of our existing vendor relationships and by identifying and developing new supply sources we plan to continue to expand and attract additional prestige brands to our stores by increasing education for our beauty consultants providing high levels of customer service and tailoring the presentation and merchandising of these products in our stores to appeal to prestige vendors for example as of january 30 2010 we have installed “boutique” areas of approximately 200 square feet in 215 of our stores to showcase and build brand equity for key vendors and to provide our customers with a place to experiment and learn about these products we intend to install this feature in most of our stores over time over the last several years we have added several prestige brands including juicy couture ed hardy and marc jacobs lola fragrances pureology and liquid keratin hair care dermalogica korres and mario badescu skin care benefit cargo and lorac cosmetics and philosophy fragrance and bath we continue to seek opportunities to test prestige brands in our stores in order to expand our prestige brand offerings we believe this strategy will positively influence our number of customer transactions and their average transaction value 

 

improving our profitability by leveraging our fixed costs we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our existing infrastructure and continually optimizing our operations we will continue to make investments in our information systems to enable us to enhance our efficiency in areas such as merchandise planning and allocation inventory management distribution and point of sale pos functions we believe we will continue to improve our profitability by reducing our operating expenses in particular general corporate overhead and fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

 

continuing to enhance our brand awareness to generate sales growth we believe a key component of our success is the brand exposure we get from our marketing initiatives our direct mail advertising programs are designed to drive additional traffic to our stores by highlighting current promotional events and new product offerings our national magazine print advertising campaign exposes potential new customers to our retail concept by conveying an attractive and sophisticated brand message we believe we have an opportunity to 

  increase our instore marketing efforts as an additional means of educating our customers and increasing the frequency of their visits to our stores 

 

driving increased customer traffic to our salons we are committed to establishing ulta as a leading salon authority we seek to increase salon traffic and grow salon revenues by providing high quality and consistent services from our licensed stylists who are knowledgeable about the newest hair fashion trends our objective is to create customer loyalty increase conversion of our retail customers to our salon services encourage referrals and distinguish our salons from those of our competitors our stylists are trained to sell haircare products to their customers by demonstrating the products while styling their customers’ hair additionally we have refined our recruiting methods hiring procedures and training programs to enhance stylist retention which is an important factor in salon productivity 

 

expanding our ecommerce business in addition to relaunching our ultacom website and ecommerce platform in november 2007 we continue to aggressively develop and add new website features and functionality marketing programs product assortment and new brands and multichannel integration points to drive increased visitor traffic and revenue to this channel we intend to establish ourselves over time as a leading online beauty resource for women by providing our customers with a rich online experience for information on key trends and products editorial content expanded assortments leading website features and functionality and social media content through our continued enhancements and multichannel marketing initiatives we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth of internet sales of beauty products we believe our website and retail stores provide our customers with an integrated multichannel shopping experience and increased flexibility for their beauty buying needs 

 

our market 

 

we operate within the large and steadily growing us beauty products and salon services industry this market represents approximately 80 billion in retail sales according to a 2008 report by kline  company and ibisworld inc the approximately 36 billion beauty products industry includes color cosmetics haircare fragrance bath and body skincare salon styling tools and other toiletries within this market we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige mass and salon products the approximately 44 billion salon services industry consists of hair face and nail services 

 

distribution for beauty products is varied prestige products are typically purchased in department or specialty stores while mass products and staple items are generally purchased at drug stores food retail stores and mass merchandisers in addition salon haircare products are sold in salons and authorized professional retail outlets 

 

competition 

 

our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores such as macy’s and nordstrom specialty stores such as sephora and bath  body works drug stores such as cvspharmacy and walgreens and mass merchandisers such as target and walmart we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality and assortment of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services 

 

the market for salon services and products is highly fragmented our competitors for salon services and products include regis corp sally beauty jcpenney salons premier salons and independent salons 

 

key trends 

 

we believe an important shift is occurring in the distribution of beauty products department stores which have traditionally been the primary distribution channel for prestige beauty products have been meaningfully affected by changing consumer preferences and industry consolidation over the past decade we believe women particularly younger generations tend to find department stores intimidating highpressured and hinder a multibrand shopping experience and as such are choosing to shop elsewhere for their beauty care needs according to npd 55 of women aged 18 to 24 shop in specialty stores compared to 40 of women 

  aged 18 to 64 over the past ten years department stores have lost significant market share to specialty stores in apparel and we believe the beauty category is undergoing a similar shift in retail channels we believe women are seeking a shopping experience that provides something different a place to experiment learn about various products find what they want and indulge themselves a recent kline  company report found that consumers seek out specialty retailers for a number of reasons including that specialty stores carry more niche products the merchandise and retail environment is more fun and provides the ability to shop across product lines and the customer service is better than in other channels 

 

as a result of this market transformation there has been an increase in the number of prestige beauty brands pursuing new distribution channels for their products such as specialty retail spas and salons direct response television ie home shopping and infomercials and the internet in addition many smaller prestige brands are selling their products through these channels due to the high fixed costs associated with operating in most department stores and to capitalize on consumers’ growing propensity to shop in these channels according to industry sources color cosmetics sales through these channels are projected to grow at a higher rate than sales of color cosmetics in total we believe that based on our recent success in attracting new prestige brands we are wellpositioned to continue to capture additional prestige brands as they expand into specialty stores also there are a growing number of brands that have built significant consumer awareness and sales by initially offering their products on direct response television we benefit from offering brands that sell their products through this channel as we experience increased store traffic and sales after these brands appear on television 

 

historically manufacturers have distributed their products through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we believe women are increasingly shopping across retail channels as well as purchasing a combination of prestige and mass beauty products we attribute this trend to a number of factors including the growing availability of prestige brands outside of department stores and increased innovation in mass products based on the competitive environment in which we operate we believe that we have been at the forefront of breaking down the industry’s historical distribution paradigm by combining a wide range of beauty products categories and price points under one roof our strategy reflects a more customercentric model of how women prefer to shop today for their beauty needs 

 

major growth drivers for the industry include favorable consumer spending trends product innovation and growth of certain population segments 

 

  

we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends and capture additional market share in the industry we believe we have demonstrated an ability to provide a differentiated store experience for customers as well as offer a breadth and depth of merchandise previously unavailable from more traditional beauty retailers 

  stores

store remodel program 

 

our retail store concept including physical layout displays lighting and quality of finishes has continued to evolve over time to match the rising expectations of our customers and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies in recent years our strategic focus has been on refining our new store model improving our real estate selection process and executing on our new store opening program as a result we decided to limit the investments made in our existing store base from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2006 we developed and initiated a store remodel program to update our older stores to provide a consistent shopping experience across all of our locations we remodeled 6 stores in fiscal 2009 we believe this program will improve the appeal of our stores drive additional customer traffic and increase our sales and profitability the remodel store selection process is subject to the same discipline as our new store real estate decision process our focus is to remodel the oldest highest performing stores first subject to criteria such as rate of return lease terms market performance and quality of real estate the average investment to remodel a store in fiscal 2009 was approximately 09 million each remodel takes approximately 13 weeks to complete during which time we typically keep the store open

we focus on offering one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools a typical ulta store carries over 19000 basic and over 2000 promotional products we present these products in an assisted selfservice environment using centrally produced planograms detailed schematics showing product placement in the store and promotional 

  merchandising planners our merchandising team continually monitors current fashion trends historical sales trends and new product launches to keep ulta’s product assortment fresh and relevant to our customers we believe our broad selection of merchandise from moderatepriced brands to higherend prestige brands offers a unique shopping experience for our customers the products we sell can also be found in department stores specialty stores salons mass merchandisers and drug stores but we offer all of these products in one retail format so that our customer can find everything she needs in one stop we believe we offer a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories for example we run frequent promotions and gift coupons for our mass brands giftwithpurchase offers and multiproduct gift sets for our prestige brands and a comprehensive customer loyalty program 

 

we believe our private label products are a strategically important category for growth and profit contribution our objective is to provide quality trendright private label products at a good value to continue to strengthen our customers’ perception of ulta as a contemporary beauty destination ulta manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production in order to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas to build brand image current ulta cosmetics and bath brands have a strong following and we have plans to expand our private label products into additional categories

marketing and advertising 

 

marketing strategy 

 

we employ a multifaceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to our stores our marketing strategy complements a basic tenet of our business strategy which is to provide our customers with a satisfying and uplifting experience we communicate this vision through a multimedia approach our primary media expenditure is in direct mail catalogs and freestanding newspaper inserts these vehicles allow the customer to see the breadth of our selection of prestige mass and salon beauty products 

 

in order to reach new customers and to establish ulta as a national brand we advertise in national magazines such as instyle allure lucky elle and vanity fair these advertising channels have proven successful in raising our brand awareness on a national level and driving additional sales from both existing and new customers in conjunction with our national brand advertising we have initiated a public relations strategy that focuses on reaching top tier magazine editors to ensure consistent messaging in beauty magazines as well as directtocustomer efforts through multimedia channels 

 

our ecommerce marketing strategy complements our print media strategy ultacom serves as an extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand and product offerings this role for ultacom is being implemented through online marketing strategies including search marketing affiliate marketing social networking banner advertising and other online marketing channels ultacom’s email marketing programs are also effective in communicating with and driving sales from online and retail store customers in october 2009 we launched a facebook application for the company’s “windows of love” campaign in support of our breast cancer research foundation program in december 2009 we launched an interactive microsite to support the company’s “12 days of holiday” marketing campaign

we operate two distribution facilities the first facility located in romeoville illinois is approximately 317000 square feet in size including an overflow facility during fiscal 2008 we began operating a second distribution facility in phoenix arizona that is approximately 330000 square feet in size 

 

inventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution facilities we carry over 21000 products and replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches ie lessthancase quantities which allows us to 

  ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required our distribution facilities use warehouse management and warehouse control software systems which have been upgraded or installed in the last few years products are barcoded and scanned using handheld radiofrequency devices as they move within the warehouse to ensure accuracy product is delivered to stores using contract carriers one vendor currently provides storeready orders that can be quickly forwarded to our stores we use carton barcode labels to facilitate these shipments 

 

information technology 

 

we are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position we depend on a variety of information systems and technologies to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing store base we rely on computer systems to provide information for all areas of our business including supply chain merchandising pos ecommerce finance accounting and human resources our core business systems consist mostly of a purchased software program that integrates with our internally developed software solutions our technology also includes a companywide network that connects all corporate users stores and our distribution infrastructure and provides communications for credit card and daily polling of sales and merchandise movement at the store level we intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems people and processes we update the technology supporting our stores distribution infrastructure and corporate headquarters on a continual basis we will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate our growth and enable us to enhance our competitive position

we have registered a number of trademarks in the united states including ulta salon cosmetics fragrance and design ultacom and ulta beauty and two related designs the renewal dates for the identified marks are january 22 2012 ulta salon cosmetics fragrance and design october 8 2012 ultacom july 10 2017 ulta beauty and october 16 2017 the two ulta beauty related designs all marks that are deemed material to our business have been registered in the united states and select foreign countries we have applications pending for certain of these marks in canada 

 

we believe our trademarks especially those related to the ulta brand have significant value and are important to building brand recognition 

 

government regulation 

 

in our us markets we are affected by extensive laws governmental regulations administrative determinations court decisions and similar constraints such laws regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal state or local levels in the united states our ulta branded products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration fda the federal trade commission ftc and state attorneys general in the united states such regulations principally relate to the safety of our ingredients proper labeling advertising packaging and marketing of our products 

 

products classified as cosmetics as defined in the food drug and cosmetic fdc act are not subject to premarket approval by the fda but the products and the ingredients must be tested to ensure safety the fda also utilizes an “intended use” doctrine to determine whether a product is a drug or cosmetic by the labeling claims made for the product certain ingredients commonly used in cosmetics products such as sunscreens and acne treatment ingredients are classified as overthecounter drugs which have specific label requirements and allowable claims the labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the requirements of the fdc act the fair packaging and labeling act and other fda regulations 

 

the government regulations that most impact our daytoday operations are the labor and employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject we are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws both federal and state our salon business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon procedures 

  in our store leases we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use but at times the responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or buildouts that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or buildouts

 item 1a risk factors 

 

investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this form 10k before making an investment decision if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or future growth could suffer in these circumstances the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect our company 

 

the recent global economic crisis and continued volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets as well as prolonged declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

 

the global economic crisis and the continued volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions have led to decreases in consumer spending across the economy increases in the levels of unemployment energy costs healthcare costs and taxes combined with tighter credit markets reduced consumer confidence and other factors contribute to the decline in consumer spending although there has been limited recent improvement in some of these measures the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession such reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of inventory purchased by our customers which may adversely affect our industry business and financial condition 

  economic conditions have also resulted in a substantial tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions which is a source of capital for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue the extent to which they will continue to deteriorate if at all and which aspects of our products or business may be adversely affected current market and credit conditions could make it more difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary credit to build new retail centers a significant decrease in new retail center development has adversely affected our new store program and could limit our future growth opportunities as long as the aforementioned conditions exist continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

 

a further downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary beauty products and salon services which could delay our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

our financial condition may be materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally both in the us and elsewhere around the world the stress experienced by global capital markets that began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during 2008 and 2009 concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy we offer a wide selection of beauty products and premium salon services continued uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact levels of consumer discretionary spending across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates and tax rates the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions a decrease in spending due to lower consumer discretionary income or consumer confidence could adversely impact our net sales and operating results and could force us to delay or slow our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our product vendors as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry even when economic conditions are favorable we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons internet businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 

  as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales will decrease 

 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the regions in which we operate our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team ms kirby our president and chief executive officer since december 1999 is important to our business including her relationships with our vendors and influence on our sales and marketing ms kirby has an agreement to remain employed with us through march 2011 and if we lost ms kirby’s services before the conclusion of this agreement it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of other key executive personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates we will need to attract motivate and retain additional qualified executive managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

 

we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis during fiscal 2009 we opened 37 new stores we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future and believe we have the longterm potential to grow our store base to over 1000 stores in the united states during fiscal 2009 the average investment required to open a typical new store is approximately 11 million this continued expansion could place increased demands on our financial managerial operational and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance and slow our growth 

  the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate two distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in order to support our recent and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business additional distribution centers may need to be added in the future our failure to expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

any significant interruption in the operations of our two distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 21000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping and transportation problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations particularly during the holiday season 

 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our ecommerce business we have identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations shipment of goods ability to process financial information and credit card transactions and our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders or engage in normal business activities moreover security breaches or leaks of proprietary information including leaks of customers’ private data could result in liability decrease customer confidence in our company and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our ecommerce operations while relatively small are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

 

we directly source the majority of our giftwithpurchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political 

  changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors which are beyond our control and these factors could materially hurt our business financial condition and results of operations or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers or lifestyle centers which also accommodate other wellknown destination retailers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants while lifestyle centers typically contain a variety of highend destination retailers but no large anchor stores as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in the lifestyle centers and power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center or lifestyle center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income this risk is more pronounced during the current severe economic downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers filing for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed consumer spending levels 

 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

  we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendors were unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position our business and financial performance 

 

we have no longterm supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

 

during fiscal 2009 merchandise supplied to ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 46 of our net sales the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendors could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta” and other marks incorporating that name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under the fdc act may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however the fda may in the future determine to regulate our cosmetics or the ingredients included in our cosmetics as drugs these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely 

  damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

 

  

in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including the fda the ftc and state attorneys general in the united states if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties or claims which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our ulta product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising by us may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

 

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior buildout of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which 

  we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes which increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

 

our ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources further we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment in which case our creditors could levy against our assets these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors 

  may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could hurt our profitability 

 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which will reduce our profitability 

 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs would reduce our profitability to the extent that we are unable to offset those increases by raising selling prices or by reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions 

 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility or credit facility with a term expiring may 2011 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the eurodollar rate plus 100 up to 100 million and 125 thereafter the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things restrict our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment in addition when our current facility matures in may 2011 we may be unable to obtain similar terms on a new credit facility due to the uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets 

 

we will need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy and we may be unable to raise capital when needed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

from time to time we will seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth strategy in addition if general economic financial or political conditions in our markets change or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs if financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer 

  failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses 

 

reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems processes and controls as well as on our personnel in addition as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as a result we have been required to improve our financial and managerial controls reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 

 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

  

in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

  our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

 

our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of other factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock would likely decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

our current principal stockholders have significant influence over us and they could delay deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree 

 

our principal stockholders own or control in the aggregate approximately 35 of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions and will have significant influence over our management and policies such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders in addition the significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with stockholders holding such significant influence 

 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

 24 

   

  

as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock

overview 

 

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through separate distribution channels in 1999 we embarked on a multiyear strategy to understand and embrace what women want in a beauty retailer and transform ulta into the shopping experience that it is 

  today we pioneered what we believe to be our unique combination of beauty superstore and specialty store attributes we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance 

 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides onestop shopping for prestige mass and salon products and salon services in the united states we combine the unique elements of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our beauty superstore strategy include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of over 21000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as salon haircare products we focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories our stores are conveniently located in hightraffic primarily offmall locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers as of january 30 2010 we operated 346 stores across 38 states in addition to these fundamental elements of a beauty superstore we strive to offer an uplifting shopping experience through what we refer to as “the five e’s” escape education entertainment esthetics and empowerment 

 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our growth strategy including growing our store base expanding our prestige brand offerings driving incremental salon traffic expanding our online business and continuing to enhance our brand awareness we believe that the steadily expanding us beauty products and services industry the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy 

 

comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry we do not expect our comparable store sales increases over the next five years to reflect the sustained high single digit to low double digit increases we experienced in 2005 through early 2007 we believe the sequential decline in our quarterly comparable store sales during 2008 and the comparable store sales declines in first and second quarter 2009 were due primarily to the difficult economic environment while we have experienced some level of stabilization in our comparable store sales during the course of 2009 and recorded a positive comparable store sales increase in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 the continuing economic uncertainty may impact the level of comparable store sales we can achieve 

 

the company adopted a structured stock option compensation program in july 2007 the award of stock options under this program will result in increased stockbased compensation expense in future periods as compared to the expense reflected in our historical financial statements 

 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to increase as a result of our ability to leverage our supply chain infrastructure and fixed store costs with comparable store sales increases we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and decreasing our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales 

 

on october 30 2007 we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 7666667 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 1235 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses selling stockholders sold 2153928 additional shares of common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders we used the net proceeds from the offering to pay 930 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock which satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends 48 million to redeem our series iii preferred stock and 257 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes also in connection with the offering we converted preferred shares into 41524002 common shares and restated the par value of our common stock to 001 per share

the global economic crisis and the continued volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on global economic conditions resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

 

current business trends 

 

during fiscal 2008 we experienced a deceleration of our comparable store sales increases our comparable store increases for the first second and third quarters of fiscal 2008 were 39 37 and 20 respectively the deceleration was especially apparent during the fourth quarter when we reported a comparable store sales decrease of 55 we believe that the deterioration of the us economy was the primary contributing factor to our comparable store sales deceleration throughout fiscal 2008 

 

during fiscal 2009 we experienced a sequential improvement in our comparable store sales comparables store sales for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 were 23 17 15 and 62 respectively we believe the improvement in our comparable store sales trends is due to a combination of factors including our ability to better plan our marketing and merchandise programs for the challenging economic environment and the relatively lower comparable in the prior year fourth quarter period we also believe that overall consumer sentiment and shopping patterns improved somewhat in the second half of 2009 which may have contributed to our improving trends when compared to 2008 

 

basis of presentation 

 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue salon service revenue represents less than 10 of our combined product sales and services revenues and therefore these revenues are combined with product sales we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale pos in our retail stores and the time of shipment in the case of internet sales merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

 

comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period ecommerce merchandise sales are excluded from comparable store sales there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales as a result data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 

  comparable store sales is a critical measure that allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results 

 

  

cost of sales includes 

 

  

our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales this presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include 

 

  

this presentation of items in selling general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling general and administrative expenses 

 

preopening expense includes noncapital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new and remodeled stores including rent during the construction period for new stores store setup labor management and employee training and grand opening advertising 

 

interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facility which is structured as an asset based lending instrument our interest expense will fluctuate based on the seasonal borrowing requirements 

  associated with acquiring inventory in advance of key holiday selling periods and fluctuation in the variable interest rates we are charged on outstanding balances our credit facility is used to fund seasonal inventory needs and new and remodel store capital requirements in excess of our cash flow from operations our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates 

 

income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores 

 

results of operations 

 

our fiscal years are the 52 or 53 week periods ending on the saturday closest to january 31 the company’s fiscal years ended january 30 2010 january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 were 52 week years and are hereafter referred to as fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007

interest expense 

 

interest expense decreased 17 million or 442 to 22 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 39 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 45 million decrease in the weightedaverage debt outstanding on our variable rate credit facility during fiscal 2009 

  income tax expense

net income 

 

net income increased 141 million or 558 to 394 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 253 million in fiscal 2008 the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of 451 million and a 83 million decrease in preopening expenses which were offset by a 316 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses and a 95 million increase in income tax expense 

 

fiscal year 2008 versus fiscal year 2007 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased 1725 million or 189 to 10846 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 9121 million in fiscal 2007 this increase was due to the opening of 62 net new stores in 2008 and a 02 increase in comparable store sales noncomparable stores which include stores opened in fiscal 2008 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2007 which have not yet turned comparable contributed 1707 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed 18 million of the total net sales increase fiscal 2008 comparable store sales were significantly affected by the 55 decrease in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter we believe the continued deterioration and uncertainty in the united states economy were significant contributing factors to our decreased comparable store sales during fiscal 2008 especially during the holiday season when consumers significantly reduced discretionary spending

interest expense 

 

interest expense decreased 06 million or 132 to 39 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 45 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 200 basis point decrease in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variable rate credit facility during fiscal 2008 partially offset by increased borrowings 

 

income tax expense 

 

income tax expense of 171 million in fiscal 2008 represents an effective tax rate of 403 compared to fiscal 2007 tax expense of 168 million which represents an effective tax rate of 399 the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in nondeductible stock compensation expense 

 

net income 

 

net income in fiscal 2008 was flat in comparison to fiscal 2007 net income was impacted by an increase in gross profit of 443 million which was offset by increases in selling general and administrative expenses and preopening expenses 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations including changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors 

 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

 

on october 30 2007 we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 7666667 shares of common stock to the public at a price of 1800 per share resulting in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock of 1380 million selling stockholders sold 2153928 additional shares of common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders the aggregate net proceeds to us were 1235 million after deducting 97 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and 47 million in offering expenses we used the net proceeds from the offering to pay 930 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock which satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends 48 million to redeem our series iii preferred stock and 257 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes also in connection with the offering we converted preferred shares into 41524002 common shares and restated the par value of our common stock to 001 per share 

  the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

 

merchandise inventories were 2069 million at january 30 2010 compared to 2136 million at january 31 2009 representing a decrease of 67 million the decrease is due to a 129 decrease in average inventory per store driven by management initiatives focused on leveraging supply chain inventories offset by the addition of 35 net new stores opened since january 31 2009 the reduction in inventories in fiscal 2009 did not affect our store instock levels or the customer experience 

 

accrued income taxes were 108 million at january 30 2010 compared to a prepaid income taxes position of 86 million at january 31 2009 we received an 80 million income tax refund in may 2009 related to certain tax planning changes adopted in fiscal 2008 

 

deferred rent liabilities were 1137 million at january 30 2010 an increase of 124 million compared to the prior year end deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is due to fiscal 2009 activity which includes 35 net new stores 

 

investing activities 

 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures were 681 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 1109 million and 1019 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively capital expenditures were lower during fiscal 2009 due to the reduction in our 2009 new store program during fiscal 2009 we opened 37 new stores compared to 63 new stores and a new distribution center during fiscal 2008 and 53 new stores during fiscal 2007 

 

during fiscal 2006 our chief executive officer exercised stock options in exchange for a promissory note for 41 million the company withheld 24 million of payrollrelated taxes in connection with the exercised options and that portion of the note has been classified as an investing activity in fiscal 2006 the remainder of the promissory note of 17 million related to exercise proceeds of the options and was classified as a noncash financing activity the note was paid in full on june 29 2007 

 

financing activities 

 

financing activities consist principally of draws and payments on our credit facility and capital stock transactions the increase in cash used in financing activities of 1398 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is primarily the result of 563 million less in proceeds from longterm borrowings and 810 million more in payments on longterm borrowings the remaining difference is related to capital stock transactions 

 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2009 the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including stronger than expected sales growth overall 

  performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions and a planned reduction in our fiscal 2009 new store program while we expect the level of borrowings under the facility will be lower than historical amounts we expect that we will require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs 

 

credit facility 

 

our credit facility is with bank of america national association as the administrative agent wachovia capital finance corporation as collateral agent and jp morgan chase bank as documentation agent this facility provides maximum credit of 200 million through may 31 2011 the facility provides maximum borrowings equal to the lesser of 200 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory the advance rates on owned inventory are 80 85 from september 1 to january 31 the credit facility agreement contains a restrictive financial covenant requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of not less than 80 million on january 30 2010 our tangible net worth was approximately 293 million substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the eurodollar rate plus 100 up to 100 million and 125 thereafter 

 

we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility as of january 30 2010 we had 1060 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility as of january 31 2009 with a weightedaverage interest rate of 152 we had approximately 1969 million and 868 million of availability as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 respectively we also had a letter of credit that expired in september 2009 the balance was 03 million as of january 31 2009 

 

seasonality 

 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentines’ day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations and letters of credit we do not have any noncancelable purchase commitments as of january 30 2010 our letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility expired in september 2009 the balance was 03 million as of january 31 2009 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2024 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized 

  on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of january 30 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principals gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

inventory valuation 

 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

selfinsurance 

 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health workers’ compensation and general liability insurance we maintain stop loss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our liability exposure current stop loss coverage is 150000 for health claims 100000 for general liability claims and 250000 for workers’ compensation claims management estimates undiscounted loss reserves associated with these liabilities in part by considering historical claims experience industry factors and other actuarial assumptions including information provided by third parties selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 were 16 million 19 million and 24 million respectively adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of these reserves were insignificant for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

  impairment of longlived tangible assets 

 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified which is the store level significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with the accounting standards codification tm asc rules for stock compensation sharebased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 

 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on volatilities of our stock and a peer group of publiclytraded companies the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding we have limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on october 30 2007 as a result we have elected to use the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin on sharebased payments 

 

see notes to financial statements “summary of significant accounting policies — sharebased compensation” for disclosure related to the company’s stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions see note 10 to our financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the asc as the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap the asc also recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws as authoritative gaap for sec registrants the asc is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after september 15 2009 we adopted the asc in the third quarter of 2009 and it did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

 

interest rate sensitivity 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowing under our credit facility interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates on january 31 2007 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 25000 that qualified as a cash flow hedge to obtain a fixed interest rate on variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations the swap resulted in fixed rate payments at an interest rate of 511 for a term of three years ending on january 31 2010 

 

as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 the interest rate swap had a negative fair value of zero and 10 million respectively and is included in accrued liabilities the change in market value during fiscal 2009 and 2008 related to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge was recorded as an unrecognized gain or loss 

  in the accumulated other comprehensive loss section of stockholders’ equity in the balance sheets amounts related to any ineffectiveness which are insignificant are recorded as interest expense 

 

our weighted average debt for fiscal 2009 was 376 million adjusted to exclude the 250 million hedged amount a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a 04 million change to our interest expense for fiscal 2009

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products when lyn kirby our current president and chief executive officer joined us in december 1999 we embarked on a multiyear strategy to understand and embrace what women want in a beauty retailer and transform ulta into the shopping experience that it is today we conducted extensive research and surveys to analyze customer response and our effectiveness in areas such as instore experience merchandise selection salon services and marketing strategies based on our research and customer surveys we pioneered what we believe to be a unique retail approach that focuses on all aspects of how women prefer to shop for beauty products by combining the fundamental elements of a beauty superstore including onestop shopping a compelling value proposition and convenient locations together with an uplifting specialty retail experience through our emphasis on “the four e’s” while we are currently executing on the core elements of our business strategy we plan to continually refine our approach in order to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers 

  our competitive strengths 

 

we believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are critical to our continuing success 

 

differentiated merchandising strategy with broad appeal we believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories price points and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our customers while the products we sell can be found in department stores specialty stores salons drug stores and mass merchandisers we offer all of these products in one retail format so that our customer can find everything she needs in one shopping trip we appeal to a wide range of customers by offering over 500 brands such as bare escentuals cosmetics chanel and estée lauder fragrances l’oréal haircare and cosmetics and paul mitchell haircare we also have private label ulta offerings in key categories because our offerings span a broad array of product categories in prestige mass and salon we appeal to a wide range of customers including women of all ages demographics and lifestyles 

 

our unique customer experience we combine the value and convenience of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer the “four e’s” provide the foundation for our operating strategy we cater to the woman who loves to indulge in shopping for beauty products as well as the woman who is time constrained and comes to the store knowing exactly what she wants our distribution infrastructure consistently delivers a greater than 95 instock rate so our customers know they will find the products they are looking for our welltrained beauty consultants are not commissionbased or branddedicated and therefore can provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to our customers’ needs together with our customer service strategy our store locations layout and design help create our unique retail shopping experience which we believe increases both the frequency and length of our customers’ visits 

 

retail format poised to benefit from shifting channel dynamics over the past several years the approximately 75 billion beauty products and salon services industry has experienced significant changes including a shift in how manufacturers distribute and customers purchase beauty products this has enabled the specialty retail channel in which we operate to grow at a greater rate than the industry overall since at least 2000 we are capitalizing on these trends by offering a primarily offmall serviceoriented specialty retail concept with a comprehensive product mix across categories and price points 

 

loyal and active customer base we have approximately six million customer loyalty program members the majority of whom have shopped at one of our stores within the past 12 months we utilize this valuable proprietary database to drive traffic better understand our customers’ purchasing patterns and support new store site selection we regularly distribute catalogs and newspaper inserts to entertain and educate our customers and most importantly to drive traffic to our stores 

 

strong vendor relationships across product categories we have strong active relationships with over 300 vendors including estée lauder bare escentuals coty l’oréal and procter  gamble we believe the scope and extent of these relationships which span the three distinct beauty categories of prestige mass and salon and have taken years to develop create a significant impediment for other retailers to replicate our model these relationships also frequently afford us the opportunity to work closely with our vendors to market both new and existing brands in a collaborative manner 

 

experienced management team we have an experienced senior management team with extensive beauty and retail experience that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business our senior management team is led by lyn kirby our president and chief executive officer and gregg bodnar our chief financial officer additionally over the past several years we have significantly expanded the depth of our management team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our growth strategy 

  growth strategy 

 

we intend to expand our presence as a leading retailer of beauty products and salon services by 

 

growing our store base we opened 63 stores in fiscal 2008 and 53 stores in fiscal 2007 representing square footage growth of 25 and 28 respectively due to the recent economic downturn the number of highquality commercial real estate projects of the size and with the cotenant mix that we typically target for our new store locations has significantly declined as a result we have reduced our new store program for 2009 to approximately 35 stores representing expected square footage growth of approximately 11 

 

as the economy stabilizes and begins to recover we believe our successful track record of opening new stores in diverse markets across the united states will allow us to increase our new store growth rates back to historical levels consistent with our longterm targets we believe that over the longterm we have the potential to grow our store base to over 1000 ulta stores in the united states our internal real estate model takes into account a number of variables including demographic and sociographic data as well as population density relative to maximum drive times economic and competitive factors we plan to open stores both in markets in which we currently operate and new markets 

 

 

 

increasing our sales and profitability by expanding our prestige brand offerings our strategy is to continue to expand our portfolio of products and brands in particular to enhance our offering of prestige brands both by capitalizing on the success of our existing vendor relationships and by identifying and developing new supply sources we plan to continue to expand and attract additional prestige brands to our stores by increasing education for our beauty consultants providing high levels of customer service and tailoring the presentation and merchandising of these products in our stores to appeal to prestige vendors for example as of january 31 2009 we have installed “boutique” areas of approximately 200 square feet in over 160 of our stores to showcase and build brand equity for key vendors and to provide our customers with a place to experiment and learn about these products we intend to install this feature in most of our stores over time over the last three years we have added several prestige brands including estée lauder fragrance juicy couture and ed hardy fragrances pureology and frédéric fekkai haircare smashbox napoleon perdis and lorac cosmetics and dermalogica skin care we continue to seek opportunities to test prestige brands in our stores in order to expand our prestige brand offerings we believe this strategy will positively influence our number of transactions and our average transaction value 

 

improving our profitability by leveraging our fixed costs we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our existing infrastructure and continually optimizing our operations under normal economic conditions we will continue to make investments in our information systems to enable us to enhance our efficiency in areas such as merchandise planning and allocation inventory management distribution and point of sale pos functions we believe we will continue to improve our profitability by reducing our operating expenses in particular general corporate overhead and fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

 

continuing to enhance our brand awareness to generate sales growth we believe a key component of our success is the brand exposure we get from our marketing initiatives our direct mail advertising programs are designed to drive additional traffic to our stores by highlighting current promotional events and new product offerings our national magazine print advertising campaign exposes potential new customers to our retail 

  concept by conveying an attractive and sophisticated brand message we believe we have an opportunity to increase our instore marketing efforts as an additional means of educating our customers and increasing the frequency of their visits to our stores 

 

driving increased customer traffic to our salons we are committed to establishing ulta as a leading salon authority we seek to increase salon traffic and grow salon revenues by providing high quality and consistent services from our licensed stylists who are knowledgeable about the newest hair fashion trends our objective is to create customer loyalty increase conversion of our retail customers to our salon services encourage referrals and distinguish our salons from those of our competitors our stylists are trained to sell haircare products to their customers by demonstrating the products while styling their customers’ hair additionally we have refined our recruiting methods hiring procedures and training programs to enhance stylist retention which is an important factor in salon productivity 

 

expanding our ecommerce business we launched a new version of our ultacom website and ecommerce platform in november 2007 to enhance the overall ulta experience with greater functionality easeofuse and integration with our customer loyalty programs we intend to establish ourselves over time as a leading online beauty resource for women by providing our customers with information on key trends and products including editorial content expanded assortments and leading website features and functionality through the relaunch of our website and our continued multichannel marketing initiatives we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth of internet sales of beauty products we believe our website and retail stores provide our customers with an integrated multichannel shopping experience and increased flexibility for their beauty buying needs 

 

our market 

 

we operate within the large and steadily growing us beauty products and salon services industry this market represents approximately 75 billion in retail sales according to a 2006 report by kline  company and ibisworld inc the approximately 35 billion beauty products industry includes color cosmetics haircare fragrance bath and body skincare salon styling tools and other toiletries within this market we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige mass and salon products the approximately 40 billion salon services industry consists of hair face and nail services 

 

distribution for beauty products is varied prestige products are typically purchased in department or specialty stores while mass products and staple items are generally purchased at drug stores food retail stores and mass merchandisers in addition salon haircare products are sold in salons and authorized professional retail outlets 

 

competition 

 

our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores such as macy’s and nordstrom specialty stores such as sephora and bath  body works drug stores such as cvspharmacy and walgreens and mass merchandisers such as target and walmart we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services 

 

the market for salon services and products is highly fragmented our competitors for salon services and products include regis corp sally beauty jcpenney salons and independent salons 

 

key trends 

 

we believe an important shift is occurring in the distribution of beauty products department stores which have traditionally been the primary distribution channel for prestige beauty products have been meaningfully affected by changing consumer preferences and industry consolidation over the past decade we believe women particularly younger generations tend to find department stores intimidating highpressured and hinder a multibrand shopping experience and as such are choosing to shop elsewhere for their beauty care needs according to npd 55 of women aged 18 to 24 shop in specialty stores compared to 40 of women 

  aged 18 to 64 over the past ten years department stores have lost significant market share to specialty stores in apparel and we believe the beauty category is undergoing a similar shift in retail channels we believe women are seeking a shopping experience that provides something different a place to experiment learn about various products find what they want and indulge themselves a recent npd study found that nine out of ten women who shop at specialty retailers for beauty products do so because they can touch feel and smell the products 

 

as a result of this market transformation there has been an increase in the number of prestige beauty brands pursuing new distribution channels for their products such as specialty retail spas and salons direct response television ie home shopping and infomercials and the internet in addition many smaller prestige brands are selling their products through these channels due to the high fixed costs associated with operating in most department stores and to capitalize on consumers’ growing propensity to shop in these channels according to industry sources color cosmetics sales through these channels are projected to grow at a higher rate than sales of color cosmetics in total we believe that based on our recent success in attracting new prestige brands we are wellpositioned to continue to capture additional prestige brands as they expand into specialty stores also there are a growing number of brands that have built significant consumer awareness and sales by initially offering their products on direct response television we benefit from offering brands that sell their products through this channel as we experience increased store traffic and sales after these brands appear on television 

 

historically manufacturers have distributed their products through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we believe women are increasingly shopping across retail channels as well as purchasing a combination of prestige and mass beauty products we attribute this trend to a number of factors including the growing availability of prestige brands outside of department stores and increased innovation in mass products based on the competitive environment in which we operate we believe that we have been at the forefront of breaking down the industry’s historical distribution paradigm by combining a wide range of beauty products categories and price points under one roof our strategy reflects a more customercentric model of how women prefer to shop today for their beauty needs 

 

major growth drivers for the industry include favorable consumer spending trends product innovation and growth of certain population segments 

 

  

we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends and capture additional market share in the industry we believe we have demonstrated an ability to provide a differentiated store experience for customers as well as offer a breadth and depth of merchandise previously unavailable from more traditional beauty retailers

store remodel program 

 

our retail store concept including physical layout displays lighting and quality of finishes has continued to evolve over time to match the rising expectations of our customers and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies in recent years our strategic focus has been on refining our new store model improving our real estate selection process and executing on our new store opening program as a result we decided to limit the investments made in our existing store base from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2006 we developed and initiated a store remodel program to update our older stores to provide a consistent shopping experience across all of our locations we remodeled 8 stores in fiscal 2008 and 17 stores in fiscal 2007 we believe this program will improve the appeal of our stores drive additional customer traffic and increase our sales and profitability the remodel store selection process is subject to the same discipline as our new store real estate decision process our focus is to remodel the oldest highest performing stores first subject to criteria such as rate of return lease terms market performance and quality of real estate the average investment to remodel a store in fiscal 2008 was approximately 10 million each remodel takes approximately 13 weeks to complete during which time we typically keep the store open

  availability and cost of credit and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies in the second half of 2008 added concerns fueled by the united states government conservatorship of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association the declared bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc the united states government financial assistance to american international group inc citibank bank of america and other federal government interventions in the united states financial system led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both the united states and international capital and credit markets these conditions combined with volatile oil prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 

 

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending current market and credit conditions could make it more difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary credit to build new retail centers a significant decrease in new retail center development could adversely affect our new store program and limit our future growth opportunities as long as the aforementioned conditions exist continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

 

a further downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary beauty products and salon services which could delay our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

we offer a wide selection of beauty products and premium salon services as the current economic downturn remains uncertain our customers may become more apprehensive about the economy and further reduce their level of discretionary spending across all of our product categories including prestige beauty products and premium salon services additionally the ongoing impacts of the housing crisis rising unemployment financial market volatility the availability of credit and general consumer confidence may worsen and exacerbate current conditions a decrease in spending due to lower consumer discretionary income or consumer confidence could adversely impact our net sales and operating results and could force us to delay or slow our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

additionally the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our product vendors as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located a bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons internet businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand 

  recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales will decrease 

 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

  

if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the regions in which we operate our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team ms kirby our president and chief executive officer since december 1999 is of key importance to our business including her relationships with our vendors and influence on our sales and marketing if we lost ms kirby’s services or if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of other key executive and buying personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ms kirby has entered an agreement to remain employed with us through march 2011 furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates and to attract motivate and retain additional qualified managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

 

we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis during fiscal 2008 we opened 63 new stores we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future and believe we have the longterm potential to grow our store base to over 1000 stores in the united states during fiscal 2008 the average investment required to open a typical new store was approximately 15 million this continued expansion could place increased demands on our financial managerial operational and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance and slow our growth 

 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these 

  plans or cause us to incur costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate two distribution facilities which house the distribution operations for ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business in order to support our recent and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business additional distribution centers may need to be added in the future our failure to expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

any significant interruption in the operations of our two distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying over 21000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our distribution infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations 

 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our ecommerce business we have identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth the failure of our information systems to perform as designed including the failure of our warehouse management software system to operate as expected during the holiday season could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations shipment of goods ability to process financial information and credit card transactions and our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders or engage in normal business activities moreover security breaches or leaks of proprietary information including leaks of customers’ private data could result in liability decrease customer confidence in our company and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our ecommerce operations while relatively small are increasingly important to our business the ultacom website serves as an effective extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

 

we directly source the majority of our giftwithpurchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and 

  deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors which are beyond our control and these factors could materially hurt our business financial condition and results of operations or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers or lifestyle centers which also accommodate other wellknown destination retailers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants while lifestyle centers typically contain a variety of highend destination retailers but no large anchor stores as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in the lifestyle centers and power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center or lifestyle center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income this risk is more pronounced during the current severe economic downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers filing for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed consumer spending levels 

 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

  we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendors were unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position our business and financial performance 

 

we have no longterm supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

 

during fiscal 2008 merchandise supplied to ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 48 of our net sales the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendors could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name “ulta” and other marks incorporating that name copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under the fdc act may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however the fda may in the future determine to regulate our cosmetics or the ingredients included in our cosmetics as drugs these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely 

  damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

 

  

in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including the fda the ftc and state attorneys general in the united states if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties or claims which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our ulta product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising by us may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

 

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior buildout of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which 

  we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes which increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

 

our ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources further we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment in which case our creditors could levy against our assets these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors 

  may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could hurt our profitability 

 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which will reduce our profitability 

 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs would reduce our profitability to the extent that we are unable to offset those increases by raising selling prices or by reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions 

 

our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

 

we have a 200 million secured revolving credit facility or credit facility with a term expiring may 2011 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the eurodollar rate plus 100 up to 100 million and 125 thereafter the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things restrict our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment in addition when our current facility matures in may 2011 we may be unable to obtain similar terms on a new credit facility due to the uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets 

 

we will need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy or continue our operations and we may be unable to raise capital when needed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

from time to time we will seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth strategy in addition if general economic financial or political conditions in our markets change or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs if financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer 

  failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses 

 

reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems processes and controls as well as on our personnel in addition as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as a result we have been required to improve our financial and managerial controls reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 

 

we are currently subject to a consolidated securities class action lawsuit the outcome of which is uncertain 

 

we and certain of our current and former executive officers are defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit in federal court see item 3 “legal proceedings” for a more detailed description of these proceedings this putative class action remains in its preliminary stages and it is not yet possible to determine the ultimate outcome the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit seek substantial damages the legal and other costs associated with the defense of this action the amount of time required to be spent by management and the board of directors on this matter and the ultimate outcome of the litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

 

 23 

   

in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

 

our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

 

our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of other factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

  

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock would likely decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

our current principal stockholders have significant influence over us and they could delay deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree 

 

our principal stockholders own or control in the aggregate approximately 44 of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions and will have significant influence over our management and policies such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders in addition the significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with stockholders holding such significant influence 

 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and 

  harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

  

as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock

although we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this lawsuit an adverse resolution may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to the lawsuit 

 

general litigation — we are also involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business including but not limited to employment related claims in the opinion of management the amount of any liability with respect to these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will not be material

overview 

 

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through separate distribution channels in 1999 we embarked on a multiyear strategy to understand and embrace what women want in a beauty retailer and transform ulta into the shopping experience that it is 

  today we pioneered what we believe to be our unique combination of beauty superstore and specialty store attributes we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance 

 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides onestop shopping for prestige mass and salon products and salon services in the united states we combine the unique elements of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our beauty superstore strategy include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of over 21000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as salon haircare products we focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories our stores are conveniently located in hightraffic primarily offmall locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers as of january 31 2009 we operated 311 stores across 36 states in addition to these fundamental elements of a beauty superstore we strive to offer an uplifting shopping experience through what we refer to as “the four e’s” escape education entertainment and esthetics 

 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our growth strategy including growing our store base expanding our prestige brand offerings driving incremental salon traffic expanding our online business and continuing to enhance our brand awareness we believe that the steadily expanding us beauty products and services industry the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy 

 

comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry we do not expect our future comparable store sales increases to reflect the levels experienced in prior periods this is due in part to the difficulty in improving on such significant increases in subsequent periods and the current economic environment 

 

the company adopted a structured stock option compensation program in july 2007 the award of stock options under this program will result in increased stockbased compensation expense in future periods as compared to the expense reflected in our historical financial statements 

 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to be relatively consistent with historical rates given our planned distribution infrastructure investments and the impact of the rate of new store growth we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and decreasing our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales 

 

on october 30 2007 we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 7666667 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 1235 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses selling stockholders sold 2153928 additional shares of common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders we used the net proceeds from the offering to pay 930 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock which satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends 48 million to redeem our series iii preferred stock and 257 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes also in connection with the offering we converted preferred shares into 41524002 common shares and restated the par value of our common stock to 001 per share 

 

global economic conditions 

 

recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into 2009 as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases 

  cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have lead to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

 

current business trends 

 

during fiscal 2008 we experienced a deceleration of our comparable store sales increases our comparable store increases for the first second and third quarters of fiscal 2008 were 39 37 and 20 respectively the deceleration was especially apparent during the fourth quarter when we reported a comparable store sales decrease of 55 we believe that the deterioration of the us economy was the primary contributing factor to our comparable store sales deceleration throughout fiscal 2008 we experienced relative decreases in both the retail products and salon services areas of our business as consumers decreased spending on beauty products or deferred salon services as we began fiscal 2009 we have experienced a slight decrease in our comparable store sales trend which we believe reflects a continuation of the negative consumer sentiment due to the difficult economic environment we expect this trend to continue and expect that our comparable store sales will be negatively affected during fiscal 2009 

 

the level of comparable store sales increase or decrease during a period affects our earnings and ability to leverage fixed costs during fiscal 2008 as we saw the economic conditions worsen we took steps to manage our cost structure and mitigate the earnings impacts we were able to mitigate the earnings impact of the decelerating comparable store sales increases to a considerable degree and were able to slightly leverage our selling general and administrative costs 

 

in response to the continuing difficult economic environment management has developed a number of initiatives focused on maximizing cash flow including reducing our capital expenditures by reducing our new store growth plans expense management and improving working capital utilization by decreasing merchandise inventory levels 

 

basis of presentation 

 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue salon service revenue represents less than 10 of our combined product sales and services revenues and therefore these revenues are combined with product sales we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale pos in our retail stores and the time of shipment in the case of internet sales merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

 

comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales as a result data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 

  comparable store sales is a critical measure that allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results 

 

  

cost of sales includes 

 

  

our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores we also expect that cost of sales as a percentage of net sales will be negatively impacted in the next several years as a result of accelerated depreciation related to our store remodel program the program was adopted in third quarter fiscal 2006 we have accelerated depreciation expense on assets to be disposed of during the remodel process such that those assets will be fully depreciated at the time of the planned remodel changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales 

 

this presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include 

 

  

this presentation of items in selling general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling general and administrative expenses 

  preopening expense includes noncapital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new and remodeled stores including store setup labor management and employee training and grand opening advertising preopening expenses also includes rent during the construction period related to new stores 

 

interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facility which is structured as an asset based lending instrument our interest expense will fluctuate based on the seasonal borrowing requirements associated with acquiring inventory in advance of key holiday selling periods and fluctuation in the variable interest rates we are charged on outstanding balances our credit facility is used to fund seasonal inventory needs and new and remodel store capital requirements in excess of our cash flow from operations our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates 

 

income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores 

 

results of operations 

 

our fiscal years are the 52 or 53 week periods ending on the saturday closest to january 31 the company’s fiscal years ended january 31 2009 february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 were 52 52 and 53 week years respectively and are hereafter referred to as fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006

net sales 

 

net sales increased 1725 million or 189 to 10846 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 9121 million in fiscal 2007 this increase is due to the opening of 62 net new stores in 2008 and a 02 increase in comparable store sales noncomparable stores which include stores opened in fiscal 2008 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2007 which have not yet turned comparable contributed 1707 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed 18 million of the total net sales increase fiscal 2008 comparable store sales were significantly affected by the 55 decrease in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter we believe the continuing deterioration and uncertainty in the united states economy were significant contributing factors to our decreasing comparable store sales during fiscal 2008 especially during the holiday season when consumers significantly reduced discretionary spending 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit increased 443 million or 156 to 3279 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 2836 million in fiscal 2007 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points to 302 in fiscal 2008 compared to 311 in fiscal 2007 gross profit in fiscal 2008 was impacted by

interest expense 

 

interest expense decreased 06 million or 132 to 39 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 45 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 200 basis point decrease in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variable rate credit facility during fiscal 2008 partially offset by increased borrowings 

 

income tax expense 

 

income tax expense of 171 million in fiscal 2008 represents an effective tax rate of 403 compared to fiscal 2007 tax expense of 168 million which represents an effective tax rate of 399 the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in nondeductible stock compensation expense 

 

net income 

 

net income in fiscal 2008 was flat in comparison to fiscal 2007 net income was impacted by an increase in gross profit of 443 million which was offset by increases in selling general and administrative expenses and preopening expenses 

 

fiscal year 2007 versus fiscal year 2006 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased 1570 million or 208 to 9121 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 7551 million in fiscal 2006 fiscal 2006 was a 53week operating year and the 53rd week represented approximately 164 million in net sales adjusted for the 53rd week fiscal 2007 net sales increased 1734 million or 235 compared to fiscal 2006 this increase is due to the opening of 53 new stores in 2007 and a 64 increase in comparable store sales noncomparable stores which include stores opened in fiscal 2007 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2006 which have not yet turned comparable contributed 1279 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed 455 million of the total net sales increase our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2007 was driven by a balance in growth of customer traffic and average transaction value we attribute these results to the continued effectiveness of our marketing strategy particularly in a difficult holiday season and doubledigit growth in our prestige cosmetics category consistent with our growth strategy 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit increased 484 million or 206 to 2836 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 2352 million in fiscal 2006 gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 311 in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 gross profit in fiscal 2007 was impacted by

interest expense 

 

interest expense increased 12 million or 371 to 45 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 33 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to a 270 million increase in the average debt outstanding on our variable rate credit facility during fiscal 2007 

 

income tax expense 

 

income tax expense of 168 million in fiscal 2007 represents an effective tax rate of 399 compared to fiscal 2006 tax expense of 142 million which represents an effective tax rate of 387 the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an adjustment in fiscal 2006 to reflect the benefit of state tax effects of our net operating loss carry forwards 

 

net income 

 

net income increased 28 million or 124 to 253 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 225 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in net income of 28 million resulted from an increase in gross profit of 484 million driven by a comparable store sales increase of 64 the increase in gross profit was partially offset by a 372 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses and a 47 million increase in preopening expenses 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors 

 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at 

  maximum investment levels in our new store class and have not yet collected landlord allowances due us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

 

on october 30 2007 we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 7666667 shares of common stock to the public at a price of 1800 per share resulting in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock of 1380 million selling stockholders sold 2153928 additional shares of common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders the aggregate net proceeds to us were 1235 million after deducting 97 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and 47 million in offering expenses we used the net proceeds from the offering to pay 930 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock which satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends 48 million to redeem our series iii preferred stock and 257 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes also in connection with the offering we converted preferred shares into 41524002 common shares and restated the par value of our common stock to 001 per share 

 

the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation realized losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

 

merchandise inventories were 2136 million at january 31 2009 an increase of 375 million compared to the prior year end the increase is primarily related to the addition of 62 net new stores opened during fiscal 2008 average inventory per store decreased approximately 29 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

income taxes were prepaid by 86 million at january 31 2009 compared to an accrual of 51 million at february 2 2008 the change of 137 million is due to the impact of newly enacted tax legislation and tax accounting method changes during fiscal 2008 which resulted in accelerating certain expenses for tax purposes these items created a 226 million increase in deferred income taxes reducing our fiscal 2008 taxable income and resulting in a prepaid income tax asset being recognized during the fourth quarter we expect a refund of 60 million of the prepaid income tax during the first half of fiscal 2009 with the remainder being applied to fiscal 2009 tax liabilities 

 

deferred rent liabilities were 1013 million at january 31 2009 an increase of 301 million compared to the prior year end deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straightline basis over their respective lease term the increase is due to fiscal 2008 activity which includes 63 new stores our new phoenix distribution center and new corporate office space 

  investing activities 

 

we have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures were 1109 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 1019 million and 623 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively capital expenditures were higher during fiscal 2008 due to the addition of a second distribution center and the number of new store openings 63 new stores were opened during fiscal 2008 compared to 53 new stores during fiscal 2007 and 31 new stores during fiscal 2006 

 

during fiscal 2006 our chief executive officer exercised stock options in exchange for a promissory note for 41 million the company withheld 24 million of payrollrelated taxes in connection with the exercised options and that portion of the note has been classified as an investing activity in fiscal 2006 the remainder of the promissory note of 17 million related to exercise proceeds of the options and was classified as a noncash financing activity the note was paid in full on june 29 2007 

 

financing activities 

 

financing activities consist principally of draws and payments on our credit facility and capital stock transactions the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities of 151 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily the result of 257 million of net proceeds from the company’s initial public offering in fiscal 2007 this was partially offset by a 73 million increase in longterm borrowings in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in new store capital expenditures and merchandise inventories the remaining difference is related to capital stock transactions 

 

credit facility 

 

our credit facility is with lasalle bank national association as the administrative agent wachovia capital finance corporation as collateral agent and jp morgan chase bank as documentation agent this facility provides maximum credit of 200 million through may 31 2011 the credit facility agreement contains a restrictive financial covenant requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of not less than 80 million on january 31 2009 our tangible net worth was approximately 245 million substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the eurodollar rate plus 100 up to 100 million and 125 thereafter the advance rates on owned inventory are 80 85 from september 1 to january 31 

 

the interest rate on the outstanding balances under the facility as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 was 152 and 481 respectively at january 31 2009 we had 1060 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility we have classified 880 million as longterm as this is the minimum amount we believe will remain outstanding for an uninterrupted period over the next year we had approximately 868 million and 731 million excluding the accordion option which was exercised on august 15 2008 of availability as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 respectively 

 

we also have an ongoing letter of credit that renews annually which had a balance of 03 million as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 

 

seasonality 

 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentines’ day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

  impact of inflation and changing prices 

 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations and letters of credit we do not have any noncancelable purchase commitments as of january 31 2009 our letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility were 03 million as of january 31 2009 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2019 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of january 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principals gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and 

  judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

inventory valuation 

 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

 

adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health workers’ compensation and general liability insurance we maintain stop loss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our liability exposure current stop loss coverage is 150000 for health claims 100000 for general liability claims and 250000 for workers’ compensation claims management estimates undiscounted loss reserves associated with these liabilities in part by considering historical claims experience industry factors and other actuarial assumptions including information provided by third parties selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 were 19 million 24 million and 23 million respectively adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of these reserves have been insignificant for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified which is the store level significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

effective january 29 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment  pursuant to sfas no 123r sharebased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest as a nonpublic entity that previously used the minimum value method for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 123 we were required to adopt the prospective method of accounting under sfas no 123r under this transitional method we record compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income for all awards granted after 

  the adoption date and to awards modified repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date using the fair value provisions of sfas no 123r 

 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on volatilities of a peer group of publiclytraded companies the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding we have elected to use the shortcut approach in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 107 sharebased payment and sab no 110 simplified method for plain vanilla share options to develop the expected life we recognize compensation cost related to the stock options on a straightline method over the requisite service period 

 

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 for financial assets and liabilities and recurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities the fasb has provided a one year deferral for all nonfinancial and nonrecurring assets and liabilities we will adopt sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of sfas no 133 sfas no 161 is intended to help investors better understand how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows through enhanced disclosure requirements the enhanced disclosures primarily surround disclosing the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments by their underlying risk as well as a tabular format of the fair values of the derivative instruments and their gains and losses sfas no 161 is effective for quarterly interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 and fiscal years that include those quarterly interim periods we will adopt sfas no 161 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as it is disclosureonly in nature

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

 

interest rate sensitivity 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowing under our credit facility interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates we have an interest rate swap agreement in place with a notional amount of 250 million which effectively converts variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at an interest rate of 511 the interest rate swap reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 had a negative fair value of 10 million and 12 million respectively and is included in accrued liabilities the interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of which is recorded as an unrecognized gain loss in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity our weighted average debt for fiscal 2008 was 830 million adjusted for the 250 million hedged amount a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a 08 million change to our interest expense for fiscal 2008

our value proposition we believe our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories is fundamental to our customer loyalty for example we run frequent promotions and gift coupons for our mass brands giftwithpurchase offers and multiproduct gift sets for our prestige brands and a comprehensive customer loyalty program 

an offmall location we are conveniently located in hightraffic primarily offmall locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers our typical store is approximately 10000 square feet including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our fullservice salon our displays store design and open layout allow us the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy 

in addition to the fundamental elements of a beauty superstore we strive to offer an uplifting shopping experience through what we refer to as “the four e’s” escape education entertainment and esthetics 

escape we strive to offer our customers a timely escape from the stresses of daily life in a welcoming and approachable environment our customer can immerse herself in our extensive product selection indulge herself in our hair or skin treatments or discover new and exciting products in an interactive setting we provide a shopping experience without the intimidating commissionoriented and branddedicated sales approach that we believe is found in most department stores and with a level of service that we believe is typically unavailable in drug stores and mass merchandisers 

education we staff our stores with a team of welltrained beauty consultants and professionally licensed estheticians and stylists whose mission is to educate inform and advise our customers regarding their beauty needs we also provide product education through demonstrations instore videos and informational displays our focus on educating our customer reinforces our authority as her primary resource for beauty products and our credibility as a provider of consistent highquality salon services our beauty consultants are trained to service customers across all prestige lines and within our prestige “boutiques” where customers can receive a makeover or skin analysis 

  entertainment the entertainment experience for our customer begins at home when she receives our catalogs our catalogs are designed to introduce our customers to our newest products and promotions and to be invitations to come to ulta to play touch test learn and explore a significant percentage of our sales throughout the year is derived from new products making every visit to ulta an opportunity to discover something new and exciting in addition to providing approximately 3900 testers in categories such as fragrance cosmetics skincare and salon styling tools we further enhance the shopping experience and store atmosphere through live demonstrations from our licensed salon professionals and beauty consultants and through customer makeovers and instore videos 

esthetics we strive to create a visually pleasing and inviting store and salon environment that exemplifies and reinforces the quality of our products and services our stores are brightly lit spacious and attractive on the inside and outside of the store our store and salon design features sleek modern lines that reinforce our status as a fashion authority together with wide aisles that make the store easy to navigate and pleasant lighting to create a luxurious and welcoming environment this strategy enables us to provide an extensive product selection in a wellorganized store and to offer a salon experience that is both fashionable and contemporary 

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products when lyn kirby our current president and chief executive officer joined us in december 1999 we embarked on a multiyear strategy to understand and embrace what women want in a beauty retailer and transform ulta into the shopping experience that it is today we conducted extensive research and surveys to analyze customer response and our effectiveness in areas such as instore experience merchandise selection salon services and marketing strategies based on our research and customer surveys we pioneered what we believe to be a unique retail approach that focuses on all aspects of how women prefer to shop for beauty products by combining the fundamental elements of a beauty superstore including onestop shopping a compelling value proposition and convenient locations together with an uplifting specialty retail experience through our emphasis on “the four e’s” while we are currently executing on the core elements of our business strategy we plan to continually refine our approach in order to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are critical to our continuing success 

differentiated merchandising strategy with broad appeal we believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories price points and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our customers while the products we sell can be found in department stores specialty stores salons drug stores and mass merchandisers we offer all of these products in one retail format so that our customer can find everything she needs in one shopping trip we appeal to a wide range of customers by offering over 500 brands such as bare escentuals cosmetics chanel and estée lauder fragrances l’oréal haircare and cosmetics and paul mitchell haircare we also have private label ulta offerings in key categories because our offerings span a broad array of product categories in prestige mass and salon we appeal to a wide range of customers including women of all ages demographics and lifestyles 

our unique customer experience we combine the value and convenience of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer the “four e’s” provide the foundation for our operating strategy we cater to the woman who loves to indulge in shopping for beauty products as well as the woman who is time constrained and comes to the store knowing exactly what she wants our distribution infrastructure consistently delivers a greater than 95 instock rate so our customers know they will find the products they are looking for our welltrained beauty consultants are not commissionbased or branddedicated and therefore can provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to our customers’ needs together with our customer service strategy our store locations layout and design help create our unique retail shopping experience which we believe increases both the frequency and length of our customers’ visits 

retail format poised to benefit from shifting channel dynamics  over the past several years the approximately 75 billion beauty products and salon services industry has experienced significant changes including a shift in how manufacturers distribute and customers purchase beauty products this has enabled the specialty retail channel in which we operate to grow at a greater rate than the industry overall since at least 2000 we are capitalizing on these trends by offering a primarily offmall serviceoriented specialty retail concept with a comprehensive product mix across categories and price points 

loyal and active customer base  we have approximately six million customer loyalty program members the majority of whom have shopped at one of our stores within the past 12 months we utilize this valuable proprietary database to drive traffic better understand our customers’ purchasing patterns and support new store site selection we regularly distribute catalogs and newspaper inserts to entertain and educate our customers and most importantly to drive traffic to our stores 

  strong vendor relationships across product categories we have strong active relationships with over 300 vendors including estée lauder bare escentuals coty l’oréal and procter  gamble we believe the scope and extent of these relationships which span the three distinct beauty categories of prestige mass and salon and have taken years to develop create a significant impediment for other retailers to replicate our model these relationships also frequently afford us the opportunity to work closely with our vendors to market both new and existing brands in a collaborative manner 

experienced management team  we have an experienced senior management team with extensive beauty and retail experience that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business our senior management team is led by lyn kirby our president and chief executive officer and gregg bodnar our chief financial officer additionally over the past three years we have significantly expanded the depth of our management team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our growth strategy 

growth strategy 

we intend to expand our presence as a leading retailer of beauty products and salon services by 

growing our store base to our longterm potential of over 1000 stores we believe our successful track record of opening new stores in diverse markets throughout the united states demonstrates the portability and growth potential of our retail concept 

 

   

 

increasing our sales and profitability by expanding our prestige brand offerings our strategy is to continue to expand our portfolio of products and brands in particular to enhance our offering of prestige brands both by capitalizing on the success of our existing vendor relationships and by identifying and developing new supply sources we plan to continue to expand and attract additional prestige brands to our stores by increasing education for our beauty consultants providing high levels of customer service and tailoring the presentation and merchandising of these products in our stores to appeal to prestige vendors for example as of february 2 2008 we have installed “boutique” areas of approximately 200 square feet in over 90 of our stores to showcase and build brand equity for key vendors and to provide our customers with a place to experiment and learn about these products we intend to install this feature in most of our stores over time over the last three years we have added several prestige brands including estée lauder fragrance frédéric fekkai and nick chavez haircare smashbox and stila cosmetics dermalogica skin care and t3 salon styling tools we believe this strategy will result in a continued increase in our number of transactions and our average transaction value 

improving our profitability by leveraging our fixed costs we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our existing infrastructure and continually optimizing our operations we will continue to make investments in our information systems to enable us to enhance our efficiency in areas such as merchandise planning and allocation inventory management distribution and point of sale pos functions we believe we will continue to improve our profitability by reducing our operating expenses in particular general corporate overhead and fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

continuing to enhance our brand awareness to generate sales growth we believe a key component of our success is the brand exposure we get from our marketing initiatives our direct mail advertising programs are designed to drive additional traffic to our stores by highlighting current promotional events and new product offerings our national magazine print advertising campaign exposes potential new customers to our retail concept by conveying an attractive and sophisticated brand message we believe we have an opportunity to increase our instore marketing efforts as an additional means of educating our customers and increasing the frequency of their visits to our stores 

driving increased customer traffic to our salons we are committed to establishing ulta as a leading salon authority we seek to increase salon traffic and grow salon revenues by providing high quality and consistent services from our licensed stylists who are knowledgeable about the newest hair fashion trends our objective is to create customer loyalty increase conversion of our retail customers to our salon services encourage referrals and distinguish our salons from those of our competitors our stylists are trained to sell haircare products to their customers by demonstrating the products while styling their customers’ hair additionally we have refined our recruiting methods hiring procedures and training programs to enhance stylist retention which is an important factor in salon productivity 

expanding our ecommerce business we launched a new version of our ultacom website and ecommerce platform in november 2007 to enhance the overall ulta experience with greater functionality easeofuse and integration with our customer loyalty program we also intend to establish ourselves over time as a leading online beauty resource for women by providing our customers with information on key trends and products including editorial content expanded assortments and leading website features and functionality  through the relaunch of our website and our multichannel marketing initiatives we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth of internet sales of beauty products we believe our website and retail stores provide our customers with an integrated multichannel shopping experience and increased flexibility for their beauty buying needs 

  our market 

we operate within the large and steadily growing us beauty products and salon services industry this market represents approximately 75 billion in retail sales according to kline  company and ibisworld inc the approximately 35 billion beauty products industry includes color cosmetics haircare fragrance bath and body skincare salon styling tools and other toiletries within this market we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige mass and salon products the approximately 40 billion salon services industry consists of hair face and nail services 

distribution for beauty products is varied prestige products are typically purchased in department or specialty stores while mass products and staple items are generally purchased at drug stores food retail stores and mass merchandisers in addition salon haircare products are sold in salons and authorized professional retail outlets 

competition 

our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores such as macy’s and nordstrom specialty stores such as sephora and bath  body works drug stores such as cvspharmacy and walgreens and mass merchandisers such as target and walmart we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services 

the market for salon services and products is highly fragmented our competitors for salon services and products include regis corp sally beauty jcpenney salons and independent salons 

key trends 

we believe an important shift is occurring in the distribution of beauty products department stores which have traditionally been the primary distribution channel for prestige beauty products have been meaningfully affected by changing consumer preferences and industry consolidation over the past decade we believe women particularly younger generations tend to find department stores intimidating highpressured and hinder a multibrand shopping experience and as such are choosing to shop elsewhere for their beauty care needs according to npd 55 of women aged 18 to 24 shop in specialty stores compared to 40 of women aged 18 to 64 over the past ten years department stores have lost significant market share to specialty stores in apparel and we believe the beauty category is undergoing a similar shift in retail channels we believe women are seeking a shopping experience that provides something different a place to experiment learn about various products find what they want and indulge themselves a recent npd study found that nine out of ten women who shop at specialty retailers for beauty products do so because they can touch feel and smell the products 

as a result of this market transformation there has been an increase in the number of prestige beauty brands pursuing new distribution channels for their products such as specialty retail spas and salons direct response television ie home shopping and infomercials and the internet in addition many smaller prestige brands are selling their products through these channels due to the high fixed costs associated with operating in most department stores and to capitalize on consumers’ growing propensity to shop in these channels according to industry sources color cosmetics sales through these channels are projected to grow at a higher rate than sales of color cosmetics in total we believe that based on our recent success in attracting new prestige brands we are wellpositioned to continue to capture additional prestige brands as they expand into specialty stores also there are a growing number of brands that have built significant consumer awareness and sales by initially offering their products on direct response television we benefit from offering brands that sell their products through this channel as we experience increased store traffic and sales after these brands appear on television 

historically manufacturers have distributed their products through distinct channels—department stores for prestige products drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products we believe women are increasingly shopping across retail channels as well as purchasing a combination of prestige and mass beauty products we attribute this trend to a number of factors including the growing availability of prestige brands outside of department stores and increased innovation in mass products based on the competitive environment in which we operate we believe that we have been at the forefront of breaking down the industry’s historical distribution paradigm by combining a wide range of beauty products categories and price points under one roof our strategy reflects a more customercentric model of how women prefer to shop today for their beauty needs 

major growth drivers for the industry include favorable consumer spending trends product innovation and growth of certain population segments 

   

we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends and capture additional market share in the industry we believe we have demonstrated an ability to provide a differentiated store experience for customers as well as offer a breadth and depth of merchandise previously unavailable from more traditional beauty retailers

we are conveniently located in hightraffic primarily offmall locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers our typical store is approximately 10000 square feet including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our fullservice salon we opened 53 stores in fiscal 2007 and 31 stores in fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2007 the average investment required to open a new ulta store was approximately 15 million which includes capital investments net of landlord contributions preopening expenses and initial inventory net of payables however our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors including geographic location as of february 2 2008 we operated 249 stores in 31 states 

store remodel program 

our retail store concept including physical layout displays lighting and quality of finishes has continued to evolve over time to match the rising expectations of our customers and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies in recent years our strategic focus has been on refining our new store model improving our real estate selection process and executing on our new store opening program as a result we decided to limit the investments made in our existing store base from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2006 we developed and initiated a store remodel program to update our older stores to provide a consistent shopping experience across all of our locations we remodeled 17 stores in fiscal 2007 and 7 stores in fiscal 2006 we believe this program will improve the appeal of our stores drive additional customer traffic and increase our sales and profitability the remodel store selection process is subject to the same discipline as our new store real estate decision process our focus is to remodel the oldest highest performing stores first subject to criteria such as rate of return lease terms market performance and quality of real estate the average investment to remodel a store in fiscal 2007 was approximately 10 million each remodel takes approximately 13 weeks to complete during which time we typically keep the store open

we work with over 300 vendors each merchandising vice president has over 15 years of experience developing relationships in the industry with which he or she works we have no longterm supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with our vendors our top ten vendors represent approximately 45 of our total annual sales these include vendors across all product categories such as bare escentuals farouk systems helen of troy l’oréal and procter  gamble among others we have “toptotop” meetings with each of these vendors at least once a year which in most instances includes our chief executive officer and the vendor’s senior management team we believe our vendors view us as a significant distribution channel for growth and brand enhancement 

marketing and advertising 

marketing strategy 

we employ a multifaceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to our stores our marketing strategy complements a basic tenet of our business strategy which is to provide our customers with a satisfying and uplifting experience we communicate this vision through a multimedia approach our primary media expenditure is in direct mail catalogs and freestanding newspaper inserts these vehicles allow the customer to see the breadth of our selection of prestige mass and salon beauty products 

in order to reach new customers and to establish ulta as a national brand we advertise in national magazines such as instyle allure lucky elle and vanity fair these advertising channels have proven successful in raising our brand awareness on a national level and driving additional sales from both existing and new customers in conjunction with our national brand advertising we have initiated a public relations strategy that focuses on reaching top tier magazine editors to ensure consistent messaging in beauty magazines as well as directtocustomer efforts through multimedia channels 

our ecommerce advertising strategy complements our print media strategy we send out email distributions to our key customers and we integrate promotional messaging in banner advertising during certain times of the year 

customer loyalty programs — the club at ulta 

the strategy of our customer loyalty program which we initiated in 1996 is to engage motivate and reward existing ulta customers while increasing our customer count and sales we have approximately six million customer loyalty program members the majority of whom have shopped at one of our stores within the past 12 months customers sign up to become members instore and receive free gifts four times a year with the value of such gifts based on customers’ spending levels we also send reward certificates to members in our catalogs 

staffing and operations 

retail 

our current ulta store format is typically staffed with a general manager a salon manager four assistant managers and approximately twenty full and parttime associates including approximately six to eight beauty consultants and eight to fifteen licensed salon professionals the management team in each store reports to the general manager the general manager oversees all store activities 

  and salon management which include inventory management merchandising cash management scheduling hiring and guest services members of store management receive bonuses depending on their position and on sales shrink payroll or a combination of these three factors each general manager reports to a district manager who in turn reports to the vice president of operations east the vice president of operations west or the senior vice president of operations the senior vice president of operations reports to our chief executive officer each store team receives additional support from time to time from recruiting specialists for the retail and salon operations a field loss prevention team market trainers and management trainers 

ulta stores are open seven days a week 11 hours a day monday through saturday and seven hours on sunday our stores have extended hours during the holiday season 

salon 

a typical salon is staffed with eight to fifteen licensed salon professionals including one salon manager eight to twelve stylists and one to two estheticians our higher producing salons may also have a salon coordinator and assistant manager our training teams vendor education classes and leadership conferences create a comprehensive educational program for our approximately 2200 salon professionals 

training and development 

our success is dependent in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate qualified employees at all levels of the organization we have developed a corporate culture that enables individual store managers to make storelevel operating decisions and consistently rewards their success we are committed to improving the skills and careers of our workforce and providing advancement opportunities for our associates our associates and regional managers are essential to our store expansion strategy we primarily use existing managers or promote from within to support our new stores although many outlying stores have allnew teams 

all of our associates participate in an interactive newhire orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with ulta’s vision and mission training for new store managers beauty consultants and sales associates familiarizes them with opening and closing routines guest service expectations our loss prevention policy and procedures and our culture we also have ongoing development programs that include operational training for hourly associates beauty consultants management and stylists we provide continuing education to both salon professionals and retail associates throughout their careers at ulta to enable them to deliver the “four e’s” to our customers in contrast to the sales teams at traditional department stores our sales teams are not commissioned or branddedicated our beauty consultants are trained to work across all prestige lines and within our prestige “boutiques” where customers can receive a makeover or skin analysis 

distribution 

we operate two distribution facilities the first facility located in romeoville illinois is approximately 317000 square feet in size including an overflow facility we recently began operating a second distribution facility in phoenix arizona that is approximately 330000 square feet in size we are currently receiving vendor product at the new facility and expect to begin shipping to our phoenix arizona stores beginning in late april 2008 

inventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution facilities we carry over 21000 products and replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches ie lessthancase quantities which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is needed our distribution facilities use a warehouse management software system which was upgraded in early 2007 products are barcoded and scanned using handheld radiofrequency devices as they move within the warehouse to ensure accuracy product is delivered to stores using contract carriers one vendor currently provides storeready orders that can be quickly forwarded to our stores we use advance ship notices asns and carton barcode labels to facilitate these shipments 

information technology 

we are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position we depend on a variety of information systems and technologies to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing store base we rely on computer systems to provide information for all areas of our business including supply chain merchandising pos electronic commerce finance accounting and human resources our core business systems consist mostly of a purchased software program that integrates with our internally developed software solutions our technology also includes a companywide network that connects all corporate users stores and our distribution infrastructure and provides communications for credit card and daily polling of sales and merchandise movement at the store level we intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems people and processes we update the technology supporting our 

  stores distribution infrastructure and corporate headquarters on a continual basis we will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate our growth and enable us to enhance our competitive position 

intellectual property 

we have registered a number of trademarks in the united states including ulta salon cosmetics fragrance and design ultacom ulta beauty and two related designs and several brands and service marks the renewal dates for these marks are january 22 2012 october 8 2012 july 10 2017 and october 16 2017 respectively all marks that are deemed material to our business have been protected in the united states canada and select foreign countries 

we believe our trademarks especially those related to the ulta concept have significant value and are important to building brand recognition 

government regulation 

in our us markets we are affected by extensive laws governmental regulations administrative determinations court decisions and similar constraints such laws regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal state or local levels in the united states our ulta branded products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration fda the federal trade commission ftc and state attorneys general in the united states such regulations principally relate to the safety of our ingredients proper labeling advertising packaging and marketing of our products 

products classified as cosmetics as defined in the food drug and cosmetic fdc act are not subject to premarket approval by the fda but the products and the ingredients must be tested to ensure safety the fda also utilizes an “intended use” doctrine to determine whether a product is a drug or cosmetic by the labeling claims made for the product certain ingredients commonly used in cosmetics products such as sunscreens and acne treatment ingredients are classified as overthecounter drugs which have specific label requirements and allowable claims the labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the requirements of the fdc act the fair packaging and labeling act and other fda regulations 

the government regulations that most impact our daytoday operations are the labor and employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject we are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws both federal and state our salon business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon procedures 

in our store leases we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use but at times the responsibility of obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or buildouts that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or buildouts 

associates 

as of february 2 2008 we employed approximately 4000 people on a fulltime basis and approximately 3900 on a parttime basis we have no collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relationships with our associates

 item 1a risk factors 

investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this form 10k before making an investment decision if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or future growth could suffer in these circumstances the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect our company 

we may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets 

the markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry we compete against a diverse group of retailers both small and large including regional and national department stores specialty retailers drug stores mass merchandisers highend and discount salon chains locally owned beauty retailers and salons internet businesses catalog retailers and direct response television including television home shopping retailers and infomercials we believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of merchandise our value proposition the quality of our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our stores as onestop destinations for beauty products and salon services many of our competitors are and many of our potential competitors may be larger and have greater financial marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can as a result we may lose market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner our sales will decrease 

we believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to 

 

if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the regions in which we operate our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slowmoving merchandise either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to retain our existing senior management team or to attract qualified new personnel such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization this execution requires an experienced and talented management team ms kirby our president and chief executive officer since december 1999 is of key importance to our business including her relationships with our vendors and influence on our sales and marketing if we lost ms kirby’s services or if we were to lose the benefit of the experience efforts and abilities of other key executive and buying personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ms kirby has agreed to remain employed with us through march 2011 furthermore our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train motivate and manage our associates and to attract motivate and retain additional qualified managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates competition for this type of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 

we intend to continue to open new stores which could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis during fiscal 2007 we opened 53 new stores we intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable future and 

  believe we have the longterm potential to grow our store base to over 1000 stores in the united states over the next 10 years during fiscal 2007 the average investment required to open a typical new store was approximately 15 million this continued expansion could place increased demands on our financial managerial operational and administrative resources for example our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance and slow our growth 

the capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur costs to expand this infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have historically operated a single distribution facility which houses the distribution operations for ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our ecommerce business we recently began operating a second distribution facility in phoenix arizona we are receiving vendor product at the new facility and expect to begin shipping to our phoenix arizona stores beginning in late april 2008 in order to support our recent and expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business additional distribution centers may need to be added in the future our failure to expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any significant interruption in the operations of our two distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have historically operated from a single distribution facility and recently began operating a second distribution facility we distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with directtostore arrangements from vendors or wholesalers we are a retailer carrying approximately 21000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure any significant interruption in the operation of our distribution infrastructure such as disruptions in our information systems disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping problems could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations 

we are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our ecommerce business we have identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth as part of this planned expansion of our information systems we expect to construct a new data center and modify our warehouse management system software to support our second distribution facility any interruption during the transition of our information systems to the new data center and the modification of our warehouse management system software could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the failure of our information systems to perform as designed including the failure of our warehouse management software system to operate as expected during the holiday season or to support our second distribution facility could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations shipment of goods ability to process financial information and credit card transactions and our ability to receive and process ecommerce orders or engage in normal business activities moreover security breaches or leaks of proprietary information including leaks of customers’ private data could result in liability decrease customer confidence in our company and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ecommerce operations while relatively small are increasingly important to our business we launched a new version of our ultacom website and ecommerce platform in november 2007 the relaunch of our ultacom website and ecommerce platform is important to our marketing efforts because the new ultacom website serves as a more effective extension of ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies beyond catalogs newspaper inserts and national advertising by better exposing potential new customers to the ulta brand product offerings and enhanced content as the importance of our website and ecommerce operations to our business grows we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce ecommerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation 

  a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as prestige beauty products and premium salon services which could delay our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer a broad selection of prestige beauty products at higher price points than mass beauty products we also offer a wide selection of premium salon services a downturn in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items such as prestige beauty products and premium salon services factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions levels of employment interest rates and tax rates the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions in the event of an economic downturn consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales which could force us to delay or slow our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

increased costs or interruption in our thirdparty vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production shipment or receipt of some of our merchandise which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs 

we directly source the majority of our giftwithpurchase and other promotional products through thirdparty vendors using foreign factories in addition many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries including the imposition of additional import restrictions unanticipated political changes increased customs duties legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products and natural disasters could materially harm our operations we have no longterm supply contracts with respect to such foreignsourced items many of which are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the united states from such countries our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad such as political instability disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide to the extent these acts affect the production shipment or receipt of merchandise our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors which are beyond our control and these factors could materially hurt our business financial condition and results of operations or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs 

recent volatility in the global oil markets has resulted in rising fuel and freight prices which many shipping companies are passing on to their customers our shipping costs have increased and these costs may continue to increase we may be unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers which will reduce our profitability additionally recent increased demand for shipping capacity between the united states and asia will further increase our costs for merchandise sourced from asia which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a reduction in traffic to or the closing of the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a result of our real estate strategy most of our stores are located in offmall shopping areas known as power centers or lifestyle centers which also accommodate other wellknown destination retailers power centers typically contain three to five bigbox anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants while lifestyle centers typically contain a variety of highend destination retailers but no large anchor stores as a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas our sales are derived in part from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in the lifestyle centers and power centers where our stores are located customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional economic downturn a general downturn in the local area where our store is located or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center or lifestyle center such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which would further decrease our gross profits and net income 

diversion of exclusive salon products or a decision by manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  the retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized professional retail outlets however incidents of product diversion occur which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores grocery stores or mass merchandisers diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products if diverted products are old tainted or damaged as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than purchasing from one of our salons additionally the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products 

we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase prestige mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms if these relationships were to be impaired or if certain vendors were unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position our business and financial performance 

we have no longterm supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors and therefore our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans we also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands which has allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 

during fiscal 2007 merchandise supplied to ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 45 of our net sales the loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors or by any of our other vendors could have an adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we regard our trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets knowhow and similar intellectual property as critical to our success our principal intellectual property rights include registered trademarks on our name “ulta” copyrights in our website content rights to our domain name wwwultacom and trade secrets and knowhow with respect to our ulta branded product formulations product sourcing sales and marketing and other aspects of our business as such we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees consultants suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks copyrights trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers 

if our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products consistent with applicable regulatory requirements we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent thirdparty vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for ulta including ulta branded products and giftwithpurchase and other promotional products our thirdparty manufacturers of ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory requirements if we or our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could be required to take costly corrective action in addition sanctions under the fdc act may include seizure of products injunctions against future shipment of products restitution and disgorgement of profits operating restrictions and criminal prosecution the fda does not have a premarket approval system for cosmetics and we believe we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the fda however the fda may in the future determine to regulate our cosmetics or the ingredients included in our cosmetics as drugs these events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our ulta products severely damage our brand 

  reputation and image in the marketplace increase the cost of our products cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores any of which could result in lost sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we as well as our vendors are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in our us markets numerous laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels can affect our business legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations if we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations we could be subject to future liabilities a prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our ulta branded products in particular failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

 

in addition the formulation manufacturing packaging labeling distribution sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies including the fda the ftc and state attorneys general in the united states if we our vendors or the manufacturers of our ulta products fail to comply with those regulations we could become subject to significant penalties or claims which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business in addition the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our ulta products resulting in significant loss of net sales our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our ulta product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising by us may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products 

as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states we are subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local jurisdictions our failure to comply with local building codes and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner could cause delays in our new store openings which could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior buildout of our stores landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas and while we strive to remain in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior buildout of our stores the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in and requirements of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes moreover our landlords have occasionally been unable due to the requirements of local zoning laws to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of our stores andor the larger shopping centers andor common areas which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store causing us in some instances to delay store openings as the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject increases we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes which increased construction costs andor delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs cause us to incur lost sales and profits and damage our public reputation 

  our ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services which may have been performed negligently could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves which would reduce our capital resources further we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment in which case our creditors could levy against our assets these events could cause negative publicity regarding our company brand or products which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

legal proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technologies promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents patent applications trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the united states and abroad these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and if successful could cause us to pay substantial damages further if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us we could be forced to stop or delay development manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit 

as a result of intellectual property infringement claims or to avoid potential claims we may choose to seek or be required to seek a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms even if we were able to obtain a license the rights may be nonexclusive which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property the inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 

in addition to infringement claims against us we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and other proceedings including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto proceedings before the uspto’s trademark trial and appeal board and opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to promotional products purchased from thirdparty vendors or our ulta branded products and technology some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us because of their substantially greater financial resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability 

the raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather supply conditions government regulations general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors as a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs as a result increases in the demand for or the price of raw materials could hurt our profitability 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings which will reduce our profitability 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings in response to any future increases in mailing costs we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions in addition we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes we are not a party to any longterm contracts for the supply of paper the cost of paper fluctuates significantly and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control future additional increases in postal rates or in paper or printing costs would reduce our profitability to the extent that we are unable to pass those increases directly to customers or offset those increases by raising selling prices or by reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions 

  our secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores 

we have a 150 million secured revolving credit facility or credit facility expandable under an accordion option to a maximum of 200 million with a term expiring may 2011 substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the eurodollar rate plus 100 up to 100 million and 125 thereafter the credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business these covenants among other things restrict our ability to grant liens on our assets incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and redeem our stock enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity these covenants could restrict our operational flexibility including our ability to open stores and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and in certain circumstances may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment 

we will need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy or continue our operations and we may be unable to raise capital when needed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we will seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth strategy based on our current growth strategy we expect it will be necessary to exercise the 50 million accordion option of our credit facility during fiscal 2008 in addition if general economic financial or political conditions in our markets change or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs if financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer 

failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses 

reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems processes and controls as well as on our personnel in addition as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting by the time our annual report for fiscal 2008 is due and thereafter which will require us to further document and make additional changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as a result we have been required to improve our financial and managerial controls reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 

we are currently subject to a consolidated securities class action lawsuit the outcome of which is uncertain 

we and certain of our current and former executive officers are defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit in federal court see item 3 “legal proceedings” for a more detailed description of these proceedings this putative class action remains in its preliminary stages and it is not yet possible to determine the ultimate outcome the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit seek substantial damages the legal and other costs associated with the defense of this action the amount of time required to be spent by management and the board of directors on this matter and the ultimate outcome of the litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including 

   

in addition public announcements by our competitors other retailers and vendors concerning among other things their performance strategy or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of other factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance including 

 

accordingly our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease in that event the price of our common stock would likely decline for more information on our quarterly results of operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

a significant amount of our total outstanding shares have been restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future the large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price the holders of a significant amount of our outstanding common stock are obligated subject to certain exceptions not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock during 

  the 180day period following the date of our prospectus filed with the securities and exchange commission on october 25 2007 after the expiration of the lockup period on or about april 21 2008 a significant amount these shares may be sold in the public market subject to prior registration or qualification for an exemption from registration including in the case of shares held by affiliates compliance with the volume restrictions of rule 144 

sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate these sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for stockholders to sell shares of our common stock 

our current principal stockholders have significant influence over us and they could delay deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree 

our principal stockholders own in the aggregate approximately 50 of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions and will have significant control over our management and policies such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders in addition the significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with controlling stockholders 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents stockholder rights agreement and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our stockholders which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions include 

 

as permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have a stockholder rights agreement sometimes known as a “poison pill” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock in the event of a takeover attempt this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake 

we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that in general prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15 stockholder subject to specified exceptions together these provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights agreement and of delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend 

securities litigation — in december 2007 and january 2008 three putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our current and thencurrent executive officers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois each suit alleges that the prospectus and registration statement filed pursuant to the company’s initial public offering contained materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material facts each suit claims violations of sections 11 12a2 andor 15 of the securities act of 1933 and the two later filed suits added claims under sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as well as the associated rule 10b5 in february 2008 two of the plaintiffs filed competing motions to consolidate the actions and appoint lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs’ counsel on march 18 2008 after one of the plaintiffs withdrew his motion the suits were consolidated and plaintiffs in the mirsky v ulta action were appointed lead plaintiffs lead plaintiffs have until may 19 2008 to file an amended consolidated class action complaint 

although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the consolidated class action and intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously an adverse resolution may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to the lawsuit 

  general litigation — we are also involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business including but not limited to employment related claims in the opinion of management the amount of any liability with respect to these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will not be material

overview 

we were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige mass and salon products were sold through separate distribution channels in 1999 we embarked on a multiyear strategy to understand and embrace what women want in a beauty retailer and transform ulta into the shopping experience that it is today we pioneered what we believe to be our unique combination of beauty superstore and specialty store attributes we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance 

we are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides onestop shopping for prestige mass and salon products and salon services in the united states we combine the unique elements of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer key aspects of our beauty superstore strategy include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of over 21000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics fragrance haircare skincare bath and body products and salon styling tools as well as salon haircare products we focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories our stores are conveniently located in hightraffic primarily offmall locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers as of february 2 2008 we operated 249 stores across 31 states in addition to these fundamental elements of a beauty superstore we strive to offer an uplifting shopping experience through what we refer to as “the four e’s” escape education entertainment and esthetics 

the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our growth strategy including growing our store base expanding our prestige brand offerings driving incremental salon traffic expanding our online business and continuing to enhance our brand awareness we believe that the steadily expanding us beauty products and services industry the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores coupled with ulta’s competitive strengths positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy 

comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry we do not expect our future comparable store sales increases to reflect the levels experienced in prior periods this is due in part to the difficulty in improving on such significant increases in subsequent periods 

the company adopted a structured stock option compensation program in july 2007 the award of stock options under this program will result in increased stockbased compensation expense in future periods as compared to the expense reflected in our historical financial statements 

over the longterm our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to be relatively consistent with historical rates given our planned 

  distribution infrastructure investments and the impact of the rate of new store growth we plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and decreasing our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales 

on october 30 2007 we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 7666667 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 1236 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses selling stockholders sold 2153928 additional shares of common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders we used the net proceeds from the offering to pay 930 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock which satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends 48 million to redeem our series iii preferred stock and 258 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes also in connection with the offering we converted preferred shares into 41524002 common shares and restated the par value of our common stock to 001 per share 

basis of presentation 

net sales include store and ecommerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue salon service revenue represents less than 10 of our combined product sales and services revenues and therefore these revenues are combined with product sales we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale pos in our retail stores and the time of shipment in the case of internet sales merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales 

comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation therefore a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period noncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales as a result data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 

comparable store sales is a critical measure that allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results 

 

cost of sales includes 

 

   

our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores we also expect that cost of sales as a percentage of net sales will be negatively impacted in the next several years as a result of accelerated depreciation related to our store remodel program the program was adopted in third quarter fiscal 2006 we have accelerated depreciation expense on assets to be disposed of during the remodel process such that those assets will be fully depreciated at the time of the planned remodel changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales 

this presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales 

selling general and administrative expenses include 

 

this presentation of items in selling general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling general and administrative expenses 

preopening expense includes noncapital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new and remodeled stores including store setup labor management and employee training and grand opening advertising preopening expenses also includes rent during the construction period related to new stores 

interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facility which is structured as an asset based lending instrument our interest expense will fluctuate based on the seasonal borrowing requirements associated with acquiring inventory in advance of key holiday selling periods and fluctuation in the variable interest rates we are charged on outstanding balances our credit facility is used to fund seasonal inventory needs and new and remodel store capital requirements in excess of our cash flow from operations our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates 

income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores 

  results of operations 

our fiscal years are the 52 or 53 week periods ending on the saturday closest to january 31 the company’s fiscal years ended february 2 2008 february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 were 52 53 and 52 week years respectively and are hereafter referred to as fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005

net sales 

net sales increased 1570 million or 208 to 9121 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 7551 million in fiscal 2006 fiscal 2006 was a 53week operating year and the 53rd week represented approximately 164 million in net sales adjusted for the 53rd week fiscal 2007 net sales increased 1734 million or 235 compared to fiscal 2006 this increase is due to the opening of 53 new stores in 2007 and a 64 increase in comparable store sales noncomparable stores which include stores opened in fiscal 2007 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2006 which have not yet turned comparable contributed 1279 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed 455 million of the total net sales increase our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2007 was driven by a balance in growth of customer traffic and average transaction value we attribute these results to the continued effectiveness of our marketing strategy particularly in a difficult holiday season and doubledigit growth in our prestige cosmetics category consistent with our growth strategy 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 484 million or 206 to 2836 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 2352 million in fiscal 2006 gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 311 in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 gross profit in fiscal 2007 was impacted by

interest expense 

interest expense increased 12 million or 371 to 45 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 33 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to a 270 million increase in the average debt outstanding on our variable rate credit facility during fiscal 2007 

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 168 million in fiscal 2007 represents an effective tax rate of 399 compared to fiscal 2006 tax expense of 142 million which represents an effective tax rate of 387 the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an adjustment in fiscal 2006 to reflect the benefit of state tax effects of our net operating loss carry forwards 

net income 

net income increased 28 million or 124 to 253 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 225 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in net income of 28 million resulted from an increase in gross profit of 484 million driven by a comparable store sales increase of 64 the increase in gross profit was partially offset by a 372 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses and a 47 million increase in preopening expenses 

  fiscal year 2006 versus fiscal year 2005 

net sales 

net sales increased 1760 million or 304 to 7551 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 5791 million in fiscal 2005 fiscal 2006 was a 53week operating year and the 53rd week represented approximately 164 million in net sales adjusted for the 53rd week fiscal 2006 net sales increased 1596 million or 276 compared to fiscal 2005 this increase is due to the opening of 31 new stores in 2006 two store closures and a 145 increase in comparable store sales noncomparable stores which include stores opened in fiscal 2006 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2005 which have not yet turned comparable contributed 773 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed 823 million of the total net sales increase our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2006 was driven by strong performance of existing and new brands we introduced several new fragrance brands in the first half of the year which resulted in increased customer traffic and growth in average transaction value

preopening expenses increased 24 million or 506 to 71 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 47 million in fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2006 we opened 31 new stores and remodeled 7 stores during fiscal 2005 we opened 25 new stores and remodeled 1 store 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 03 million or 123 to 33 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 30 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase in the interest rates on our variable rate credit facility 

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 142 million in fiscal 2006 represents an effective tax rate of 387 compared to fiscal 2005 tax expense of 105 million which represents an effective tax rate of 397 the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an adjustment to reflect the state tax effects of our net operating loss carry forwards 

net income 

net income increased 65 million or 412 to 225 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 160 million in fiscal 2005 the aftertax impact of the nonrecurring stock compensation charge was approximately 17 million the increase in net income of 65 million 

  resulted from an increase in gross profit of 609 million driven by a comparable store sales increase of 145 and a 100 basis point increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales the increase in gross profit was partially offset by a 479 million including the 28 million nonrecurring stock compensation charge increase in selling general and administrative expenses related to operating costs for new stores opened in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 as well as costs incurred to support the infrastructure necessary to manage current and future store growth 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled stores increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion expansion of our headquarters a new second distribution facility and for continued improvement in our information technology systems 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations changes in working capital and borrowings under our credit facility the most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors 

our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory buildup during this period for the approaching holiday season this is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and have not yet collected landlord allowances due us as part of our lease agreements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility with the accordion option exercised will satisfy the company’s working capital needs capital expenditure needs commitments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months 

merchandise inventories were 1761 million at february 2 2008 an increase of 469 million compared to the prior year end approximately 409 million of the increase resulted from the addition of 53 new stores opened since the end of fiscal 2006 the remaining increase is related to inventory for 14 new stores that will open in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 average inventory per store increased approximately 36 compared to fiscal 2006 

on october 30 2007 we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 7666667 shares of common stock to the public at a price of 1800 per share resulting in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock of 1380 million selling stockholders sold 2153928 additional shares of common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders the aggregate net proceeds to us were 1236 million after deducting 97 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and 47 million in offering expenses we used the net proceeds from the offering to pay 930 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock which satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends 48 million to redeem our series iii preferred stock and 258 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes also in connection with the offering we converted preferred shares into 41524002 common shares and restated the par value of our common stock to 001 per share 

credit facility 

our credit facility is with lasalle bank national association as the administrative agent wachovia capital finance corporation as collateral agent and jp morgan chase bank as documentation agent this facility provides maximum credit of 150 million and a 50 million accordion option through may 31 2011 the credit facility agreement contains a restrictive financial covenant on tangible net worth substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the eurodollar rate plus 100 up to 100 million and 125 thereafter the advance rates on owned inventory are 80 85 from september 1 to january 31 

the interest rate on the outstanding balances under the facility as of february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 was 4812 and 7025 respectively we had approximately 731 million and 489 million of availability as of february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 respectively excluding the accordion option we also have an ongoing letter of credit that renews annually which had a balance of 03 million as of february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 

  operating activities 

operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation realized losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes 

 

the decrease in net cash from operating activities of 87 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily attributed to the following 

 

the increase in net cash from operating activities of 180 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is primarily attributed to the following 

 

  investing activities 

investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems 

 

during fiscal 2006 our chief executive officer exercised stock options in exchange for a promissory note for 41 million the company withheld 24 million of payrollrelated taxes in connection with the exercised options and that portion of the note has been classified as an investing activity the remainder of the promissory note of 17 million related to exercise proceeds of the options and was classified as a noncash financing activity the note was paid in full on june 29 2007 all of the related party notes receivable were settled during fiscal 2007 

financing activities 

financing activities consist principally of draws and payments on our credit facility and capital stock transactions 

 

the increase in net cash provided by financing activities of 407 million in fiscal 2007 is primarily the result of net proceeds of 1236 million obtained in our initial public offering to pay 930 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock 48 million to redeem our series iii preferred stocks and 258 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes in addition the net increase of 187 million in longterm borrowings was attributable to the increase in merchandise inventories and new store capital expenditures as a result of the increase in new store openings 

the increase in net cash provided by financing activities of 61 million in fiscal 2006 is due to the 51 million increase in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 08 million increase in proceeds recognized by the company resulting from the exercise of stock options by employees net of a 22 million outflow related to a treasury stock transaction with an investor 

  seasonality 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season to a lesser extent our business is also affected by mothers’ day as well as the “back to school” season and valentines’ day any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results for the entire fiscal year our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future as such we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs in addition inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations and letters of credit we do not have any noncancelable purchase commitments as of february 2 2008 our letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility were 03 million as of february 2 2008 

contractual obligations 

we lease retail stores warehouses corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2019 our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases in addition to future minimum lease payments most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straightline over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable for certain locations we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent which is amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable while a number of our store leases include contingent rentals contingent rent amounts are insignificant 

the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent common area maintenance insurance and real estate taxes the table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of february 2 2008 

 

 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principals gaap the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities 

  revenues and expenses management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates a discussion of our more significant estimates follows management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventory valuation 

merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value cost is determined using the weightedaverage cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including coop advertising markdowns and volume discounts we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand age of inventory and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations we record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health workers’ compensation and general liability insurance we maintain stop loss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our liability exposure current stop loss coverage is 150000 for health claims 100000 for general liability claims and 250000 for workers’ compensation claims management estimates undiscounted loss reserves associated with these liabilities in part by considering historical claims experience industry factors and other actuarial assumptions including information provided by third parties selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 were 24 million 23 million and 21 million respectively adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of these reserves have been insignificant for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

impairment of longlived tangible assets 

we review longlived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified which is the store level significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets we have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

effective january 29 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment  pursuant to sfas no 123r sharebased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest as a nonpublic entity that previously used the minimum value method for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 123 we were required to adopt the prospective method of accounting under sfas no 123r under this transitional method we are required to record compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income for all awards granted after the adoption date and to awards modified repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date using the fair value provisions of sfas no 123r 

prior to january 29 2006 we accounted for sharebased awards using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  under the provisions of apb opinion no 25 no compensation expense was recognized when stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than market value at the grant date 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the expected volatility is based on volatilities of a peer group of publiclytraded companies the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect 

  on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option the expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding we have elected to use the shortcut approach in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 107 sharebased payment to develop the expected life we recognize compensation cost related to the stock options on a straightline method over the requisite service period 

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements “sharebased awards” for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 for financial assets and liabilities and recurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities the fasb has provided a one year deferral for all nonfinancial and nonrecurring assets and liabilities we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 157 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 159 permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value on specified election dates the associated unrealized gains and losses on the items for which the fair value option has been elected shall be reported in earnings sfas no 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 159 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in december 2007 the securities and exchange commission sec issued sab no 110 simplified method for plain vanilla share options  sab no 110 amends the views of the sec staff regarding the use of a “simplified” method as discussed in sab no 107 in developing an estimate of expected term of “plain vanilla” share options in accordance with sfas no 123r in particular the staff indicated in sab no 107 that it will accept a company’s election to use the “simplified” method for share option grants prior to december 31 2007 sab no 110 allows public companies which do not have historically sufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate to continue to use the “simplified” method for estimating the expected term of “plain vanilla” share option grants after december 31 2007 we will continue to use the “simplified” method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term in accordance with sab no 110 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowing under our credit facility interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates we have an interest rate swap agreement in place with a notional amount of 250 million which effectively converts variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at an interest rate of 511 the interest rate swap reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 had a negative fair value of 12 million included in accrued liabilities and a positive fair value of 32000 included in other assets respectively the interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of which is recorded as an unrecognized gain loss in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity our weighted average debt for fiscal 2007 was 569 million adjusted for the 250 million hedged amount a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a 06 million change to our interest expense for fiscal 2007
