research and development 



technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs additionally we operate laboratories in close geographic proximity to our customers and we customize our products for our customers enduse applications our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management we have obtained government funding for a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate 

we own and operate several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes in addition to the company’s centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 “properties” of this form 10k operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate global competitive sourcing laboratories because of our broad array of products and customers we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

raw materials energy and logistics 

ppg uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses and sand and soda ash in the specialty coatings and materials business raw materials include both organic primarily petroleumderived materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide these raw materials represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible our raw materials include biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy while prices for certain raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand changes such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil natural gas and other key feedstocks 

through effective management of raw materials energy and logistics the company maintains a competitive cost position and ensures ongoing security of supply security of a sufficient supply of highquality raw materials is important to ppg’s continued success as it allows the company to increase production as necessary to keep pace with customer demand in 2021 we experienced shortages of certain raw materials which negatively impacted our ability to fully meet customer demand we are continuing our aggressive sourcing initiatives to improve our competitive cost position and broaden our supply of highquality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple sources of supply within asia and other lower cost regions of the world continuing to diversify our resin supply including actions to expand our onsite resin manufacturing capabilities and reducing the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the regulation and registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the european union and many countries including china canada the united states “us” the united kingdom “uk” brazil mexico and south korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

at ppg our commitment to sustainability extends to our suppliers as an extension of our internal focus on sustainability our global supplier code of conduct clarifies our global expectations in the areas of business integrity labor practices associate health and safety and environmental management our supplier sustainability policy builds upon our global supplier code of conduct by establishing expectations for sustainability within our supply chain this policy reinforces our expectations that our suppliers as well as their subcontractors will comply fully with applicable laws and adhere to internationally recognized environmental social and corporategovernance standards

in 2020 ppg engaged ecovadis™ a leading global corporate social responsibility and sustainability ratings company to leverage assessment processes tools resources and insights to drive sustainability standards and practices throughout ppgs global supply base the ecovadis sustainability intelligence suite assists ppg in providing broadscale supply chain risk screening and mapping more reliable supplier sustainability metric scorecards with actionable ratings and complete audit and improvement management capabilities in 2021 ppg earned a gold rating from ecovadis underscoring our ongoing commitment to corporate social responsibility csr and our efforts to manage our economic social and environmental impact 

we typically experience fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates government regulation and global supply and demand factors for 2021 versus 2020 we experienced increases in our operating costs of more than 10 billion led by raw material cost inflation the increases in raw material costs were primarily driven by ongoing supply constraints including various force majeure declarations higher energy prices maintenance outages at many of our suppliers energy surcharges in europe labor availability challenges transportation shortages and higher ocean freight costs also in 2021 we experienced increases in other logistics costs driven by supply chain disruptions logistical challenges labor shortages and manufacturing interruptions at both our factories and those of our suppliers and customers based on the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are significant 

given the uncertainty presented by covid’s impact on supply chains globally and the global economic recovery we are not able to predict the 2022 fullyear impact of changes in raw material pricing versus 2021 however we expect the negative impact of raw material inflation to lessen as 2022 progresses 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance to us of economic impacts occurring in any one region of the world as a result of our global footprint we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets trade protection measures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2021 favorable foreign currency translation increased net sales by approximately 345 million and income before income taxes by approximately 60 million 

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st are summarized below 



refer to note 19 “revenue recognition” in item 8 of this form 10k for additional geographic information pertaining to sales and note 20 “reportable business segment information” in item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppg’s property plant and equipment 

seasonality 

ppg’s income before income taxes has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in our architectural coatings and traffic solutions businesses demand for our architectural coatings and traffic solutions products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the us canada and europe the latin america paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter these cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher cash from operating activities 

employee relations 

the average number of people employed by ppg during 2021 was approximately 49300 of which approximately 14800 were in the united states and approximately 34500 were elsewhere in the world the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2021 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our results of operations overall we believe we have good relationships with our employees

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning current and 

  2021 ppg annual report and 10k 8 

former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including certain sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

our experience to date regarding environmental matters leads us to believe that we will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 282 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 100 million to 200 million these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites none of which are individually significant the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 



it is expected that capital expenditures for such projects in 2022 will be in the range of 20 million to 30 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it is likely that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized refer to note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of paints coatings and specialty materials we operate in a business environment that includes risks each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

economic risks 

the effects of covid19 have negatively impacted and are continuing to adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the effects of the public health crisis caused by covid19 have interfered with the ability of ppg our suppliers customers and others to conduct business and have negatively affected consumer confidence and the global economy public health officials have recommended or mandated certain precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including prohibitions on congregating in groups shelterinplace orders vaccination requirements or similar measures preventative and protective actions that public health officials governments or ppg have taken with respect to covid19 have and will continue to adversely impact our business suppliers distribution channels and customers including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time reduced operations reduced workforce availability reduced ability to supply products or reduced demand for our products our financial condition liquidity and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by these preventative actions and the disruption to our 

2021 ppg annual report and form 10k 9 

business and that of our suppliers and customers as we cannot predict the duration or scope of covid19 the negative financial impact to our business cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials raw materials include both organic primarily petroleumderived materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide these raw materials represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

while not our customary practice we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins may be lower 

most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply within asia and other lower cost regions of the world diversification of our resin supply including adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations our raw materials include biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy despite our actions undertaken to maintain supply arrangements adequate to meet planned operating requirements raw material supply chain disruptions including logistical and transportation challenges in many regions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our financial results 

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future recently global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors including covid19 consumer sentiment and commodity market volatility disruption in supply chains globally potential changes to international trade agreements the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs and labor shortages in certain regions of the world ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against major currencies could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in us dollars 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose customers or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products additionally our ability to increase prices may impact the overall economics for the products we offer competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  2021 ppg annual report and 10k 10 

legal regulatory and tax risks 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances in addition various laws regulate health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including those described in note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” in item 8 of this form 10k will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations as well as interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs 

for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

further although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees agents business partners or businesses that we acquire any noncompliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory costs 

changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to various taxes in both the us and nonus jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation further ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it becomes available recent developments including potential us or international tax reform the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities if our effective income tax rate was to increase our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax 

2021 ppg annual report and form 10k 11 

provisions and accruals if future audits find that additional taxes are due we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations 

operational and strategic risks 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our operations outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2021 by products sold outside the us was approximately 65 

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events significant public health issues computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce our ability to supply products reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

part of the company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions over the last decade we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 

• difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business 

• delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products 

• diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns 

• difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter 

• unforeseen claims and liabilities including unexpected environmental exposures product liability or existing cyber vulnerability 

• unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business 

• difficulty in conforming the acquired business’ standards processes procedures and controls to those of our operations and 

• difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses 

these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures or such anticipated benefits may never be realized which could adversely affect our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve our business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs 

we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and selfdriving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future potentially lowering demand for our automotive refinish coatings in addition through the introduction of new technologies new business models or new methods of travel such as 

  2021 ppg annual report and 10k 12 

ridesharing the number of automotive oem newbuilds may decline potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings and related automotive parts 

additionally the development of customerfacing digital platforms has and will continue to transform certain retail industries an inability to develop such solutions and our customer’s pace of adoption of those solutions could negatively affect our business or the market demand for our products 

our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate 

increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches this could lead to negative publicity theft or other financial loss modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information manufacture of defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

in 2018 we concluded that previously issued financial statements as detailed below should not be relied upon and restated those previously issued financial statements which led to among other things shareholder litigation investigations by the sec and the us attorney’s office a settlement by the company with the sec and unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees and which may result in certain other risks 

as discussed in the explanatory note note 2 “restatement of previously reported consolidated annual financial statements” and in note 19 “quarterly financial information unaudited” in item 8 of the 2017 form 10ka in 2018 we concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of december 31 2017 and 2016 and for each of the quarterly and yeartodate periods in 2017 and the final quarterly and yeartodate period in 2016 should no longer be relied upon the determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that these financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements although the company restated these financial statements remediated the material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting reached a settlement with the sec and is no longer the subject of an investigation by the us attorney’s office we continue to be subject to risks and uncertainties relating to these events including advancement of legal expenses and potential indemnification obligations to certain current and former employees who are responding to investigations by the sec and us attorney’s office for alleged violations of the securities laws relating to the restatement described above potential loss of investor confidence potential reputational harm and a potential negative impact on our stock price

effective tax rate and earnings per diluted share continuing operations 



the effective tax rate for the yearended december 31 2021 was 206 a decrease of 08 from the prior year primarily driven by a benefit from releases of reserves for uncertain tax positions 

earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2021 increased yearoveryear driven by increased net sales in 2021 due to acquisitionrelated sales higher sales volumes and higher selling prices the impact of higher net sales on earnings was partially offset by higher raw material costs due to ongoing supply constraints and higher transportation costs driven by supply chain disruptions related to covid19 refer to the regulation g reconciliations  results from operations for additional information 

regulation g reconciliations  results from operations 

ppg believes investors’ understanding of the company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income from continuing operations earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ppg’s effective tax rate and segment income adjusted for certain items ppg’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations net income from continuing operations earnings per diluted share from continuing operations the effective tax rate and segment income adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and should not be considered a substitute for net income from continuing operations earnings per diluted share from continuing operations the effective tax rate segment income or other financial measures as computed in accordance with us gaap in addition adjusted net income adjusted earnings per diluted share and the adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies

architectural coatings – americas and asia pacific net sales increased a midsingledigit percentage during the year with differences by channel and region despite a strong first quarter the remaining nine months of the year were negatively impacted by raw material shortages favorable foreign currency benefited net sales due to the strengthening of the mexican peso and certain currencies in the asia pacific region in mexico ppg comex architectural coatings business net sales excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions organic sales increased by about 10 compared to the prior year as the concessionaire network sellout of ppg products continued to be strong 

architectural coatings – emea net sales increased about 25 versus prior year largely driven by acquisitionrelated sales from tikkurila and higher selling prices favorable foreign currency translation benefited net sales compared to the prior year sales volumes were strong in the first half of the year but were negatively impacted by raw material shortages in the second half 

net sales for automotive refinish coatings increased over 20 with significant growth in each region versus prior year driven by an increase in global miles driven and traffic density in most of the world coupled with higher selling prices 

aerospace coatings net sales increased a lowsingledigit percentage during the year primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation sales volumes were flat compared to prior year as a modest increase in demand for the company’s military applications was offset by a decline in commercial oem 

net sales in the protective and marine coatings business increased over 35 versus prior year due to higher selling prices strong demand in the asia pacific region and acquisitionrelated sales from versaflex 

segment income increased 132 million yearoveryear due to higher selling prices higher sales volumes acquisitionrelated earnings and savings from previously approved restructuring actions partially offset by raw material and logistics cost inflation 

looking ahead first quarter 2022 

in the performance coatings reportable business segment supply chain and manufacturing disruptions are expected to continue as the first quarter 2022 progresses the supply of several key inputs remains tight which will continue to constrain sales further selling price increases have been secured or are being initiated during the quarter for all businesses the company will continue to execute against various costsavings initiatives aggregate sales volumes in the first quarter are anticipated to be lower by a midsingledigit percentage compared to the first quarter 2021 which still exhibited elevated architectural doityourself “diy” demand in many regions first quarter 2022 acquisitionrelated sales are estimated to be between 150 million and 170 million from tikkurila and versaflex historically tikkurila sales improve sequentially in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter as it supports building inventory in its distribution channel

industrial coatings 



industrial coatings segment net sales increased due to the following 

● higher sales volumes 9 

● acquisitionrelated sales 5 

● higher selling prices 5 

● favorable foreign currency translation 2 

in 2021 the acquisitions of wörwag tikkurila and cetelon increased net sales in the industrial coatings segment versus prior year 

automotive oem coatings sales volumes increased by a midsingledigit percentage yearoveryear with declines in the second half of the year during the year industrywide production disruptions worsened at many automotive oem customers due to semiconductor chip shortages in the us automotive oem dealer inventories remained at historically low levels as consumer demand remained very robust while production levels were constrained 

for the industrial coatings business organic sales increased by a highteenpercentage yearoveryear as global industrial production continued to improve in most regions selling prices and sales volumes were higher in all regions versus prior year and growth was led by the appliance and heavyduty equipment subsegments 

packaging coatings organic sales increased by a midteenpercentage yearoveryear due to higher selling prices and sales volume growth including strong growth across the canned beverage segment partially offset by softening demand for the canned food segment compared to elevated levels in the prior year 

specialty coatings and materials net sales increased by about 35 versus the prior year driven by higher sales volumes in the us and europe 

segment income decreased 70 million yearoveryear due to raw material cost inflation partially offset by higher selling prices higher sales volumes and savings from previously approved restructuring actions 

looking ahead first quarter 2022 

aggregate sales volumes for the industrial coatings reportable business segment for the first quarter 2022 are expected to be lower by a midsingledigit percentage compared to the prioryear first quarter due to ongoing impacts from customer supply disruptions and coatings raw material shortages along with continuing covidrelated operational challenges many of these factors are also expected to lead to additional raw material cost inflation in the first quarter sequentially versus the fourth quarter the company continues to prioritize working with customers to secure further selling price increases in all businesses segment margins are expected to begin improving on a sequential basis in the first half 2022 the company will also continue to aggressively manage costs which will include executing against various costsavings initiatives the acquisitions of wörwag and cetelon are expected to deliver sales of about 100 million in the first quarter with margins below the segment’s average 

review and outlook 

during 2021 supply disruptions severe cost inflation and continuing impacts from covid19 significantly impacted net sales and earnings and the company’s ability to meet robust aggregate customer demand there was partial recovery in enduse markets that were significantly impacted by mobility restrictions in 2020 such as automotive refinish coatings and aerospace coatings but both remained below 2019 global demand levels demand for architectural products was mixed as diy gradually moderated to prepandemic levels this was partially offset by strong recovery in doitforme “difm” activity as professional paint contractor project work improved from lower levels in 2020 supported by a strong us housing market a significant shortage of semiconductor chips developed as the year progressed which constrained automotive oem manufacturers’ production despite strong underlying demand in many regions raw material cost inflation trended higher throughout the year finishing the fourth quarter about 30 above the prior year fourth quarter some other key costs continued to increase in 2021 such as logistics employee wage and benefit costs the company took swift action to collaborate with its customers and increase selling prices to help mitigate the elevated input costs which drove a 5 increase in selling prices compared to 2020 ppg’s net sales excluding foreign currency translation impact increased approximately 19 versus the prior year and were a record 168 billion organic sales were up by about 10 and acquisitionrelated sales contributed 9 to net sales growth compared to prior year the company

us and canada 

in 2021 economic activity rebounded sharply from depressed levels experienced due to pandemic related restrictions in 2020 for the full year us gdp and industrial production both increased by nearly 6 demand in the residential and commercial construction markets also significantly improved during 2021 new home starts advanced by a lowteen percentage in 2021 versus approximately 8 in 2020 residential remodeling was up by about 9 in 2021 versus 2020 supported by strong housing fundamentals commercial construction was down approximately 10 compared to 2020 market demand for architectural paint shifted significantly back to difm from the diy channel during the year as lower us unemployment and increased mobility resulted in consumers choosing to hire professional paint contractors architectural coatings sales volumes in the us and canada were negatively impacted by severe raw material shortages that prevented the company from meeting the demand for its architectural products despite strong demand for automotive oem products the semiconductor chip shortage constrained production automotive oem industry builds were similar to 2020 and remain about 20 below 2019 production levels the aerospace coatings business began what is expected to be a multiyear recovery to regain 2019 activity levels before the pandemic the company’s sales mix was approximately 70 commercial and 30 military during the pandemic and through 2021 sales volumes for military applications remained solid in part due to specification of ppg products with advantaged technology the commercial segment remains down about 40 due to lower passenger miles flown and significantly fewer international flights the commercial aftermarket segment did show a strong recovery in the second half of 2021 as domestic flight activity improved throughout the world the automotive refinish coatings business also experienced gradual improvement through the year as miles driven and collision claims trended toward prepandemic levels packaging coatings was favorably impacted by new business wins at a number of new packaged beverage can factories and overall solid demand for the company’s sustainable products higher acquisitionrelated sales were mostly related to the ennisflint acquisition which is now the traffic solutions business overall sales volumes in the region were higher by a midsingledigit percentage compared to the prior year solid yearover year increases in automotive refinish industrial automotive oem and packaging coatings businesses were partially offset by lower yearoveryear sales volumes in architectural and aerospace coatings aggregate regional sales volumes remain about 10 lower than the fourth quarter 2019 the us and canada remained ppg’s largest region representing approximately 40 of 2021 net sales 

europe middle east and africa 

european economic activity improved in 2021 but was constrained by supply disruptions industrial production and manufacturing rates in the region were higher than 2020 activity in this region was negatively impacted by mobility restrictions associated with covid19 and by the uk’s exit from the european union which further disrupted logistics especially to and from the uk semiconductor chip shortages negatively impacted automotive oem sales volumes versus prior year despite strong demand architectural coatings – emea net sales were higher driven by strong demand by professional paint contractors and the june 2021 acquisition of tikkurila partially offset by lower demand for architectural diy products from elevated levels in 2020 net sales were aided by partial recovery in the aerospace and automotive refinish coatings businesses demand for packaging coatings and general industrial products was solid 

emea represented approximately 32 of ppg’s 2021 net sales modestly higher than 2020 net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation increased over 20 led by higher selling prices and acquisitionrelated sales regional sales volumes were up a midsingledigit percentage compared to 2020 but remain 8 below 2019 

asia pacific and latin america 

the emerging regions of asia pacific and latin america represented 28 of ppg’s 2021 net sales in aggregate similar to the prior year 

asia pacific remained the largest emerging region with net sales of nearly 3 billion led by china which remained ppg’s second largest country by revenue net sales in 2021 were more than 20 higher than 2020 driven by strong organic growth that was up a midteenpercentage compared to 2020 the sales volume growth was led by recovering demand for coatings products from softer economic activity in 2020 and demand for the company’s technologically advantaged products sales volumes were the strongest in the protective and marine industrial and packaging coatings businesses sales volumes in the automotive oem enduse market were positive and above industry build rates but were constrained by semiconductor chip shortages sales volumes in the region were slightly higher compared to 2019 

overall demand in latin america sharply increased yearoveryear driven by improved economic activity in most enduse markets organic sales were higher by a highteenpercentage as compared to 2020 strong contributions were made by the ppg comex business which continued to outpace the industry and added over 150 new concessionaire locations during 2021 additionally all the businesses in the industrial coatings reportable segment delivered strong year over year sales growth foreign currency translation finished about 3 favorable compared to 2020 principally driven by a weaker 

  2021 ppg annual report and 10k 22 

us dollar compared to currencies including the mexican peso and brazilian real sales volumes in the region were up a lowsingledigit percentage compared to 2019 

outlook 

we expect solid global market growth in 2022 that will likely be uneven by region and enduse as 2022 progresses we expect demand for coatings products to benefit from more economic reopening an easing of supply chain problems general inventory rebuilding across many enduse markets and healthy consumer spending continued recovery is expected in the automotive refinish automotive oem and aerospace coatings businesses which collectively accounted for about 40 of the company’s prepandemic sales and where the company has broad global businesses supported by advantaged technologies 

the heightened supply and covidrelated disruptions experienced in the fourth quarter 2021 are expected to continue into the first quarter of 2022 impacting the company’s ability to manufacture and deliver product we anticipate more favorable economic conditions in the second quarter 

we anticipate that ppg’s us and canada regional growth will be led by aerospace and automotive oem coatings as both enduse markets continue their recovery to prepandemic demand levels automotive oem industry builds in the region are expected to be higher by a midteenpercentage compared to 2021 architectural diy demand is expected to remain at more moderate levels during 2022 and similar to 2019 traffic solutions demand should be aided later in 2022 as infrastructure activity gains momentum 

we expect industry demand trends in 2022 in europe to gradually improve from those experienced in 2021 particularly in the automotive oem and refinish coatings businesses the integration of tikkurila will continue and synergies from recent acquisitions should aid earnings growth regional growth is expected to remain mixed by subregion and country favorable enduse trends are expected to continue in packaging protective and marine and general industrial coatings overall demand is expected to be similar but mixed by country in the architectural coatings business raw material availability is expected to gradually improve as the year progresses we continue to monitor the economic environment in the uk as its exit from the european union progresses and impacts consumer sentiment logistics labor availability and coatings demand 

in asia pacific we expect economic activity to be soft in china during the first quarter as more severe operating restrictions have recently been imposed due to covid and the winter olympics the region is expected to receive stimulus support that should help aid economic activity as the year progresses economic output in southeast asia and india is still below 2019 levels but is expected to improve in 2022 in china we expect continued growth above the global average despite challenges in the real estate market and heightened risks as the chinese economy continues to rely more on domestic consumption the recovery in marine coatings newbuild demand is expected to gain momentum as order books for large vessels and container ships is at multiyear highs 

in latin america we anticipate slightly better economic conditions in mexico most of central america and south america compared to 2021 we expect continued strong demand in the ppg comex architectural coatings business 

significant other factors 

we made significant progress on the global restructuring programs that were announced in april 2018 june 2019 and june 2020 the april 2018 program has been substantially completed in the fourth quarter 2021 the company approved business restructuring plans related to recent acquisitions aggregate restructuring savings related to the 2020 2019 and 2018 programs was approximately 135 million in 2021 aggregate restructuring savings is expected to be at least 70 million in 2022 including the impact of acquisition synergies we will continue to monitor and aggressively manage the company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment 

raw materials are our most significant input cost ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates and global supply and demand factors 

in aggregate average raw material costs were significantly higher in 2021 versus 2020 the increases in raw material costs were primarily driven by ongoing supply constraints including various force majeure declarations higher energy prices maintenance outages at many of our suppliers energy surcharges in europe labor availability challenges transportation shortages and higher ocean freight costs ppg currently expects raw material costs to be between 25 and 30 higher on a yearoveryear basis in the first quarter 2022 cost inflation is expected in several other areas including wage benefit and logistics costs in 2022 

we achieved selling price improvement across all businesses in 2021 reflecting the company’s efforts to offset various inflationary pressures the company will continue to prioritize additional selling price increases in the first quarter 2022 and will seek additional increases throughout the year as necessary 

2021 ppg annual report and form 10k 23 

in 2021 we experienced favorable foreign currency translation throughout the year we expect unfavorable yearoveryear foreign currency translation in 2022 the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2022 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from this expectation the company generally purchases raw materials incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transactionrelated impacts 

the 2022 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 22 to 23 varying by quarter this range represents the company’s best estimate 

over the past five years the company used over 3 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 27 million shares of ppg stock including 210 million in 2021 the company ended the year with approximately 13 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization during 2021 the company deployed 21 billion for acquisitions 371 million for capital expenditures and 536 million for dividends in 2021 ppg marked the 50th annual per share dividend increase and the 122nd successive year of annual dividend payments 

ppg ended 2021 with approximately 11 billion in cash and shortterm investments the company expects continued strong cash generation in 2022 

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought refer to item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” in item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits 

as discussed in item 3 and note 14 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

as also discussed in note 14 ppg has significant reserves for environmental contingencies refer to the environmental matters section of note 14 for details of these reserves it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time

  2021 ppg annual report and 10k 24 

2021 vs 2020 

the 567 million decrease in cash from operating activities  continuing operations was primarily due to increases in working capital excluding the impact of business acquisitions 

operating working capital 

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 receivables from customers net of allowance for doubtful accounts 2 inventories and 3 trade liabilities refer to note 3 “working capital detail” in item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses 

a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales fourth quarter sales annualized 



environmental expenditures 



we expect cash outlays for environmental remediation activities in 2022 to be between 80 million and 100 million 

cash used for investing activities 



2021 vs 2020 

the 957 million increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions and capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a production facility in connection with the company’s manufacturing footprint consolidation plans and associated restructuring programs 

capital expenditures including business acquisitions 



1 includes modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects 

capital expenditures related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects is expected to be in the range of 475 million to 525 million in 2022 in support of future organic growth opportunities and reflecting lower capital spending in the past two years due to covid19 constraints 

in 2022 the company will continue cash deployment focused on shareholder value creation with a preference for business acquisitions coupled with debt reduction to enhance financial flexibility 

2021 ppg annual report and form 10k 25 

cash from financing activities 



2021 vs 2020 

the 152 million increase in cash from financing activities was primarily due the issuance of longterm debt in 2021 partially offset by higher repayments of longterm debt purchases of treasury stock and dividends paid yearoveryear

the company has approximately 13 billion remaining under the current authorization from the board of directors which was approved in december 2017 the current authorized repurchase program has no expiration date

debt issued and repaid 





credit agreements and lines of credit 

in february 2021 ppg entered into a 20 billion term loan credit agreement the term loan credit agreement the term loan credit agreement provided the company with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount 20 billion on an unsecured basis prior to december 31 2021 as further discussed in note 9 borrowings and lines of credit in item 8 of this form 10k in june 2021 ppg borrowed 700 million under the 20 billion term loan credit agreement in december 2021 ppg borrowed an additional 700 million under the term loan credit agreement 

in august 2019 ppg amended and restated its fiveyear credit agreement the “credit agreement” with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in note 9 borrowings and lines of credit in item 8 of this form 10k the credit agreement amends and restates the companys existing five year credit agreement dated as of december 18 2015 the credit agreement provides for a 22 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the credit agreement will terminate on august 30 2024 in march 2020 ppg borrowed 800 million under the credit agreement and repaid that amount in full in april 2020 there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 

  2021 ppg annual report and 10k 26 

the credit agreement also supports the company’s commercial paper borrowings which are classified as longterm based on ppg’s intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis as of december 31 2021 and 2020 there were 440 million and 250 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding respectively 

the term loan credit agreement and credit agreement require the company to maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization as defined in the term loan credit agreement and credit agreement of 60 or less provided that for any fiscal quarter in which the company has made an acquisition for consideration in excess of 1 billion and for the next five fiscal quarters thereafter the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization may not exceed 65 at any time as of december 31 2021 total indebtedness to total capitalization as defined under the credit agreement and the term loan was 48 

in addition to the amounts available under lines of credit the company maintains access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time which may provide an additional source of liquidity 

refer to note 9 “borrowings and lines of credit” in item 8 of this form 10k for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit and debt covenants 

cash requirements 

we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments cash from operations and the company’s access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending acquisitions dividend payments debt service share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant cash requirements the company’s significant cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and commitments 



1 interest on all outstanding debt 

2 includes interest payments 

3 the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases and electricity consistent with customary industry practice 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the cash requirements table as well as letters of credit as discussed in note 9 “borrowings and lines of credit” in item 8 of this form 10k 

other liquidity matters 

at december 31 2021 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was 175 million th e timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented in item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation to pending impending or 

2021 ppg annual report and form 10k 27 

overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” and note 12 “income taxes” in item 8 of this form 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually refer to note 13 “employee benefit plans” in item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

business combinations 

in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities 

the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich acquired intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of acquired finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test at least annually or more frequently if an indication of impairment arises the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount in the quantitative test fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include discount rates tax rates future revenues operating cash flows and capital expenditures for more information on these matters see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

comparing spot exchange rates at december 31 2021 and at december 31 2020 the us dollar strengthened against certain currencies in the countries where ppg operates driven primarily by the euro and mexican peso as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2021 decr eased by 325 million from december 31 2020 

comparing average exchange rates during 2021 to those of 2020 the us dollar weakened against currencies of the countries within the regions ppg operates this had a favorable impact of approximately 60 million on full year 2021 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars 

forwardlooking statements 

management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the sec also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of covid19 global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by our competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to 

  2021 ppg annual report and 10k 28 

achieve selling price increases the ability to recover margins customer inventory levels our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities the timing and expected benefits of our acquisitions difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in the markets we serve the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the results of governmental investigations and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 

consequently while the list of factors presented here and in item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things lower sales or income business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 10 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” in item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates could impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk certain foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2021 and 2020 served as a hedge of a portion of ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 24 million and 2 million as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectiv ely the potential reduction in ppg’s income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european and canadian currencies and 20 for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 would have been 306 million and 226 million respectively 

as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 ppg had us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with notional amounts of 775 million and 875 million respectively the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 50 million and a net liability of 8 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by 77 million and 95 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 16 billion and 24 billion respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of 178 million and 273 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs in the first quarter of 2018 ppg entered into interest rate swaps which converted 525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt the fair value of these contracts was an asset of 36 million and 67 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively an increase in variable interest rates of 10 would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest expense 1 million for the periods ended december 31 2021 and 2020 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the periods ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 56 million and 48 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income before income taxes or cash flows

research and development 



technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs additionally we operate laboratories in close geographic proximity to our customers and we customize our products for our customers enduse applications our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management we have obtained government funding for a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate 

we own and operate several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes in addition to the company’s centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 “properties” of this form 10k operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate global competitive sourcing laboratories because of our broad array of products and customers we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

raw materials energy and logistics 

the effective management of raw materials energy and logistics is important to ppg’s continued success as ppg uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses and sand and soda ash in the specialty coatings and materials business raw materials include both organic primarily petroleumderived materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide these raw materials represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible our raw materials include biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy while prices for certain raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand changes such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil natural gas and other key feedstocks 

we are continuing our aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials improve our overall competitive cost position and ensure ongoing security of supply these initiatives include qualifying multiple sources of supply both local and international including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and reducing the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the european union and many other countries including china canada the united states “us” the united kingdom “uk” brazil mexico and south korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

ppg has joined a global initiative to eliminate child labor from the mica industry and the company is continuing to take steps including audits of our suppliers to ensure compliance with ppg’s policy against the use of child labor in our supply chains 

at ppg our commitment to sustainability extends to our suppliers as an extension of our internal focus on sustainability our global supplier code of conduct clarifies our global expectations in the areas of business integrity labor practices associate health and safety and environmental management as a member of the responsible mica initiative ppg continues to be committed to establishing a fair responsible and sustainable mica supply chain in addition in 2020 ppg engaged ecovadis™ a leading global corporate social responsibility and sustainability ratings company to leverage assessment processes tools resources and insights to drive sustainability standards and practices throughout ppgs 

  2020 ppg annual report and 10k 6 

global supply base the ecovadis sustainability intelligence suite will assist ppg in providing broadscale supply chain risk screening and mapping more reliable supplier sustainability metric scorecards with actionable ratings and complete audit and improvement management capabilities 

ppg earned a gold rating from ecovadis underscoring our ongoing commitment to corporate social responsibility csr and our efforts to manage our economic social and environmental impact 

we typically experience fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates government regulation and global supply and demand factors for 2020 versus 2019 we experienced deflationary movements in the majority of our costs driven by a general slowdown in industrial demand due to the pandemic affecting the global supply and demand balances this was in addition to price and cost decreases in most of our key feedstocks through the first half of 2020 

given the uncertainty of the global economic recovery from the pandemic coupled with the continuing volatility in certain feedstock costs particularly the volatility in oil and oilbased derivatives and foreign currencies we are not able to predict with certainty the 2021 fullyear impact of changes in raw material pricing versus 2020 

further given the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are sizable as are wage and benefit changes for 2020 versus 2019 ppg experienced a modest increase in logistics costs as a percentage of sales this is due to inefficiencies in the global supply network and lower transportation agility due to restrictions associated with the global pandemic entering into 2021 transportation remains challenged with multiple supply and international trade factors after the united kingdom’s exit from the european union led to equipment shortages impacting availability through the year we see these factors waning as supply networks become stabilized with new global demand patterns and the reduced impact of covid19 through vaccination as a result of these factors offset by improved operating efficiencies ppg expects low level increases in logistics costs as a percentage of sales in 2021 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on our total net sales and income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income as a result of our global footprint we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets trade protection measures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2020 unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased net sales by approximately 150 million and income before income taxes by approximately 25 million 

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st are summarized below 



refer to note 22 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppg’s property plant and equipment and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales 

seasonality 

ppg’s income before income taxes has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in our architectural coatings and traffic solutions businesses demand for our architectural coatings and traffic solutions products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the us canada and europe the latin america paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter these cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher cash from operating activities 

2020 ppg annual report and form 10k 7 

employee relations 

the average number of people employed worldwide by ppg during 2020 was approximately 46900 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2020 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our results of operations overall we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

human capital 

launched in 2019 the ppg way is how we enable empower and engage each employee to implement the strategies needed to strengthen our position as an industry leader it guides our employees and leaders as we strive to achieve our purpose of protecting and beautifying the world employee engagement is a measure of how authentically we are living our culture we conduct ppg pulse surveys multiple times each year even in the midst of the global pandemic in 2020 to increase dialogue among teams and implement meaningful action to improve results

  2020 ppg annual report and 10k 8 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including certain sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

our experience to date regarding environmental matters leads us to believe that we will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 300 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 100 million to 200 million these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites none of which are individually significant the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 



it is expected that capital expenditures for such projects in 2021 will be in the range of 15 million to 25 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of paints coatings and specialty materials we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

the effects of the recent covid19 pandemic have negatively impacted and are continuing to adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the effects of the public health crisis caused by the covid19 pandemic have interfered with the ability of ppg our suppliers customers and others to conduct business and have negatively affected consumer confidence and the global economy public health officials have recommended or mandated certain precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including prohibitions on congregating in groups shelterinplace orders or similar measures preventative and protective actions that public health officials governments or ppg have taken with respect to covid19 have and will continue to adversely impact our business suppliers distribution channels and customers including business shutdowns or 

2020 ppg annual report and form 10k 9 

disruptions for an indefinite period of time reduced operations reduced ability to supply products or reduced demand for our products our financial condition liquidity and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by these preventative actions and the disruption to our business and that of our suppliers and customers as we cannot predict the duration or scope of the covid19 pandemic the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials raw materials include both organic primarily petroleumderived materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide these raw materials represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

while not our customary practice we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins may be lower 

most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations our raw materials include biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy 

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future recently global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors including the covid19 pandemic slowing global growth consumer sentiment and commodity market volatility disruption in existing trade agreements the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs the united kingdom’s exit from the european union and weaker demand in china ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances in addition various laws regulate health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including those described in note 15 “commitments and 

  2020 ppg annual report and 10k 10 

contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against major currencies could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in us dollars 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations as well as interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs 

for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

further although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees agents business partners or businesses that we acquire any noncompliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our operations outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2020 by products sold outside the us was approximately 65 

changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to various taxes in both the us and nonus jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation further ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it becomes available recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities if our effective income tax rate was to increase our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

2020 ppg annual report and form 10k 11 

although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if future audits find that additional taxes are due we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations 

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events significant public health issues computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce our ability to supply products reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

part of the company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions over the last decade we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 

• difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business 

• delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products 

• diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns 

• difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter 

• unforeseen claims and liabilities including unexpected environmental exposures product liability or existing cyber vulnerability 

• unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business 

• difficulty in conforming the acquired business’ standards processes procedures and controls to those of our operations and 

• difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses 

these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs 

we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and selfdriving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings in addition through the introduction of new technologies new business models or new methods of travel such as ridesharing the number of automotive oem newbuilds may decline potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings and related automotive parts 

additionally the development of customerfacing digital platforms has and will continue to transform certain retail industries an inability to develop such solutions and our customer’s pace of adoption of those solutions could negatively affect our business or the market demand for our products 

our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose a large regional or global customer or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products additionally our ability to achieve price increases may impact the overall economics for the products we offer 

  2020 ppg annual report and 10k 12 

competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate   

increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches this could lead to negative publicity theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information manufacture of defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

in 2018 we concluded that previously issued financial statements as detailed below should not be relied upon and restated those previously issued financial statements which led to among other things shareholder litigation investigations by the sec and the us attorney’s office a settlement by the company with the sec and unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees and which may result in certain other risks 

as discussed in the explanatory note note 2 “restatement of previously reported consolidated annual financial statements” and in note 19 “quarterly financial information unaudited” under item 8 of the 2017 form 10ka in 2018 we concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of december 31 2017 and 2016 and for each of the quarterly and yeartodate periods in 2017 and the final quarterly and yeartodate period in 2016 should no longer be relied upon the determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that these financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements although the company restated these financial statements remediated the material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting reached a settlement with the sec and is no longer the subject of an investigation by the us attorney’s office we continue to be subject to risks and uncertainties relating to these events including advancement of legal expenses and potential indemnification obligations to certain current and former employees who are responding to investigations by the sec and us attorney’s office for alleged violations of the securities laws relating to the restatement described above potential loss of investor confidence potential reputational harm and a potential negative impact on our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims may relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury property damage and certain other claims ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers may contest coverage ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

as previously disclosed the sec is conducting a nonpublic investigation of accounting matters described in the explanatory note and in note 2 “restatement of previously reported consolidated annual financial statements under item 8 of the company’s 2017 form 10ka on september 26 2019 ppg announced a final settlement with the sec as to the company without admitting or denying the findings in the sec’s administrative ceaseanddesist order the company consented to the entry of the order which imposed no financial penalty the company continues to cooperate

the effective tax rate for the yearended december 31 2020 was 214 a decrease of 22 from the prior year the lower effective income tax rate included higher net benefits for changes in valuation allowance reserves and for us research and development credits the company expects that its full year 2021 effective tax rate will be between 22 and 24

regulation g reconciliations  results from operations 

ppg believes investor’s understanding of the company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income from continuing operations earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and ppg’s effective tax rate from continuing operations adjusted for certain items ppg’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations net income from continuing operations earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and the effective tax rate from continuing operations adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and should not be considered a substitute for net income earnings per diluted share the effective tax rate or other financial measures as computed in accordance with us gaap in addition adjusted net income adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and the adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies

industrial coatings 



industrial coatings segment net sales decreased due to the following 

 ● lower sales volumes 13 

 ● unfavorable foreign currency translation 1 

partially offset by 

 ● acquisitionrelated sales 1 

automotive oem coatings sales volumes decreased by approximately 15 yearoveryear driven by the significant curtailment in global automotive industry production rates due to the covid19 pandemic although sales volumes decreased yearoveryear strong sales volumes in china and the company’s strong technology and service capabilities led ppg to outpace the global industry build rate 

for the industrial coatings business net sales decreased by about 10 compared to prior year acquisitionrelated sales from whitford and modest increases in selling prices were more than offset by lower demand stemming from reduced industrial production in most regions due to customer shutdowns global industrial production improved during the second half of the year compared to the start of the pandemic

easier comparison due to the lower industrial activity in china during the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic it is expected that raw material logistics and certain other costs will be inflationary in early 2021 the company is planning or has instituted selling price increases to help mitigate these cost pressures along with continued execution of the previously announced restructuring initiatives finally foreign currency translation is expected to have a favorable impact on segment sales and earnings of about 40 million and 5 million respectively in the first quarter 2021 based on current exchange rates 

review and outlook 

during 2020 the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted global economic conditionsthe impact in the first quarter was concentrated in china and broadened to most of the rest of the world in the second quarter coatings enduse markets related to mobility were more negatively impacted such as the aerospace and automotive refinish coatings businesses some enduse markets benefited from the government mandated restrictions including architectural coatings diy and the packaged food segment ppg’s net sales excluding foreign currency translation impact decreased approximately 8 versus the prior year acquisitionrelated sales contributed 1 to net sales growth compared to prior year foreign currency translation was unfavorable throughout the year and impacted net sales by about 1 raw material costs moderated during the first half of the year and then increased sequentially throughout the second half of 2020 and are expected to continue to be inflationary into the first quarter of 2021 some other key costs continued to increase in 2020 such as logistics employee wage and benefit costs 

us and canada 

during 2020 economic activity was impacted by the covid19 pandemic with overall economic activity sharply falling in the first half of the year and then continuously improving in the second half of the year for the full year us gdp fell by about 5 automotive oem industry builds were down about 20 compared to 2019 with minimal production in the second quarter and improving trends in the secondhalf of the year demand in the residential and commercial construction markets were mixed in 2020 compared to 2019 new home starts advanced approximately 5 in 2020 versus approximately 2 in 2019 residential remodeling was up 2 in 2020 versus 2019 supported by stayathome mandates commercial construction was down approximately 10 compared to 2019 market demand for architectural paint shifted significantly to the diy channel during the year as higher us unemployment and increased workfromhome resulted in consumers choosing to spend more time renovating their homes ppg’s architectural coatings sales volumes in the us and canada were positively impacted by diy trends and negatively impacted by lower commercial demand trends the aerospace coatings business was significantly impacted by the pandemic before the pandemic the company’s sales mix was approximately 70 commercial and 30 military during the pandemic ppg sales volumes for military applications remained solid in part due to specification of ppg products with advantaged technology the commercial segment was down about 50 due to lower passenger miles flown and fewer industry oem builds the automotive refinish coatings business was impacted by stayathome mandates these mandates led to less commuting to work less congestion and fewer miles driven leading to lower collision claims ppg’s packaging coatings business was favorably impacted by higher packaged food demand ppg’s automotive oem coatings business performance was slightly below industry demand levels due to customer mix higher acquisitionrelated sales partially offset lower sales volumes in the automotive oem coatings business for the industrial coatings business acquisitionrelated sales and higher selling prices were more than offset by lower sales volumes the us and canada remained ppg’s largest region representing approximately 41 of 2020 net sales 

europe middle east and africa 

european economic activity was weak in 2020 industrial production and manufacturing rates in the region were lower than 2019 the region was impacted by continuing uncertainty over the united kingdom’s exit from the european union and overall contracting demand in most enduse markets that ppg supplies due to the pandemic regional demand continued to be mixed by country and enduse demand for ppg products was impacted by a decline in demand for automotive refinish automotive oem aerospace and general industrial coatings products demand for architectural and packaging coatings products was better led by higher coatings sales for architectural diy and the packaged food segment ppg’s architectural coatings  emea business’ organic sales were higher by a midsingledigit percentage driven by higher selling prices and higher sales volumes 

emea represented approximately 31 of ppg’s 2020 net sales similar to prior year levels regional coatings volumes remain approximately 20 below 2008 prerecession levels net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 as higher selling prices and acquisitionrelated sales were more than offset by lower sales volumes foreign currencies were relatively flat compared to 2019 

asia pacific and latin america 

the emerging regions of asia pacific and latin america represented 28 of ppg’s 2020 net sales in aggregate similar to the prior year 

2020 ppg annual report and form 10k 21 

asia pacific remained the largest emerging region with net sales of approximately 24 billion led by china which remained ppg’s second largest country by revenue overall net sales were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by lower demand of coatings products due to the pandemic first quarter sales in china were sharply lower due to a broad shutdown caused by the pandemic as the year progressed demand in china was the best of any major region and was higher than the levels seen in 2019 in each of the last three quarters of 2020 in china the automotive oem coatings business had retail sales higher than 2019 in each of the last 9 months of 2020 ppg’s organic sales in the asia pacific region were lower by about 5 as higher yearoveryear sales in china were more than offset by lower sales in india and southeast asia due to the pandemic 

overall demand in latin america declined yearoveryear driven by lower automotive industry builds and overall softer economic conditions in most countries including mexico in mexico the ppgcomex business added a net of approximately 80 new concessionaire locations the overall region’s performance was supported by strong growth in the packaging coatings business foreign currency translation was volatile and finished about 10 unfavorable compared to 2019 principally driven by weaker currencies including the mexican peso and brazilian real 

outlook 

looking ahead to 2021 we expect solid global market growth that will likely be uneven by region and enduse we expect regional growth rates to be higher than 2020 in all regions as demand continues to recover from the pandemic 

we anticipate ppg’s us and canada regional growth will be led by automotive oem and general industrial coatings as industrial production levels are expected to be higher than 2020 automotive oem builds are expected to be approximately a midteen percentage higher compared to 2020 we expect positive growth in housing and continued weakness in commercial construction and maintenance architectural diy demand is expected to remain at elevated levels in the first half of 2021 demand for aerospace and automotive refinish coatings is expected to remain subdued during the first half of 2021 

we expect industry demand trends in 2021 in europe to improve from those experienced in 2020 with continuing improvement in profitability due to margin improvement regional growth is expected to remain mixed by subregion and country favorable enduse trends are expected to continue in automotive oem and general industrial coatings overall demand is expected to be higher but be mixed by country in the architectural coatings business we continue to monitor the economic environment in the uk as its exit from the european union progresses and impacts consumer sentiment and coatings demand demand for aerospace and automotive refinish coatings is expected to remain soft 

in asia pacific we expect continued improvement in industrial production growth in china southeast asia and india as the year progresses in china we foresee continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption industrial production in india is expected to be sharply higher in 2021 from a very low level in 2020 due to the pandemic the recovery in marine coatings newbuild demand is expected to remain subdued 

in latin america we anticipate slightly better economic conditions in mexico most of central america and south america compared to 2020 we expect continued strong demand for the ppgcomex architectural coatings business 

significant other factors 

in june 2020 ppg initiated a 176 million pretax global restructuring program the program addresses weakened global economic conditions stemming from the covid19 pandemic and related pace of recovery in a few enduse markets along with further opportunities to optimize supply chain and functional costs the plan includes a voluntary separation program that was offered in the us and canada ppg recognized approximately 45 million of savings from this program in 2020 the majority of these restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2021 

we made significant progress on the global restructuring programs that were announced in may 2018 and june 2019 the company achieved approximately 70 million of savings in 2020 relating to these programs the majority of these restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2021 with the remainder of the actions expected to be completed by 2022 aggregate restructuring savings related to the 2020 2019 and 2018 programs was approximately 115 million in 2020 

we will continue to aggressively manage the company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and will make adjustments as required to remain cost competitive in the marketplace aggregate restructuring savings are expected to be at least 120 million in 2021 

raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates and global supply and demand factors in aggregate average raw material costs were modestly lower in 2020 versus 2019 due to variety of reasons including softer industry demand and lower crude oil prices ppg currently expects overall raw material prices to increase by a lowsingledigit percentage 

  2020 ppg annual report and 10k 22 

in the first quarter 2021 cost inflation is expected in several other areas including wage benefit and logistics costs in 2021 ppg expects certain regional logistics equipment shortages in 2021 impacting the company’s supply chain and distribution channels 

in 2020 we achieved selling price improvement primarily in the performance coatings reportable business segment reflecting the company’s efforts to offset various inflationary pressures further benefits from selling price actions are necessary in 2021 to recover operating margins reflecting the value of our products the company will carefully monitor all costs during 2021 and assess the need for additional selling price increases 

in 2020 we experienced unfavorable foreign currency translation throughout the year based on midjanuary 2021 exchange rates the company expects favorable yearoveryear foreign currency translation in 2021 the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2021 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from this expectation the company generally purchases raw materials incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction related impacts 

the 2021 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 22 to 24 varying by quarter this range represents the company’s best estimate 

over the past five years the company used over 39 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 35 million shares of ppg stock no shares were repurchased in 2020 the company ended the year with approximately 15 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization during 2020 the company deployed nearly 12 billion for acquisitions approximately 300 million for capital expenditures and approximately 495 million for dividends ppg increased its pershare dividend in september 2020 marking the 49th annual per share dividend increase and the 121st consecutive year of annual dividend payments 

ppg ended 2020 with approximately 19 billion in cash and shortterm investments the company expects continued strong cash generation in 2021

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits 

as discussed in item 3 and note 15 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

as also discussed in note 15 ppg has significant reserves for environmental contingencies please refer to the environmental matters section of note 15 for details of these reserves a significant portion of our reserves for environmental contingencies relate to ongoing remediation at ppgs former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city nj and associated sites new jersey chrome there are multiple future events yet to occur including further remedy selection and design remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey 

2020 ppg annual report and form 10k 23 

chrome sites further resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will continue to be adjusted 

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past two years ppg had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements to fund our capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



cash from operating activities  continuing operations 



2020 vs 2019 

the 45 million increase in cash from operating activities  continuing operations was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital excluding the impact of business acquisitions 

operating working capital 

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 receivables from customers net of allowance for doubtful accounts 2 inventories and 3 trade liabilities see note 4 “working capital detail” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses 

a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales fourth quarter sales annualized 



environmental expenditures 



we expect cash outlays for environmental remediation activities in 2021 to be between 80 million and 100 million 

defined benefit pension plan contributions 



contributions to ppg’s nonus defined benefit pension plans in 2020 were required by local funding requirements ppg expects to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the range of 10 million to 20 million in 2021 ppg may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2021 and beyond 

  2020 ppg annual report and 10k 24 

cash used for investing activities 



2020 vs 2019 

the 438 million increase in cash used for investing activities  continuing operations was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions 

capital expenditures including business acquisitions 



1 includes modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects 

capital expenditures related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects is expected to be approximately 450 million in 2021 reflecting a return to prepandemic levels of spending in support of future organic growth opportunities 

a primary focus for the company in 2021 will continue to be cash deployment focused on shareholder value creation with a preference for business acquisitions the nearterm cash deployment priority will be to complete the announced acquisitions using a combination of cash on hand and external financing 

cash used for financing activities 



2020 vs 2019 

the 699 million decrease in cash used for financing activities  continuing operations was primarily due the issuance of shortterm debt in 2020 and lower net purchases of treasury stock yearoveryear 

share repurchase activity 



the company has approximately 15 billion remaining under the current authorization from the board of directors which was approved in december 2017 the current authorized repurchase program has no expiration date

debt issued and repaid 





credit agreements and lines of credit 

in august 2019 ppg amended and restated its fiveyear credit agreement the “credit agreement” with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in note 10 borrowings and lines of credit under item 8 of this form 10k the credit agreement amends and restates the companys existing five year credit agreement dated as of december 18 2015 the credit agreement provides for a 22 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the credit agreement will terminate on august 30 2024 in march 2020 ppg borrowed 800 million under the credit agreement and repaid that amount in full in april 2020 there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 

the credit agreement also supports the company’s commercial paper borrowings which are classified as longterm based on ppg’s intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a longterm basis as of december 31 2020 and 2019 there were 250 million and 100 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding respectively 

the credit agreement requires the company to maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of 60 or less provided that for any fiscal quarter in which the company has made an acquisition for consideration in excess of 1 billion and for the next five fiscal quarters thereafter the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization may not exceed 65 at any time as of december 31 2020 total indebtedness to total capitalization as defined under the credit agreement and the term loan was 46 

in addition to the amounts available under lines of credit the company maintains access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time which may provide an additional source of liquidity

contractual obligations 

we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments cash from operations and the company’s access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending acquisitions dividend payments debt service share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations 



1 interest on all outstanding debt including finance lease obligations 

2 includes interest payments 

3 includes the high end of the range of the expected pension contributions for 2021 only as ppg is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2021 

4 the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases and electricity consistent with customary industry practice 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 10 “borrowings and lines of credit” under item 8 of this form 10k 

other liquidity matters 

at december 31 2020 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was 188 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” and note 13 “income taxes” under item 8 of this form 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this we make extensive use 

2020 ppg annual report and form 10k 27 

of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 14 “employee benefit plans” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

business combinations 

in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities 

the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test at least annually or more frequently if an indication of impairment arises the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount in the quantitative test fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include discount rates tax rates future revenues operating cash flows and capital expenditures for more information on these matters see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

comparing spot exchange rates at december 31 2020 and at december 31 2019 the us dollar strengthened against certain currencies in the countries where ppg operates most notably the mexican peso as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2020 decreased by 36 million from december 31 2019 comparing spot exchange rates at december 31 2019 and at december 31 2018 the us dollar weakened against certain currencies in the countries where ppg operates most notably the british pound canadian dollar and the mexican peso as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2019 increased by 106 million from december 31 2018 

comparing average exchange rates during 2020 to those of 2019 the us dollar strengthened against currencies of the countries within the regions ppg operates including emea and latin america this had an unfavorable impact of approximately 26 million on full year 2020 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars comparing average exchange rates during 2019 to those of 2018 the us dollar strengthened against currencies of the countries within the regions ppg operates including emea asia pacific and latin america this had an unfavorable impact of approximately 50 million on full year 2019 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include statements related to expected effects on our business of the covid19 pandemic global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by our competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to achieve selling price increases the ability to recover margins customer inventory levels our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in the markets we serve the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the results of governmental investigations and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 

consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things lower sales or income business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and was exposed to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 11 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk certain foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2020 and 2019 served as a hedge of a portion of ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 2 million as of december 31 2020 and a net liability of 7 million as of december 31 2019  the potential reduction in ppg’s income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european and canadian currencies and 20 for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 would have been 226 million and 357 million respectively 

in august 2019 and february 2018 ppg entered into us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts for 300 million and 575 million respectively with a combined notional amount of 875 million outstanding resulting in a net liability and a net asset with a fair value of 8 million and 48 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by 95 million and 87 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of  24 billion a nd 23 billion respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of 273 million and 255 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk of fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs in the first quarter of 2018 ppg entered into interest rate swaps which converted 525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt the fair value of these contracts was an asset of 67 million and 35 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively an increase in variable interest rates of 10 would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest expense by 1 million a nd 7 million for the periods ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south 

2020 ppg annual report and form 10k 29 

america would have an insignificant effect on ppg’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the periods ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 48 million a nd 67 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income before income taxes or cash flows

 item 1 business 

ppg industries inc manufactures and distributes a broad range of paints coatings and specialty materials ppg was incorporated in pennsylvania in 1883 ppg’s vision is to be the world’s leading coatings company by consistently delivering highquality innovative and sustainable solutions that customers trust to protect and beautify their products and surroundings 

ppg has a proud heritage and demonstrated commitment to innovation sustainability community engagement and developing leadingedge paint coatings and specialty materials technologies through dedication and industryleading expertise we solve our customers’ biggest challenges collaborating closely to find the right path forward ppg is a global leader serving customers in construction consumer products industrial and transportation markets and aftermarkets with manufacturing facilities and equity affiliates in more than 70 countries 

performance coatings and industrial coatings 

ppg’s business is comprised of two reportable business segments performance coatings and industrial coatings the performance coatings and industrial coatings reportable business segments supply coatings and specialty materials to customers in a wide array of enduses including industrial equipment and components packaging material aircraft and marine equipment automotive original equipment automotive refinish as well as for other industrial and consumer products ppg also serves commercial and residential new build and maintenance customers by supplying coatings to painting and maintenance contractors and directly to consumers for decoration and maintenance the coatings industry is highly competitive and consists of several large firms with global presence and many firms supplying local or regional markets ppg competes in its primary markets with the world’s largest coatings companies most of which have global operations and many regional coatings companies

research and development 



technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs additionally we operate laboratories in close geographic proximity to our customers and we customize our products for our customers enduse applications our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management we have obtained government funding for a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate 

we own and operate several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes in addition to the company’s centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 “properties” of this form 10k operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate global competitive sourcing laboratories because of our broad array of products and customers we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

raw materials energy and logistics 

the effective management of raw materials energy and logistics is important to ppg’s continued success as ppg uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses and sand and soda ash in the specialty coatings and materials business raw materials include both organic primarily petroleumderived materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide these raw materials represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible our raw materials include biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy while prices for certain raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand changes such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas inputs 

we are continuing our aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple sources of supply both local and international including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and reducing the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the european union and many other countries including china canada the united states “us” brazil mexico and south korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

ppg has joined a global initiative to eliminate child labor from the mica industry and the company is continuing to take steps including audits of our suppliers to ensure compliance with ppg’s policy against the use of child labor in our supply chains 

we typically experience fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates government regulation and global supply and demand factors for 2019 versus 2018 we experienced a deflationary movement in costs particularly in the second half of 2019 driven by a general slowdown in industrial demand affecting the global supply and demand balance in several of our key purchasing categories this was in addition to pricing decreases in most of our key feedstocks throughout 2019 in contrast average raw material costs rose by a midsingledigit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 due to the rise in feedstock prices acute shortages in key raw materials and the impact of chinese environmental regulations 

given the continuing volatility in certain energybased input costs particularly the volatility in oil and oilbased derivatives and foreign currencies we are not able to predict with certainty the 2020 fullyear impact of changes in raw material pricing 

10 2019 ppg annual report and 10k 

versus 2019 further given the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are sizable as are wage and benefit changes for 2019 versus 2018 we experienced a slight decrease in our logistics costs as a percentage of sales driven by operational efficiency improvements and through sourcing efforts to take advantage of the reduction in industry surface transportation shipping rates due to an improvement in the availability of transportation assets we expect these costs to remain steady or be slightly lower through 2020 given the continuing efforts by ppg to improve our global operational efficiencies 

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on our total net sales and income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets trade protection measures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2019  unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased net sales by approximately 400 million and income before income taxes by approximately 50 million  

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st are summarized below 



refer to note 21  “ reportable business segment information ” under item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppg’s property plant and equipment and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales 

seasonality 

ppg’s income before income taxes has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in our architectural coatings businesses demand for our architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the us canada and europe the latin america paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter these cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher cash from operating activities 

employee relations 

the average number of people employed worldwide by ppg during 2019 was approximately 47600 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2019 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our results of operations overall we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

environmental matters 

ppg is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals our sustainability efforts are led by the technology and environment committee of our board of directors and our sustainability committee which is comprised of members of ppg’s senior management team the sustainability committee establishes policies programs procedures and goals to address sustainability in our business practices including resource management climate change innovation communications purchasing manufacturing and employee wellness 

our dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability once again we increased the percent of our sales from sustainable products to 33 in 2019 from 32 in 2018 we are marketing an evergrowing variety of products and services that provide environmental safety and other benefits to our customers our products contribute to lighter more fuelefficient vehicles airplanes and ships and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption conserve water and reduce waste these products include a compact automotive paint process that saves energy and reduces water usage sustainable

waterborne coatings formulations lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft coatings that cool surfaces coatings for recyclable metal packaging and solutions for autonomous and batterypowered vehicles 

the company’s commitment to sustainability continues to yield tangible results in 2019 we again made significant progress reducing our energy intensity greenhouse gas emissions intensity and waste intensity more information about ppg’s sustainability values efforts goals and data and our community and employee engagement programs can be found in our sustainability report and on our sustainability website at httpsustainabilityppgcom and on the cdp’s website at wwwcdpnet 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including certain sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

our experience to date regarding environmental matters leads us to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 304 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 100 million to 200 million  these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites none of which are individually significant the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 



it is expected that capital expenditures for such projects in 2020 will be in the range of 20 million to 30 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of paints coatings and specialty materials we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

12 2019 ppg annual report and 10k 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials raw materials include both organic primarily petroleumderived materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide these raw materials represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

while not our customary practice we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins may be lower 

most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations our raw materials include biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy 

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future recently global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors including slowing global growth consumer sentiment and commodity market volatility disruption in existing trade agreements the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs the united kingdom’s exit from the european union and weaker demand in china ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances in addition various laws regulate health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including those described in note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” under item 8 of this form 10k will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

2019 ppg annual report and form 10k 13 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against major currencies could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in us dollars 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations as well as interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs 

for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

further although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees agents business partners or businesses that we acquire any noncompliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our operations outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2019 by products sold outside the us was approximately 61  

changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to various taxes in both the us and nonus jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation further ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it becomes available recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities if our effective income tax rate was to increase our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if future audits find that additional taxes are due we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events significant public health issues computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce our ability to supply products reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

part of the company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions over the last decade we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 

 these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs 

we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and selfdriving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings in addition through the introduction of new technologies new business models or new methods of travel such as ridesharing the number of automotive oem newbuilds may decline potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings and related automotive parts 

our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose a large regional or global customer or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products additionally our ability to achieve price increases may impact the overall economics for the products we offer competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate   

increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts 

2019 ppg annual report and form 10k 15

the effective tax rate for the yearended december 31 2019 was 236  an increase of 27 from the prior year in 2018 the tax rate benefited from certain favorable adjustments including finalization of the provisional toll charge recorded in 2017 for unremitted foreign earnings under the us tax cuts and jobs act

regulation g reconciliations  results from operations

architectural coatings  emea net sales decreased by a midsingledigit percentage due to unfavorable foreign currency translation however organic sales increased by a lowsingledigit percentage yearoveryear driven by higher selling prices despite volume growth in certain key countries sales volumes were lower yearoveryear 

automotive refinish coatings net sales were relatively flat versus the prior year including the increase in net sales from the sem acquisition sales volumes were impacted by softer us industry demand evidenced by lower collision claims during the year organic sales increased in all other major geographic regions as customers continued to adopt ppg’s industryleading technologies 

aerospace coatings net sales increased by over 10 versus the prior year driven by higher sales volumes this increase was supported by market outperformance in all major platforms stemming from technologyadvantaged products and robust industry demand 

protective and marine coatings increased net sales by a midsingledigit percentage versus the prior year driven by strong sales volumes in china and europe and price gains in each region net sales in the us were negatively impacted by reduced activity in the oil and gas sector 

segment income increased 109 million yearoveryear due to higher selling prices and the continued benefits from the company’s ongoing restructuring programs these benefits were partially offset by the earnings impact of lower sales volumes which were mostly attributable to the previously announced customer assortment changes and other cost inflation additionally unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased segment income by approximately 25 million primarily related to the weakening of key currencies including the mexican peso and euro 

looking ahead 

looking ahead industry demand levels in the first quarter of 2020 are expected to be similar to those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019 acquisitions are forecasted to add about 25 million of net sales primarily from dexmet texstars and icr in addition net sales will be impacted due to lower production rates by an aerospace customer based on current exchange rates foreign currency translation is not expected to have a material impact on segment sales or earnings

industrial coatings net sales increased slightly versus the prior year despite lower sales volumes due to weakening global manufacturing demand for certain enduse products lower sales volumes were more than offset by acquisitionrelated sales from the whitford acquisition 

packaging coatings net sales decreased by a midsingledigit percentage due to lower sales volumes versus the prior year yearoveryear volumes were impacted by lower demand in packaged foods however sales volumes increased in latin america due to customer conversions in the region during the year 

specialty coatings and materials net sales were lower by a lowsingledigit percentage versus the prior year despite sales volume growth in the us and emea

looking ahead 

looking ahead global industrial demand trends are expected to remain subdued through the first quarter of 2020 with inconsistencies by region significant public health issues could have an unfavorable impact in certain industries and regions the company will continue to prioritize operating margin recovery focusing on executing its cost savings program and implementing contingency actions where necessary acquisitionrelated sales are forecast to add about 60 million stemming from whitford and hemmelrath based on current exchange rates foreign currency translation is not expected to have a material impact on segment sales or earnings 

review and outlook 

during 2019 economic conditions were generally positive in all of our major geographic regions despite soft global manufacturing activity that weakened during the year and remained mixed by enduses ppg’s net sales excluding foreign currency translation impact grew approximately 1 versus the prior year acquisitionrelated sales from acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2019 contributed 2 to net sales growth yearoveryear net of dispositions foreign currency translation was unfavorable throughout the year and impacted net sales by about 3 raw material costs moderated during the year but remain elevated after a multiyear inflationary period some other key costs continued to increase in 2019 such as employee wage and benefit costs 

us and canada 

during 2019 the pace of economic growth moderated in the us and canada versus the prior year led by weaker us gdp growth automotive oem industry builds were relatively flat compared to 2018 demand in the residential and commercial construction markets was modestly higher in 2019 compared to 2018 new home starts advanced approximately 2 in 2019 versus approximately 4 in 2018 residential remodeling was down 2 in 2019 versus 2018 while commercial construction was down approximately 4 compared to flat in 2018 market demand for architectural paint continued to shift more to professional trade painters as continued lower us unemployment resulted in consumers choosing professional painters 

24 2019 ppg annual report and 10k 

rather than completing projects themselves although demand in us doityourself diy paint stores was stable after several years of weaker trends ppg’s architectural coatings sales volumes in the us and canada was impacted by diy customer assortment changes that reduced net sales by more than 100 million the aerospace coatings business had abovemarket sales volume growth of nearly a doubledigit percentage yearoveryear the automotive refinish coatings business was impacted by lower collision rates changes to inventory management by our customers and a continuing trend of a higher number of automobiles in accidents being scrapped rather than being repaired and repainted offsetting modest growth in miles driven ppg’s packaging coatings business was impacted by lower packaged food demand which offset growth in the packaged beverage segment ppg’s automotive oem coatings business performance was slightly below industry demand levels due to customer mix higher selling prices and acquisitionrelated sales nearly offset lower sales volumes in the automotive oem coatings business for the industrial coatings business acquisitionrelated sales and higher selling prices were partially offset by lower sales volumes the us and canada remained ppg’s largest region representing approximately 43 of 2019 net sales 

europe middle east and africa 

european economic activity was weak in 2019 industrial production and manufacturing rates in the region were lower than 2018 and worsened as the year progressed the region was impacted by continuing uncertainty over the united kingdom’s exit from the european union and overall contracting demand in most of the enduse markets that ppg supplies regional demand continued to be mixed by country and enduses demand for ppg’s products was impacted by a decline in automotive industry builds and soft manufacturing activity in most of the general industrial coatings subsegments ppg’s architectural coatings  emea business organic sales were higher by a lowsingledigit percentage as higher selling prices offset lower sales volumes 

emea represented approximately 30 of ppg’s 2019 net sales similar to prior year levels regional coatings volumes remain approximately 20 below 2008 prerecession levels net sales excluding the impact of foreign translation increased in 2019 compared to 2018 as higher selling prices and acquisitionrelated sales more than offset lower sales volumes the euro and british pound both depreciated against the us dollar during 2019 

asia pacific and latin america 

the emerging regions of asia pacific and latin america represented 27 of ppg’s 2019 net sales in aggregate similar to the prior year 

asia pacific remained the largest emerging region with net sales of approximately 25 billion led by china which remained ppg’s second largest country by revenue the performance coatings segment grew sales volumes in asia pacific led by strong sales volume growth in the protective and marine coatings and aerospace coatings businesses sales volumes in the industrial coatings segment were lower by a highsingledigit percentage yearoveryear mostly due to a decline in the automotive oem coatings business particularly in china and india where new automobile sales were lower and a decline in the industrial coatings business driven by weakening global manufacturing demand 

overall demand in latin america declined yearoveryear driven by lower automotive industry builds and overall softer economic conditions in most countries including a weak trading environment in mexico in mexico the ppgcomex business added a net of approximately 160 new concessionaire locations the overall region’s performance was supported by strong growth in the packaging coatings business weaker sales volumes were offset by higher selling prices foreign currency translation was volatile and finished 2 unfavorable compared to 2018 principally driven by weaker currencies including the mexican peso and brazilian real 

outlook 

looking ahead to 2020 we expect modest global market growth that will likely be uneven by region and enduse we expect most regional growth rates to be similar to 2019 with the softest conditions expected in the emea region 

we anticipate ppg’s us and canada regional growth will be led by aerospace coatings albeit at lower levels than 2019 due to expected production curtailments at one customer especially in the first half of the year automotive oem builds are expected to be relatively flat compared to 2019 we expect modestly positive growth in housing and commercial construction 

we expect similar industry demand trends in 2020 in europe as those experienced in 2019 with continuing improvement in profitability due to margin improvement regional growth is expected to remain mixed by subregion and country favorable enduse trends are expected to continue in aerospace coatings with the potential for heightened volatility in automotive oem builds due to new regional emission standards industrial coatings demand is expected to remain soft as industry growth rates are anticipated to be flat to modestly lower demand is expected to contract but be mixed by country in the architectural coatings business we continue to monitor the economic environment in the uk as its exit from the european union progresses and impacts consumer sentiment and coatings demand 

2019 ppg annual report and form 10k 25 

in asia pacific we expect improved industrial production growth in china southeast asia and india as the year progresses in china we foresee continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption the sharp decline in automotive oem activity realized in the past 18 months is expected to moderate and improve as 2020 progresses with yearoveryear demand patterns expected to become more favorable in the second half of 2020 the recovery in marine coatings newbuild demand is expected to remain subdued 

in latin america we anticipate slightly better economic conditions in mexico most of central america and south america compared to 2019 

significant other factors 

in june 2019 ppg initiated a 184 million global restructuring program the program is the result of a comprehensive internal operational assessment to identify further opportunities to improve profitability of the overall business portfolio ppg recognized approximately 15 million of savings from this program in 2019 the majority of restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter 2020 with the remainder of the actions expected to be completed in 2022 

we made significant progress on the global restructuring programs that were announced in december 2016 and may 2018 the company achieved approximately 70 million of savings in 2019 relating to these programs these restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2020 aggregate restructuring savings related to the 2019 2018 and 2016 programs was approximately 85 million in 2019 

we will continue to aggressively manage the company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and will make adjustments as required to remain cost competitive in the marketplace aggregate restructuring savings are expected to be at least 75 million in 2020 

raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates and global supply and demand factors in aggregate average raw material costs were modestly lower in 2019 versus 2018 due to variety of reasons including softer industry demand and lower crude oil prices ppg currently expects overall raw material prices to be impacted by weak industrial supply and demand conditions in 2020 cost inflation is expected in several other areas including wage benefit and logistics costs in 2020 

in 2019 we achieved broad selling price improvement reflecting the company’s efforts to offset inflationary pressures further benefits from selling price actions are necessary in 2020 to recover operating margins reflecting the value of our products the company will carefully monitor all costs during 2020 and assess the need for additional selling price increases 

in 2019 we experienced unfavorable foreign currency translation throughout the year based on midjanuary 2020 exchange rates the company does not expect yearoveryear foreign currency translation to significantly impact 2020 net sales or income before income taxes the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2020 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from this expectation the company generally purchases raw materials incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction related impacts 

we are monitoring the potential impact of the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in china which could negatively impact our global business and results of operations in 2020 

the 2020 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 22 to 24 this range represents the company’s best estimate including recent updates to the 2017 the us tax cuts and jobs act 

over the past five years the company used over 45 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 45 million shares of ppg stock including 325 million in 2019 the company ended the year with approximately 15 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization during 2019 the company deployed nearly 700 million for acquisitions including the purchase of a remaining minority interest and approximately 470 million for dividends ppg increased its pershare dividend in september 2019 marking the 48th annual per share dividend increase and the 120th consecutive year of annual dividend payments 

ppg ended 2019 with approximately 13 billion in cash and shortterm investments the company expects continued strong cash generation in 2020

as discussed in item 3 and note 14  although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

as also discussed in note 14  ppg has significant reserves for environmental contingencies please refer to the environmental matters section of note 14 for details of these reserves a significant portion of our reserves for environmental contingencies relate to ongoing remediation at ppgs former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city nj and associated sites new jersey chrome there are multiple future events yet to occur including further remedy selection and design remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey chrome sites further resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will continue to be adjusted

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



cash from operating activities  continuing operations 



2019 vs 2018 

the 597 million increase in cash from operating activities  continuing operations was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital excluding the impact of business acquisitions and lower cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans yearoveryear

cash used for financing activities 



2019 vs 2018

contractual obligations 

we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments cash from operations and the company’s access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending acquisitions dividend payments debt service share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations are presented in the following table 



 other liquidity matters 

at december 31 2019 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was 177 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 9  “ borrowings and lines of credit ” under item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” and note 12  “ income taxes ” under item 8 of this form 10k 

30 2019 ppg annual report and 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 13  “ employee benefit plans ” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

business combinations 

in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities 

the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test at least annually or more frequently if an indication of impairment arises the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount in the quantitative test fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include discount rates tax rates future revenues operating cash flows and capital expenditures for more information on these matters see note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

comparing spot exchange rates at december 31 2018 and at december 31 2019 the us dollar weakened against certain currencies in the countries where ppg operates most notably the british pound canadian dollar and the mexican peso as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2019 increased by 106 million from december 31 2018 comparing spot exchange rates at december 31 2017 and at december 31 2018 the us dollar strengthened against certain other major currencies associated with countries in which ppg operates most notably the australian dollar british pound chinese yuan euro and south korean won as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2018 decreased by approximately 167 million from december 31 2017 

comparing average exchange rates during 2019 to those of 2018 the us dollar strengthened against currencies of the countries within the regions ppg operates including emea asia pacific and latin america this had an unfavorable impact of approximately 50 million on full year 2019 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars comparing average exchange rates during 2018 to those of 2017 in the countries in which ppg operates there was a favorable impact of 21 million on full year 2018 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars 

forwardlooking statements 

management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking 

2019 ppg annual report and form 10k 31 

statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to achieve selling price increases the ability to recover margins customer inventory levels our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in the markets we serve the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the results of governmental investigations and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 

consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things lower sales or income business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and was exposed to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 10  “ financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements ” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk certain foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2019 and 2018 were designated as a hedge of ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 7 million and a net asset of 36 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european and canadian currencies and 20 for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 would have been 357 million and 291 million respectively 

in august 2019 and february 2018 ppg entered into us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts for 300 million and 575 million respectively with a combined notional amount of 875 million outstanding resulting in a net asset with a fair value of 48 million and 35 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by 87 million and 57 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 23 billion and 26 billion respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of 255 million and 299 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk of fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs in the first quarter of 2018 ppg entered into interest rate swaps which converted 525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt the fair value of these contracts was an asset of 35 million and 8 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively an increase in variable interest rates of 10 would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest 

32 2019 ppg annual report and 10k 

expense by 7 million and 10 million for the periods ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the periods ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 67 million and 84 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income before income taxes or cash flows

 item 1 business 

ppg industries inc manufactures and distributes a broad range of paints coatings and specialty materials ppg was incorporated in pennsylvania in 1883 ppg’s vision is to be the world’s leading coatings company by consistently delivering highquality innovative and sustainable solutions that customers trust to protect and beautify their products and surroundings ppg’s business is comprised of two reportable business segments performance coatings and industrial coatings 

performance coatings and industrial coatings 

ppg is a major global supplier of coatings the performance coatings and industrial coatings reportable business segments supply coatings and specialty materials to customers in a wide array of enduses including industrial equipment and components packaging material aircraft and marine equipment automotive original equipment “automotive oem” automotive refinish as well as for other industrial and consumer products ppg also serves commercial and residential new build and maintenance customers by supplying coatings to painting and maintenance contractors and directly to consumers for decoration and maintenance the coatings industry is highly competitive and consists of several large firms with global presence and many smaller firms serving local or regional markets ppg competes in its primary markets with the world’s largest coatings companies most of which have global operations and many smaller regional coatings companies

research and development 



a  prior year amounts have been recast for the adoption of accounting standards update no 201707 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost” see note 1  within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management we have obtained government funding for a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate 

ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes in addition to the company’s centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 “properties” of this form 10k operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success ppg uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products that provide broad ranging high performance solutions to our customers the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses and sand and soda ash for the specialty coatings and materials business coatings raw materials include both organic primarily petroleumderived materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide these raw materials represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy while prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas 

the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards ppg has joined a global initiative to eliminate child labor from the mica industry and the company is continuing to take steps including audits of our suppliers to ensure compliance with ppg’s zerotolerance policy against the use of child labor in their supply chains 

changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the eu and many other countries including china canada the united states us brazil mexico and korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

given the recent volatility in certain energybased input costs and foreign currencies the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2019 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing versus 2018 however ppg currently expects overall coatings raw material costs to increase a lowsingledigit percentage in the first half of 2019 with impacts varied by region and commodity further given the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are sizable as are wages and benefits but to a lesser degree ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates government regulation and global supply and demand factors in aggregate average 

18  2018 ppg annual report and 10k 

raw material cost inflation rose by a midsingledigit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 and a comparable amount in 2017 versus 2016 driven by supply shortages the rise in crude oil and feedstock prices chinese environmental regulations and new tariffs in addition freight and logistics costs increased by a lowteendigit percentage due to higher fuel costs lack of transportation availability and other reasons  

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on ppg’s total net sales and income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets trade protection measures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2018  favorable foreign currency translation increased net sales by approximately 100 million  and income before income taxes by 20 million  foreign currency translation was favorable in the first half of the year partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation in the second half of the year 

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st  are summarized below 



refer to note 20  “ reportable business segment information ” under item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppg’s property plant and equipment and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales 

seasonality 

ppg’s income from continuing operations has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the us canada and europe the latin america paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter these cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher cash from operating activities 

employee relations 

the average number of people employed worldwide by ppg during 2018 was approximately 47300 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2018 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s results of operations overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees   

environmental matters 

ppg is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals our sustainability efforts are led by the technology and environment committee of our board of directors and our sustainability committee which is comprised of members of ppg’s senior management team the sustainability committee establishes policies programs procedures and goals to address sustainability in our business practices including resource management climate change innovation communications purchasing manufacturing and employee wellness 

our dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability once again in 2018 we increased the percent of our sales from sustainable products we are marketing an evergrowing variety of products and services that provide environmental safety and other benefits to our customers our products contribute to lighter more fuelefficient vehicles airplanes and ships and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption conserve water and reduce waste these products include a compact automotive paint process that saves energy and reduces water usage sustainable waterborne coatings

formulations lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft coatings that cool surfaces and solutions for autonomous and batterypowered vehicles 

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions while ppg has operations in many countries a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project 

ppg participates in both the us department of energy better buildings® better plants® program formerly the save energy now® leadership program and the environmental protection agency energy star® industrial partnership program both reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity these programs include developing and implementing energy management processes and setting energy savings targets while providing a suite of educational training and technical resources to help meet those targets recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area 

our commitment to sustainability continues to yield tangible results in 2018 we again made significant progress reducing our energy intensity ghg emissions intensity water usage intensity and waste intensity more information about ppg’s sustainability values efforts goals and data and our community and employee engagement programs can be found in our sustainability report and on our sustainability website at httpsustainabilityppgcom and on the cdp’s website at wwwcdpnet 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 124 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 22 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 291 million  currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 100 million  to 200 million  these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites none of which are individually significant the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 



it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2019 will be in the range of 25 million to 35 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of paints coatings and specialty materials we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials coatings raw materials include both organic primarily petroleumderived materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide these raw materials represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

while not our customary practice we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins may be lower 

most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy 

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during 2018 economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by enduse market demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future recently global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors including slowing global growth global stock and commodity market volatility disruption in existing trade agreements the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs the united kingdom’s exit from the european union weaker demand in china and increasing interest rates in the united states ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous waste the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and regulate various health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result 

2018 ppg annual report and form 10k 21 

in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including those described in note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” under item 8 of this form 10k will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against major currencies could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in us dollars 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations as well as interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs 

for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

further although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees agents business partners or businesses that we acquire any noncompliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our operations outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2018 by products sold outside the us was approximately 62

changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to various taxes in both the us and nonus jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation further ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities if our effective income tax rate was to increase our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if future audits find that additional taxes are due we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations 

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce our ability to supply products reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

part of the company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions over the last decade we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 

 these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs 

we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and selfdriving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings in addition through the introduction of new technologies new business models or new methods of travel such as ridesharing the number of automotive oem newbuilds may decline potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings and related automotive parts 

2018 ppg annual report and form 10k 23 

our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose a large regional or global customer or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate   

increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches this could lead to negative publicity theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information manufacture of defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we have concluded that previously issued financial statements as detailed below should not be relied upon and have restated those previously issued financial statements which has led to among other things shareholder litigation investigations by the sec and the us attorney’s office and unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees and may result in certain other risks 

as discussed in the explanatory note note 2 “restatement of previously reported consolidated annual financial statements” and in note 19 “quarterly financial information unaudited” under item 8 of the 2017 form 10ka we have concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of december 31 2017 and 2016 and for each of the quarterly and yeartodate periods in 2017 and the final quarterly and yeartodate period in 2016 should no longer be relied upon the determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that these financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements although the company has restated these financial statements and the material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting has been remediated as a result of these misstatements we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement the outcome of our shareholder litigation and government investigations potential loss of investor confidence and a negative impact on our stock price our shareholder litigation and the government investigations could result in substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation or investigation if we do not prevail in any such litigation we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs 

we are involved in investigations by the sec and the us attorney’s office which are costly to conduct and may result in substantial financial and other penalties as well as adverse effects on our business and financial condition 

in connection with the audit committee’s review of alleged violations of our accounting policies and procedures we selfreported this matter to the sec we are cooperating with the sec and the us attorney’s office in their investigations of this matter these investigations are continuing and we are currently unable to predict their duration scope or results or whether the sec or us attorney will commence any legal action if we are found to have violated securities laws or other federal statutes we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement civil and criminal fines and penalties modifications of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation revenues results of operations and financial condition

architectural coatings  americas and asiapacific sales volumes decreased by a lowsingledigit percentage versus the prior year sales volumes were positive yearoveryear in the us and canada companyowned store network as well as in mexico central america australia and brazil this growth was more than offset by lower diy and independent dealer network channel declines including the unfavorable impact from a customer assortment change in the us architectural diy channel in february 2018 ppg announced that lowe’s would discontinue the sale of olympic® brand paints and stains in its us retail stores effective mid2018 during the second quarter 2018 the company launched its olympic® stain products at the home depot®’s us retail stores expanding an existing partnership arrangement the net impact of these customer assortment changes resulted in net sales being lower by approximately 100 million in 2018

2018 ppg annual report and form 10k 33 

the unfavorable impact from natural disasters in the third quarter 2017 this increase was more than offset by sales volume declines in the us and canada independent dealer networks and national retail diy customer accounts as both distribution channels continued to experience soft demand organic sales improved in both the latin america and asia pacific regions 

architectural coatings  emea net sales increased by a highsingledigit percentage yearoveryear primarily due to acquisitionrelated sales principally deutek and univer which contributed approximately 85 million to net sales sales volumes were down yearoveryear primarily driven by continued weak demand in france and eastern europe as well as our turning away certain business due to low profitability or lack of customer acceptance of selling price increases demand growth continued in northern europe where we continued to outperform the market 

automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a lowsingledigit percentage yearoveryear led by abovemarket performance in us and canada as customers continued to adopt ppg’s industry leading technologies organic sales also increased in the latin american region versus the prior year reflecting high enduse market demand in asia pacific net sales increased largely due to the recent futian xinshi acquisition in china

protective and marine coatings sales volumes declined by a midsingledigit percentage yearoveryear protective coatings sales volumes expanded in most regions led by europe but were more than offset by significant weakness in new shipbuilding activity primarily in the asia pacific region 

segment income decreased 9 million yearoveryear primarily due increasing raw material costs wage and other cost inflation and lower sales volumes partially offset by selling price increases lower overhead and manufacturing costs including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions 

looking ahead 

looking ahead yearoveryear raw material cost inflation is expected in the first half of 2019 primarily due to carryover inflation acquisition related sales are forecast to add a lowsingledigit percentage of sales growth primarily from the sem acquisition and based on current exchange rates we expect foreign currency translation to have an unfavorable impact on segment sales of approximately 100 million in the first quarter 

additionally further selling price increases are expected in 2019 as we continue to offset the cumulative impact of raw material inflation over the past nine quarters net sales are expected to be lower in the first half compared to 2018 driven by lower us diy sales of approximately 110 million due to the customer assortment changes that occurred in 2018 the impact will be larger than the impact realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the seasonality of the us diy business

packaging coatings sales volumes grew by a midsingledigit percentage yearoveryear primarily driven by ongoing industry conversions to ppg’s new can coatings technologies led by the us 

segment income decreased 81 million yearoveryear primarily due to increasing raw material costs lower selling prices and wage and other cost inflation these cost increases were partially offset by income from higher sales volumes lower manufacturing and overhead costs including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions and acquisitionrelated income

looking ahead 

looking ahead we expect that greater volatility in global industrial demand will continue through the first quarter of 2019 with inconsistencies by region the carryover impact from 2018 cost inflation and significantly unfavorable foreign currency translation will impact first quarter earnings the company will continue to prioritize implementing selling price increases and operating margin recovery 

global automotive oem industry demand is expected to remain soft in the first quarter for most major regions with greater volatility expected in china we anticipate that aggregate global general industrial demand growth will continue but at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter of 2019 in addition we expect that the whitford acquisition will close during the latter portion of the first quarter pending required regulatory approvals and therefore will not provide meaningful sales or earnings benefit in the quarter in addition we expect packaging sales volumes to moderate as the pace of technology conversions slow in 2019 

review and outlook 

during 2018 economic conditions were generally positive in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by enduses ppg’s aggregate organic sales grew approximately 3 versus the prior year acquisitionrelated sales from two acquisitions completed in 2017 and the four completed in 2018 contributed approximately 1 to net sales growth yearoveryear net of dispositions foreign currency translation was favorable for the first half of the year then turned unfavorable in the second half of the year for the full year 2018 foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately 1 raw material inflation was elevated throughout the year and overall rose a midsingle digit percentage driven by supply related factors including government mandated production curtailments in china to help improve pollution and higher oil prices in addition logistics costs were significantly higher in 2018 driven by higher oil prices and shortages in the availability in transportation 

us and canada 

during 2018 the pace of economic activity improved in the us and canada region versus the prior year led by stronger gdp growth in the us despite flat automotive industry builds demand in the residential and commercial construction markets was modestly higher in 2018 compared to 2017 new home starts advanced approximately 4 in 2018 versus approximately 3 in 2017 residential remodeling was flat in 2018 versus 2017 while commercial construction was flat compared to a 1 decline in 2017 market demand for architectural paint continued to shift more to the professional trade painters channel as the continued decline in us unemployment resulted in consumers choosing professional painters rather than completing projects themselves demand in us doityourself diy paint stores continued to remain soft throughout the year consistent with 2017 ppg’s architectural coatings performance in the us and canada was impacted by diy customer assortment changes that unfavorably impacted sales by approximately 100 million the automotive refinish coatings business was impacted by lower collision rates and a higher number of automobiles in accidents being totaled rather than repainted offsetting modest growth in miles driven ppg’s packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of ppg’s new interior can coatings technologies ppg’s automotive oem coatings business performance was slightly better than industry demand levels due to modest share gains the us and canada region remained ppg’s largest representing approximately 42  of 2018 sales although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year 

europe middle east and africa 

european economic activity was mixed in 2018 industrial production was higher in the first half of the year and moderated as the year progressed the region was impacted by continuing uncertainty over the united kingdom’s exit from the european union overall gdp and industrial production were similar to 2017 in the region regional demand continued to be mixed by country and enduses demand for ppg’s products in several enduses drove the regional growth rate including above market performance in general industrial coatings packaging coatings and specialty coatings and materials ppg’s architectural coatings  emea business sales volumes decreased yearoveryear driven by soft demand in southern europe 

emea represented approximately 30  of ppg’s 2018 sales similar to prior year levels regional coatings volumes remain approximately 15 below their prerecession levels in 2008 the modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region ppg expects modest volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand in the second half of the year the euro and british pound both depreciated against the us dollar 

asia pacific and latin america 

the emerging regions of asia pacific and latin america represented 28  of ppg’s 2018 sales in aggregate similar to the prior year 

36  2018 ppg annual report and 10k 

asia remained the largest emerging region with sales of approximately 25 billion led by china which continued as ppg’s second largest country by revenue the performance coatings segment led sales volume growth in asia in part due to strong sales volume growth in protective and marine coatings aerospace coatings and automotive refinish coatings these increases were partially offset by a decline in automotive oem coatings particularly in china where industry retail automobile sales fell for the first time in over 25 years 

overall demand in latin america improved yearoveryear for the second consecutive year with continued above market growth in mexico and central america economic conditions were mixed in south america and there was heightened currency volatility throughout the entire region in mexico the ppgcomex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations the overall region’s performance was supported by strong growth in the general industrial and packaging coatings businesses foreign currency translation was volatile and finished 4 percent unfavorable compared to 2017 principally the mexican peso and brazilian real 

outlook 

looking ahead to 2019 we expect global market growth to continue but we expect a downshift in the pace of growth and it will likely be uneven by region and enduse we expect most regional growth rates to be modestly lower than 2018 but the latin america region growth rate to be slightly higher 

we anticipate ppg’s us and canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and aerospace coatings with flat automotive industry builds we expect growth in housing and commercial construction to be comparable to 2018 

we expect demand in europe to grow but at lower levels than 2018 regional growth is expected to remain mixed by subregion and country favorable enduse trends are expected to continue in general industrial and packaging with flattening demand in automotive oem coatings as industry growth rates are anticipated to be flat demand is expected to stay subdued in the architectural coatings business we continue to monitor the economic environment in the uk as their exit from the european union progresses and impacts consumer sentiment and coatings demand 

in asia pacific we expect continued industrial production growth in china southeast asia and india in china we foresee continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption the sharp decline in automotive oem activity seen in the second half of 2018 is expected to continue in the beginning of 2019 we expect yearoveryear demand patterns to become more favorable in the second half of 2019 the recovery in marine coatings demand is expected to continue albeit off a low base 

in latin america we anticipate economic expansion will continue in mexico most of central america and south america 

significant other factors 

in may 2018 ppg initiated an 83 million global restructuring program the program is largely centered around the change in customer assortment related to the us architectural coatings diy business ppg recognized 18 million of savings from this program in 2018 

significant progress was made on the global restructuring program that was announced in december 2016 this program targeted annual savings of approximately 125 million once fully implemented the company achieved approximately 60 million of savings in 2018 bringing the total savings to approximately 110 million to date 

we expect to achieve the fullannualized target of 125 million in 2019 we will continue to aggressively manage the company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and we will make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace restructuring savings from the 2018 and 2016 programs are expected to be between 60 million and 70 million in 2019 

raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates and global supply and demand factors in aggregate average raw material costs were higher by a midsingledigit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 due to variety of reasons including supplier force majeure environmental regulation enforcement and higher crude oil prices ppg currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a lowsingledigit percentage in the first half of 2019 with impacts varied by region and commodity marking the tenth and eleventh consecutive quarters of inflation in addition logistics costs were inflated throughout the year driven by higher crude oil prices and availability of transportation logistics costs are expected to further increase in 2019 

in 2018 we achieved broad selling price improvement reflecting the company’s efforts to offset higher raw material costs further benefits from selling price actions are necessary in 2019 to recover profit contribution margins the company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2019 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices for increases in these costs 

2018 ppg annual report and form 10k 37 

pension and postretirement benefit costs excluding settlements curtailments and special termination benefits totaled approximately 30 million in 2018 down approximately 20 million from 2017 in 2019 we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs will be approximately 30 million similar to 2018 

ppg contributed 75 million to its us defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and 54 million in 2017 in 2018 the company made contributions aggregating 24 million to its nonus defined benefit pension plans in 2019 mandatory contributions to ppg’s nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between 20 million and 30 million 

in 2018 favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half of the year was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year based on midjanuary 2019 exchange rates the company expects yearoveryear unfavorable foreign currency translation to decrease 2019 sales by 400 million to 500 million and 2019 income before income taxes by 50 million to 70 million we expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2019 due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2019 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from this estimate the company generally purchases raw materials incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction related impacts 

the 2019 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23 to 25 this range represents the company’s best estimate including updated guidance for the 2017 the us tax cuts and jobs act 

over the past five years the company used over 5 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 50 million shares of ppg stock including approximately 17 billion in 2018 the company ended the year with approximately 18 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization during 2018 the company deployed approximately 380 million for acquisitions and 450 million for dividends ppg increased its pershare dividend in october 2018 marking the 47th annual per share dividend increase and the 119th consecutive year of annual dividend payments 

ppg ended 2018 with approximately 1 billion in cash and shortterm investments the company expects continued strong cash generation in 2019

accounting standards to be adopted in future years 

note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under item 8 of this form 10k describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to december 31 2018  but are not effective until a future date 

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits 

as discussed in item 3 and note 14  although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

the company continues to analyze assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppg’s former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city nj and associated sites “new jersey chrome” information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the new jersey department of environmental protection in 2021 

there are multiple future events yet to occur including further remedy selection and design remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals considerable uncertainty exists 

38  2018 ppg annual report and 10k 

regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey chrome sites final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted 

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements to fund our capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



cash from operating activities  continuing operations 



2018 vs 2017 

the 64 million decrease in cash from operating activities  continuing operations was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and lower income in 2018 partially offset by lower cash taxes 

2017 vs 2016 

the 333 million increase in cash from operating activities  continuing operations was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the pittsburgh corning asbestos trust the “trust” lower defined benefit pension contributions lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital 

operating working capital 

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 receivables from customers net of allowance for doubtful accounts 2 inventories and 3 trade liabilities see note 4  “ working capital detail ” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses 

a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales fourth quarter sales annualized

asbestos settlement trust funding 

in june 2016 ppg fully funded its portion of the trust that was established by the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania in may 2016 ppg’s total cash obligations to fund the trust totaled 813 million pretax all payments were applied against a previously established ppg reserve for the total asbestos trust obligation the company utilized cash on hand for the payments and this funding had no impact on ppg’s previously stated cashdeployment targets refer to note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

cash used for investing activities  continuing operations 



2018 vs 2017 

the 701 million increase in cash used for investing activities  continuing operations was primarily due to the absence of the prior year proceeds from the sale of the north american fiber glass business and higher capital expenditures including business acquisitions 

2017 vs 2016 

the 535 million decrease in cash used forfrom investing activities  continuing operations was primarily due to the absence of the prior year proceeds from the sale of the flat glass business european fiber glass business and two asian joint ventures as well as lower capital expenditures including business acquisitions partially offset by the current year proceeds from the sale of the north american fiber glass business 

capital expenditures including business acquisitions   



1 includes modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects 

2 including cash acquired business acquisitions totaled 387 million 332 million and 362 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

capital expenditures related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects is expected to be in the range of 25 to 30 of sales during 2019 

a primary focus for the company in 2019 will continue to be cash deployment focused on shareholder value creation with a preference for business acquisitions 

cash proceeds from divestitures 

in september 2017 ppg completed the sale of its north american fiber glass business to nippon electric glass co and received approximately 540 million in pretax cash proceeds

40  2018 ppg annual report and 10k 

cash used for financing activities  continuing operations 



2018 vs 2017 

the 749 million decrease in cash used for financing activities  continuing operations was primarily due to the issuance of long term debt partially offset by higher net purchases of treasury stock yearoveryear 

2017 vs 2016 

the 744 million increase in cash used for financing activities  continuing operations was primarily due to repayment of long term debt and higher dividends in 2017 partially offset by issuance of long term debt in 2016 and lower net purchases of treasury stock yearoveryear 

share repurchase activity 

the company has approximately 18 billion remaining under the current authorization from the board of directors which was approved in december 2017 the current authorized repurchase program has no expiration date 

dividends paid to shareholders 

ppg has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899 and 2018 marked the 47th consecutive year of increased annual pershare dividend payments to shareholders the company raised its pershare quarterly dividend by 7 to 048 per share paid in september 2018 

debt issued and repaid 





the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 52  at december 31 2018 up from 43  in 2017 

credit agreements and lines of credit 

in december 2015 ppg entered into a fiveyear credit agreement the “credit agreement” with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in note 9  “ borrowings and lines of credit ” under item 8 of this form 10k the credit agreement provides for a 18 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the credit agreement will terminate on december 18 2020 during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 there were no borrowings outstanding 

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company maintains access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time which may provide an additional source of liquidity

2018 ppg annual report and form 10k 41 

contractual obligations 

we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments cash from operations and the company’s access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending acquisitions dividend payments debt service share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations are presented in the following table 



 other liquidity matters 

at december 31 2018 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was 182 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 9  “ borrowings and lines of credit ” under item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” and note 12  “ income taxes ” under item 8 of this form 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has 

42  2018 ppg annual report and 10k 

established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 13  “ employee benefit plans ” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

business combinations 

in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities 

the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows for more information on these matters see note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

comparing exchange rates from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 the us dollar strengthened against all other major currencies associated with countries in which ppg operates most notably the australian dollar british pound chinese yuan euro and south korean won as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2018 decreased by approximately 167 million from december 31 2017 comparing exchange rates from december 31 2016 to december 31 2017 the us dollar was weaker against the currencies in most countries in which ppg operates most notably the mexican peso british pound chinese yuan and euro as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2017 increased by approximately 231 million from december 31 2016 

comparing exchange rates during 2018 to those of 2017 in the countries in which ppg operates there was a favorable impact of approximately 21 million on full year 2018 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars comparing exchange rates during 2017 to those of 2016 in the countries in which ppg operates there was an unfavorable impact of approximately 7 million on full year 2017 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations 

2018 ppg annual report and form 10k 43 

in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to achieve selling price increases the ability to recover margins customer inventory levels our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in the markets we serve the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting including the identification of additional control deficiencies further expenditures related to our restatement the results of governmental actions relating to pending investigations the results of shareholder actions relating to the restatement of our financial statements and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 

consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things lower sales or income business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and was exposed to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 10  “ financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements ” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2018  and 2017  were generally designated as a hedge of ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 36 million and a net liability of 19 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european and canadian currencies and 20 for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  would have been 291 million and 255 million respectively 

in february 2018 ppg entered into us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 575 million  outstanding which had a fair value of a net asset of 35 million  as of december 31 2018  as of december 31 2017 ppg had us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 560 million  outstanding which had a fair value of a net asset of 2 million  a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by 57 million and 58 million  at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017 respectively 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 26 billion and 28 billion respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of 299 million and 314 million as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs in the first quarter of 2018 ppg entered into interest rate swaps which converted 525 million  of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt the fair value of these contracts was an asset of 8 million  as of december 31 2018  an increase in variable interest rates of 10 would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest expense by 10 million  over the term of the instrument a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg’s variable rate debt obligations and interest 

44  2018 ppg annual report and 10k 

expense for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 84 million and 61 million as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income before income taxes or cash flows 

equity price risk 

in prior years ppg entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to the trust see note 10  “ financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements ” and note 14  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” under item 8 of this form 10k in june 2016 ppg satisfied its funding obligation to the trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled at settlement the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of 258 million

 item 1 business 

ppg industries inc manufactures and distributes a broad range of paints coatings and specialty materials ppg was incorporated in pennsylvania in 1883 ppg’s vision is to be the world’s leading coatings company by consistently delivering highquality innovative and sustainable solutions that customers trust to protect and beautify their products and surroundings ppg’s business is comprised of two reportable business segments performance coatings and industrial coatings 

in september 2017 ppg completed the sale of its north american fiber glass business which represents the culmination of a multiyear strategic shift in the companys business portfolio resulting in the exit of all glass operations accordingly all historical information has been recast to present the glass segment as discontinued operations and assets held for sale refer to note 2 “acquisitions and divestitures” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information relating to this transaction 

performance coatings and industrial coatings 

ppg is a major global supplier of coatings the performance coatings and industrial coatings reportable business segments supply coatings and specialty materials to customers in a wide array of enduse markets including industrial equipment and components packaging material aircraft and marine equipment automotive original equipment “automotive oem” automotive refinish as well as for other industrial and consumer products ppg also serves commercial and residential new build and maintenance markets by supplying coatings to painting and maintenance contractors and directly to consumers for decoration and maintenance the coatings industry is highly competitive and consists of several large firms with global presence and many smaller firms serving local or regional markets ppg competes in its primary markets with the world’s largest coatings companies most of which have global operations and many smaller regional coatings companies

research and development 



technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the enduse markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management we have obtained government funding for a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate 

ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes in addition to the company’s centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 “properties” of this form 10k operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses and sand and soda ash for the specialty coatings and materials business coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide comprise between 70 and 80 of the company’s cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy while prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas 

the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations 

our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption have been successful to date and are expected to continue titanium dioxide is a raw material widely used in the paint and coatings industry as a pigment to provide hiding durability and whiteness characteristics ppg purchases both sulfategrade and chloridegrade titanium dioxide from suppliers for use in coatings formulations the company has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide as well as to minimize ppg’s use of this raw material ppg possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment ppg intends to continue to leverage this technology and intends to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations joint ventures and licensing arrangements with other interested parties 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the eu and many other countries including china canada the united states us and korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

given the recent volatility in certain energybased input costs and foreign currencies the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2018 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing however ppg currently expects overall coatings raw material costs to increase a midsingledigit percentage in the first half of 2018 with impacts varied by region and commodity further given the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are sizable as are wages and benefits but to a lesser degree ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials 

12  2017 ppg annual report and 10k 

driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates government regulation and global supply and demand factors in aggregate average raw material cost inflation rose by a midsingledigit percentage in 2017 versus 2016 driven mostly by supply related factors including an unusually high number of supplier force majeure events in europe chinese environmental regulation enforcement and severe hurricanes in the us in addition oil prices moved much higher in the second half of 2017 also contributing to raw material inflation 

patents 



ppg considers patent protection to be important however the company’s operating segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents 

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on ppg’s total net sales and income from continuing operations as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2017 favorable foreign currency translation increased net sales by approximately 55 million and decreased income from continuing operations by 7 million 

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st  are summarized below 



refer to note 19 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppg’s property plant and equipment and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales 

seasonality 

ppg’s income from continuing operations has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the us canada and europe the latin america paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter these cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher cash from operating activities 

employee relations 

the average number of people employed worldwide by ppg during 2017 was about 47200 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2017 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s results of operations overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees   

environmental matters 

ppg is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals our sustainability efforts are led by the technology and environment committee of our board of directors and our sustainability committee which is comprised of members of ppg’s senior management team the sustainability committee establishes 

2017 ppg annual report and form 10k 13 

policies programs procedures and goals to address sustainability in our business practices including resource management climate change innovation communications purchasing manufacturing and employee wellness 

our dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability once again in 2017 we increased the percent of our sales from sustainable products we are marketing an evergrowing variety of products and services that provide environmental safety and other benefits to our customers our products contribute to lighter more fuelefficient vehicles airplanes and ships and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption conserve water and reduce waste these products include a compact automotive paint process that saves energy and reduces water usage sustainable waterborne coatings formulations lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft coatings that cool surfaces and solutions for autonomous and batterypowered vehicles 

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible while ppg has operations in many countries a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary carbon disclosure project 

ppg participates in both the us department of energy better buildings® better plants® program formerly the save energy now® leadership program and the environmental protection agency energy star® industrial partnership program both reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity these programs include developing and implementing energy management processes and setting energy savings targets while providing a suite of educational training and technical resources to help meet those targets recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area 

our commitment to sustainability continues to yield tangible results in 2017 we again made significant progress reducing our energy intensity greenhouse gas emissions intensity water usage intensity and waste intensity more information about ppg’s sustainability values efforts goals and data and our community and employee engagement programs can be found in our sustainability report and on our sustainability website at httpsustainabilityppgcom and on the carbon disclosure project’s website at wwwcdpnet 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 126 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 24 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 258 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 100 million to 200 million these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites none of which are individually significant the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 



it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2018 will be in the range of 10 million to 20 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of paints coatings and specialty materials we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide comprise between 70 and 80 of the company’s cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

while not our customary practice we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins may be lower 

most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy 

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

refer to item 1 “raw materials and energy” of this form 10k for a discussion of the current year trends and outlook in raw material and energy costs 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during 2017 economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by enduse market ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities 

refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k for discussion of the economic conditions in 2017 and our outlook on certain economic conditions in 2018 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous waste the investigation and remediation 

2017 ppg annual report and form 10k 15 

of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and regulate various health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as described in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties the cost of which is substantial in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 100 million to 200 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including those described in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against major currencies could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in us dollars in 2017 changes in the us dollar versus our mix of currencies had a favorable impact on full year net sales and an unfavorable impact on income before income taxes from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars of approximately 55 million and 7 million respectively 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations as well as interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them 

new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and 

16  2017 ppg annual report and 10k 

regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our operations outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2017 by products sold outside the us was approximately 62  

changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to various taxes in both the us and nonus jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation in december 2017 the us enacted the us tax cuts and job act while the company has made a preliminary assessment of the new legislation’s impact on ppg us regulatory agencies will be issuing further regulations and clarifying interpretations over the next year which could alter the company’s conclusions regarding the impact of the new law further ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities if our effective income tax rate was to increase our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if future audits find that additional taxes are due we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations 

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce our ability to supply products reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

part of the company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions over the last decade we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 

 these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

2017 ppg annual report and form 10k 17 

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs 

we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and selfdriving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings in addition through the introduction of new technologies new business models or new methods of travel such as ridesharing the number of automotive oem newbuilds may decline potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings 

our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose a large regional or global customer or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate   

increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches this could lead to negative publicity theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information manufacture of defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims may relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers may contest coverage ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

the results of any future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

for many years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

in the past the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

in march 2016 the natural resource trustees for the calcasieu river estuary the united states department of the interior acting through the united states fish and wildlife service the national oceanic and atmospheric administration of the united states department of commerce the louisiana department of environmental quality and the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries reached an agreement in principle with ppg and two other potentially responsible parties to resolve the trustees’ claims for natural resource damages alleged to have been caused by the release of hazardous substances into the estuary in the fourth quarter of 2017 ppg signed a consent decree prepared by the us department of justice for settlement of potential natural resource damage claims at the calcasieu river estuary ppg’s share of this settlement is 36 million payment of ppg’s share of the settlement is required to be made into an escrow account within 30 days of filing the agreement with the court and is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2018

pension settlements 

during 2017 ppg made lumpsum payments to certain retirees who had participated in ppgs us qualified and nonqualified pension plans totaling approximately 127 million as the lumpsum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 service and interest costs for the affected plans ppg remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of these plans in the period payments were made and recorded settlement charges totaling 60 million 38 million aftertax during 2017

other charges 

other charges in 2017 were lower than 2016 due to the absence of environmental charges and certain asset writedowns in 2016 other charges were higher than in 2015 due to environmental charges of 82 million these charges were principally for environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey 

other income 

other income was higher in 2017 than in 2016 primarily due to the gain from the sale of the mexican plaka business of 25 million other income in 2016 was higher than in 2015 due to gains totaling 46 million resulting from the sale of a ppg legacy us automotive glass and services business and a us business affiliate higher equity earnings from a 2017 acquisition of a 40 interest in a joint venture and was partially offset by the absence of certain business transactionrelated gains 

effective tax rate and earnings per diluted share continuing operations 



the effective tax rate for the yearended december 31 2017  was 307  and increased 31 from the prior year primarily due to recording the net charge triggered by the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act this charge is approximately 37 million higher than the net charge included in ppg’s fourth quarter earnings release and form 8k furnished on january 18 2018 primarily due to new irs regulations issued and refinements of management estimates 

as reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2017  increased yearoveryear primarily due to the absence of the pension settlement charge of 616 million aftertax recorded in 2016 refer to the regulation g reconciliations  results of operations for additional information the company’s earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share both benefited from the 74 million 107 million and 70 million shares of stock repurchased in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

regulation g reconciliations  results of operations 

ppg industries believes investors’ understanding of the company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for certain charges ppg’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with us gaap in addition adjusted net income earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies

looking ahead 

in the first quarter 2018 we expect sales volumes in the architectural coatings  americas and asia pacific business to be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter 2017 in addition overall volume trends by customer channel are anticipated to be consistent with the fourth quarter 2017 the ppg timeless® product launched in certain home depot® stores in 2017 is projected to continue to meet our sales targets and is being expanded to more locations during 2018 we also anticipate additional growthrelated spending of up to 5 million in the first quarter to support the continued momentum in the region the volume growth trend for architectural coatings  emea is expected to improve modestly in the first quarter 2018 with results remaining uneven by country we expect continued high enduse demand in our automotive refinish coatings business as customers continue to adopt ppg’s industry leading technologies in aerospace coatings we anticipate continued improvement in industry demand growth the protective and marine coatings business is expected to perform inline with the market in the first quarter 2018 

we expect raw material costs to remain elevated in the firstquarter 2018 at similar levels experienced in the fourth quarter further selling price increases in 2018 will be needed to offset more recent raw material inflation there will be no material benefit from acquisitionrelated sales in the segment and based on midjanuary exchange rates foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018 

due to the timing of the easter holiday there is one fewer ship day in the firstquarter 2018 compared to firstquarter 2017 which is expected to unfavorably impact global architectural coatings sales volumes by about 20 million to 25 million in net sales this unfavorable impact will reverse in the second quarter

looking ahead 

in the first quarter of 2018 we expect global automotive industry production growth to be about 1 led by europe and mexico in china automotive production is expected to modestly decrease in the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the expiration of a small engine subsidy that had been in effect the past several years we anticipate solid general industrial demand growth trends to continue in aggregate but remain mixed by geography and enduse market ppg’s market outperformance is expected to continue in our packaging coatings business we anticipate volume growth will continue due to the ongoing industry conversion to bpa nonintent interior can coatings with ppg’s yearoveryear growth rates continuing at an above market level in 2018 we expect acquisitionrelated sales to add approximately 30 million to first quarter 2018 segment sales and based on midjanuary exchange rates foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018 

segment margin recovery continues to be a priority for 2018 based on recent raw material inflation segment margin recovery is expected to continue through the first half of 2018 all businesses in the segment have made progress with selling price initiatives and additional price increases have been announced for early 2018 also efforts to reduce costs remain a key focus in 2018 

review and outlook 

during 2017 economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by enduse market ppg’s aggregate organic sales grew 15 versus the prior year and were higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2017 acquisitionrelated sales from two acquisitions completed in 2016 and the four completed in 2017 contributed over 1 to net sales growth yearoveryear foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales yearoveryear favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of 2017 slightly offset unfavorable impacts during the first half of the year raw material inflation rose by a midsingledigit percentage driven mostly by supply related factors including an unusual high number of supplier force majeure events in europe government mandated production curtailments in china to help improve pollution and severe hurricanes in the us in addition oil prices moved sharply higher in the second half of the year also contributing to raw material inflation 

us and canada 

during 2017 the pace of economic activity improved in the us and canada region versus the prior year with higher industrial production despite lower automotive industry builds demand in the residential and commercial construction markets were modestly higher in 2017 compared to 2016 new home starts advanced about 2 in 2017 versus approximately 6 in 2016 residential remodeling declined 1 in 2017 versus 2016 while commercial construction was flat compared to 7 growth in 2016 market demand for architectural paint shifted more to trade paint as us unemployment continued to decline demand in the overall us diy paint market remained soft throughout the year ppg’s architectural coatings performance in the us followed market trends with solid improvement in companyowned same store sales throughout the year the automotive refinish coatings business benefited from higher miles driven and more congestion on the roads due to lower unemployment ppg’s packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry enduse market growth driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of ppg’s new interior can coatings technologies similar to 2016 ppg’s automotive oem coatings business lagged industry demand levels due to a customerdriven marketshare shift away from ppg that was offset in other regions of the world the us and canada region remained ppg’s largest representing approximately 43 of 2017 sales although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year 

europe middle east and africa 

european economic activity improved in 2017 despite continued regional uncertainty over the united kingdom’s exit from the european union overall gdp and industrial production improved in the region regional demand continued to be mixed by country and enduse market demand for ppg’s products in several enduse markets drove the regional growth rate including above market performance in automotive oem coatings aerospace coatings and specialty coatings and materials ppg’s architectural coatings  emea business sales volumes decreased yearoveryear driven by soft market demand in france and more competitive pressures in northern and eastern europe 

emea represented approximately 30 of ppg’s 2017 sales similar to prior year levels regional coatings volumes remain approximately 13 below their prerecession levels in 2008 the modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region ppg expects continued volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand in the second half of the year the euro appreciated approximately 5 against the us dollar the british pound recovered some of its 2016 declines versus the us dollar gaining about 10 from the start of 2017 

30  2017 ppg annual report and 10k 

asia pacific and latin america 

the emerging regional markets of asia pacific and latin america represented 27 of ppg’s 2017 sales in aggregate 200 basis points higher than the prior year 

asia remained the largest emerging region with sales of approximately 25 billion led by china which continued as ppg’s second largest country by revenue sales volume growth in asia was led by the industrial coatings segment in part due to strong sales volume growth in general industrial and automotive oem these increases were partially offset by the continued demand decline in the marine shipbuilding industry 

overall demand in latin america improved yearoveryear with continued above market growth in mexico and central america economic conditions modestly improved in south america primarily led by brazil in mexico the ppgcomex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations and strong growth continued in the automotive industry due to the opening of new automotive assembly plants within the country in the past 18 months foreign currency translation turned favorable in the second half of the year principally the mexican peso and chinese yuan in central america the company continued to grow organically following a 2015 acquisition to expand its presence in the architectural enduse market 

regional outlook 

looking ahead to 2018 we expect to continue to operate in a more balanced global growth environment we anticipate the positive economic trends in 2017 to mostly continue we expect economic growth rates to remain consistent with 2017 for the us and canada europe and asia pacific regions and we expect the latin america region will increase its economic growth yearoveryear when compared to 2017 

we anticipate ppg’s us and canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and packaging coatings with flat automotive industry builds we expect growth in the housing and commercial construction markets to be better than 2017 

we expect growth rates in europe to stay at similar levels as 2017 but will remain mixed by subregion and country favorable enduse market trends are expected to continue particularly in automotive oem coatings as industry build growth rates are anticipated to remain positive market demand is expected to improve in the architectural coatings business there is greater risk to the economic environment in the uk as their exit from the european union progresses 

in asia pacific we expect continued industrial production growth in china as well as gains in southeast asia and india in china we see continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption the regional declines in marine coatings sales volumes were less severe in the second half of 2017 and we expect a moderate recovery in sales volumes starting in the second half of 2018 automotive build growth is expected to remain modestly positive 

in latin america we anticipate economic expansion will be led by brazil and that mexico’s economic conditions will modestly improve 

significant other factors 

during 2017 ppg finalized the divestiture of its north american fiber glass business this is a transformational milestone for the company as it completed the culmination of a multiyear strategic shift in the company’s business portfolio the pretax cash proceeds from the sale were approximately 540 million 

in december 2016 ppg initiated a 195 million global restructuring program with anticipated annual savings of approximately 125 million once fully implemented the expected cost savings are broadly spread across all regions and all business units the company achieved approximately 50 million of savings in 2017 and expects to achieve the full annualized target of 125 million by 2019 ppg will continue to aggressively manage the company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace 

raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates and global supply and demand factors in aggregate average raw material costs were higher in 2017 versus 2016 due to supplier force majeure natural disasters and environmental regulation enforcement ppg currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a midsingledigit percentage in the first half of 2018 with impacts varied by region and commodity 

in 2017 aggregate selling prices were modestly higher yearoveryear reflecting the company’s efforts to offset higher raw material costs we expect to see further benefits from selling price actions taken in 2017 and other actions planned in 2018 to recover profit contribution margins the company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2018 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices to compensate for increases in raw material costs 

2017 ppg annual report and form 10k 31 

pension and postretirement benefit costs excluding settlements curtailments and special termination benefits totaled approximately 50 million in 2017 down approximately 70 million from 2016 in 2018 we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to decrease by approximately 15 million to 20 million due to strong 2017 asset performance improving the expected return on assets component of net periodic benefit cost as well as certain us plan changes made in 2017 

ppg contributed 54 million to its us defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and an additional 25 million in january 2018 in 2017 the company made contributions aggregating 33 million to its nonus defined benefit pension plans in 2018 mandatory contributions to ppg’s nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between 20 million and 30 million 

in 2017 unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half was completely offset by favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year based on midjanuary 2018 exchange rates the company expects yearoveryear favorable foreign currency translation to increase 2018 sales by 250 million to 300 million and 2018 income before income taxes by 25 million to 30 million we expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2018 due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2018 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from the guidance provided above the company generally purchases raw materials incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction costs 

with the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the company’s 2018 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 230 and 240 this range represents the company’s best estimate including the new legislation however our estimate is subject to revision as the company completes its assessment of the new law and as additional regulations and interpretations are issued other factors may affect the expected 2018 effective tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year including changes to various statutory tax rates and regulations around the world 

over the past four years the company used 34 billion of cash to repurchase about 33 million shares of ppg stock including over 800 million in 2017 the company ended the year with approximately 36 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorizations during 2017 the company deployed approximately 325 million for acquisitions and 434 million for dividends ppg increased its pershare dividend in july 2017 marking the 46th annual increase and the 118th consecutive year of dividend payments the company is committed to deploying a minimum of 24 billion of cash during 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated commitment to deploy 35 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined in 2017 ppg deployed 11 million for acquisitions and share repurchases 

ppg ended 2017 with approximately 15 billion in cash and shortterm investments the company expects continued strong cash generation in 2018

accounting standards to be adopted in future years 

note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to december 31 2017  but are not effective until a future date 

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits 

as discussed in item 3 and note 13 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

32  2017 ppg annual report and 10k 

the company continues to analyze assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppg’s former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city nj and associated sites “new jersey chrome” information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the new jersey department of environmental protection in 2021 

there are multiple future events yet to occur including further remedy selection and design remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey chrome sites final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted 

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements to fund our capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



cash from operating activities  continuing operations 



2017 vs 2016 

the 338 million increase in cash from operating activities  continuing operations was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the pittsburgh corning asbestos trust the “trust” lower defined benefit pension contributions lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital 

2016 vs 2015 

the 541 million decrease in cash from operating activities  continuing operations was primarily due to the aftertax funding of the trust partially offset by lower working capital and lower defined benefit pension contributions 

operating working capital 

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 receivables from customers net of allowance for doubtful accounts 2 inventories and 3 trade liabilities see note 3 “working capital detail” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses

cash used for investing activities  continuing operations 



2017 vs 2016 

the 535 million decrease in cash used for investing activities  continuing operations was primarily due to the absence of the prior year proceeds from the sale of the flat glass business european fiber glass business and two asian joint ventures as well as lower capital expenditures including business acquisitions partially offset by the current year proceeds from the sale of the north american fiber glass business 

2016 vs 2015

cash used for financing activities  continuing operations 



2017 vs 2016 

the 744 million increase in cash used for financing activities  continuing operations was primarily due to repayment of long term debt and higher dividends in 2017 partially offset by issuance of long term debt in 2016 and lower net purchases of treasury stock yearoveryear 

2016 vs 2015 

the 398 million increase in cash used for financing activities  continuing operations was primarily due to higher dividends in 2016 higher net purchases of treasury stock yearoveryear lower net issuance of long term debt in 2016 partially offset by lower taxes withheld for sharebased payments

 other liquidity matters 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” which among other things lowered the us corporate statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 eliminated certain deductible items and added other deductible items for corporations imposed a tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings and eliminated us taxes on most future foreign earnings in december 2017 the company recorded a net tax charge of 134 million related to the act the net charge consists of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings of approximately 250 million and a charge of approximately 125 million related to the remeasurement of ppg’s us deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new enacted statutory rate these charges were partially offset by a benefit from the reversal of an existing deferred tax liability on repatriated foreign earnings of approximately 150 million and a benefit resulting from ppg’s decision to accelerate recognition of certain us tax attributes during the fourth quarter 

this net charge is 37 million higher than the net charge included in ppg’s fourth quarter earnings release and form 8k furnished on january 18 2018 primarily due to new irs regulations issued and refinements of management estimates the net charge recorded as a provisional amount as of december 31 2017 represents the company’s best estimate using information available as of february 1 2018 the company anticipates us regulatory agencies will issue further regulations during 2018 which may alter this estimate the company is still evaluating among other things its position with respect to permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings overseas and other related outside basis difference considerations and the amount of tax owed on unrepatriated earnings by subsidiaries the company believes its remeasurement of the us deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 us 

36  2017 ppg annual report and 10k 

income tax return which are not anticipated to be material and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts recorded due to the enactment of the act the company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 us income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018 

the tax owed by ppg on its unrepatriated foreign earnings is payable over eight years and is subject to a prescriptive calculation to determine the portion payable in 2018 and beyond ppg’s current estimate using this prescriptive method indicates its tax payable will be increased by approximately 1 million to 3 million per year through 2025 as such the portion of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings not payable within the next 12 months is presented within “other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet 

the company currently expects its 2018 ongoing effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 23 to 24 

at december 31 2017 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was 163 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8 “borrowings and lines of credit” under item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 11 “income taxes” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 12 “employee benefit plans” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

business combinations 

in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in 

2017 ppg annual report and form 10k 37 

determining the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows for more information on these matters see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

comparing exchange rates from december 31 2016 to december 31 2017 the us dollar weakened against the currencies in most countries in which ppg operates most notably the mexican peso british pound chinese yuan and euro as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2017 increased by approximately 231 million from december 31 2016 

comparing exchange rates from december 31 2015 to december 31 2016 the us dollar strengthened against the currencies in most countries in which ppg operates most notably the mexican peso british pound chinese yuan and euro as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2016 decreased by approximately 465 million from december 31 2015 

comparing exchange rates during 2017 to those of 2016 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was stronger overall which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 7 million on full year 2017 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars 

comparing exchange rates during 2016 to those of 2015 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was stronger overall which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 70 million on full year 2016 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include the impacts of the natural disasters in mexico puerto rico and the us and their length and severity any currently unanticipated future impacts from the natural disasters global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to increase selling price the ability to recover margins our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in the markets we serve the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 

consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

38  2017 ppg annual report and 10k 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things lower sales or income business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and was exposed to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 9 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2017  and 2016  were generally designated as a hedge of ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 19 million and a net asset of 16 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european and canadian currencies and 20 for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  would have been 255 million and 105 million respectively 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  ppg had us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 560 million outstanding as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 2 million and 65 million respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by 58 million and by 54 million at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 28 billion and 31 billion respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of 314 million and 344 million as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 61 million and 65 million as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income from continuing operations or cash flows 

equity price risk 

in prior years ppg entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to the trust see note 9 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k in june 2016 ppg satisfied its funding obligation to the trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled at settlement the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of 258 million

strategic acquisitions 

since the filing of our 2015 form 10k the performance coatings and industrial coatings segments announced and completed several strategic acquisitions as follows 

performance coatings 

on january 20 2017 ppg acquired certain assets of automotive refinish coatings company futian xinshi futian based in the guangdong province of china futian distributes its products in china through a network of more than 200 distributors futian had sales of approximately 15 million in 2016

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses sand and soda ash for the specialty coatings and materials business and sand and clay in the north american 

10  2016 ppg annual report and form 10k 

fiber glass business coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide comprise between 70 and 80 of the company’s cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy while prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas 

the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations 

our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption have been successful to date and are expected to continue titanium dioxide is a raw material widely used in the paint and coatings industry as a pigment to provide hiding durability and whiteness characteristics ppg purchases both sulfategrade and chloridegrade titanium dioxide from suppliers for use in coatings formulations the company has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide as well as to minimize ppg’s use of this raw material ppg possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment ppg intends to continue to leverage this technology and intends to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations joint ventures and licensing arrangements with other interested parties 

ppg signed a license agreement with henan billions chemicals co ltd “billions” under which ppg has licensed certain chloridebased titanium dioxide technologies for use at billions’ titanium dioxide refinement facilities in china in addition ppg has signed longterm purchase agreements for chloridegrade and sulfategrade titanium dioxide with billions in late 2015 ppg began using chloridegrade titanium dioxide produced by billions using ppg’s licensed chloridebased technology ppg’s usage of billions’ chloridegrade titanium dioxide increased in 2016 ppg is using the chloridegrade titanium dioxide to produce standard grades of coatings products under the license agreement billions has the right to sell chloridebased titanium dioxide to other parties 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

 

changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the eu and many other countries including china canada the united states and korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

given the recent volatility in certain energybased input costs and foreign currencies the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2017 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing however ppg currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase modestly in 2017 with impacts varied by region and commodity further given the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are sizable as are wages and benefits but to a lesser degree in aggregate raw material feedstock prices in 2016 were lower including oilrelated products although some products experienced price inflation late in the year since oil is traded in us dollars globally the strengthening of the dollar against a wide variety of foreign currencies reduced some of the oilrelated benefits in certain regions and in certain cases resulted in inflationary raw material prices 

research and development 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 487 million 494 million and 499 million during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively and totaled approximately 3 of annual sales in each year we have obtained government funding for a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate 

 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes in addition to the company’s centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 of this form 10k operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the enduse markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management 

  patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important however the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg earned 15 million 20 million and 29 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

2016 ppg annual report and form 10k 11 

backlog 

 in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on ppg’s total net sales and income from continuing operations as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2016 unfavorable foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 400 million 

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st  are summarized below 



refer to note 19 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppg’s property plant and equipment and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales 

seasonality 

ppg’s income from continuing operations has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the us and canada and europe the latin america paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter these higher activity levels result in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash from operating activities 

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2016 was about 47000 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2016 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s results of operations overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

 

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 126 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 24 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 285 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 100 million to 200 million these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites none of which are individually significant the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 

capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 18 million 15 million and 14 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2017 will be in the range of 10 million to 20 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs 

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible while ppg has operations in many countries a substantial portion of ppg’s 

12  2016 ppg annual report and form 10k 

ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary carbon disclosure project 

since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels and the purchase of electricity ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation for the three year period ended december 31 2016 including the flat glass facilities divested october 1 2016 energy consumption intensity was reduced by 30 and ghg emission generation intensity was reduced by 22 

ppg participates in both the us department of energy better buildings® better plants® program formerly the save energy now® leadership program and the environmental protection agency energy star® industrial partnership program both reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity these programs include developing and implementing energy management processes and setting energy savings targets while providing a suite of educational training and technical resources to help meet those targets recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings specialty materials and fiber glass products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations 

 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide comprise between 70 and 80 of the company’s cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

while not our customary practice we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins may be lower 

most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world adding onsite resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy 

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during 2016 overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities 

refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k for discussion of the economic conditions in 2016 and our outlook on certain economic conditions in 2017 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the 

2016 ppg annual report and form 10k 13 

handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous waste the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and regulate various health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as described in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties the cost of which is substantial in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 100 million to 200 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including those described in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign 

 

currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in us dollars in 2016 this us dollar strengthening had an unfavorable impact on full year net sales and income before income taxes from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars of approximately 400 million and 70 million respectively 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them 

new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our operations outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2016 by products sold outside the us was approximately 60  

changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to various taxes in both the us and nonus jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change our future 

14  2016 ppg annual report and form 10k 

effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation recent developments including potential us tax reform discussions the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities if our effective income tax rate was to increase our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if future audits find that additional taxes are due we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities financial condition and results of operations 

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce our ability to supply products reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

part of the company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 



 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash from operating activities or financial condition 

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs 

we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and selfdriving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings in addition through the introduction of new technologies new business models or new methods of travel such as ridesharing the number of automotive oem newbuilds may decline potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings 

our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose a large regional or global customer or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate   

increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches this could lead to negative publicity theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information manufacture of defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims may relate to contract patent environmental product liability asbestos exposure antitrust employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers may contest coverage ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

the results of any future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized

effective tax rate and earnings per diluted share continuing operations 



the effective tax rate for the yearended december 31 2016 was 291 and increased 53 from the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of the tax effects of significant transactions during the year including the tax effects of funding the pittsburgh corning asbestos trust 

as reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2016 declined yearoveryear from 2015 primarily due to significant pension settlement charges and other charges for items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur or that are not attributable to our primary operations refer to the regulation g reconciliations  results of operations for additional information the company’s earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share both benefited from the 107 million 70 million and 76 million shares of stock repurchased in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

regulation g reconciliations  results of operations 

ppg industries believes investors’ understanding of the company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for certain charges ppg’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with us gaap in addition adjusted net income earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies 

income before income taxes is reconciled to adjusted income before income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations is reconciled to the adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations and net income attributable to ppg and earnings per share – assuming dilution attributable to ppg are reconciled to adjusted net income attributable to ppg and adjusted earnings per share – assuming dilution below

looking ahead 

in the first quarter of 2017 we expect a similar industry demand environment and consistent ppg sales sequentially due to normal business seasonality yearoveryear comparisons in 2017 will continue to reflect the absence of sales and income from the divested european fiber glass business and two asian fiber glass joint ventures until their oneyear anniversaries in the fourth quarter 2017 we do not anticipate any significant impact from foreign currency translation 

2016 ppg annual report and form 10k 25 

review and outlook 

during 2016 economic conditions remained mixed by geography and enduse market despite a subdued and uneven economic backdrop ppg’s aggregate sales volumes grew modestly versus the prior year acquisitionrelated sales from the six acquisitions completed in 2015 and the two completed in 2016 contributed to net sales growth yearoveryear these net sales increases were offset by significant unfavorable foreign currency translation as the us dollar strengthened against most foreign currencies throughout the year primarily the mexican peso the british pound and the chinese yuan 

us and canada 

during 2016 the pace of economic activity remained mixed by enduse market in the us and canada region with contraction in industrial production including lower automotive industry builds versus prior year coupled with growth in other enduse markets demand increased in the residential and commercial construction markets albeit at a slower pace versus 2015 new home starts advanced about 5 in 2016 versus approximately 10 in 2015 with similar growth rate declines experienced in residential remodeling and commercial construction ppg’s packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry enduse market growth due to continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of ppg’s new interior can coatings technologies the refinish coatings business benefited from higher miles driven aided by continued low gasoline prices ppg’s automotive oem business lagged industry demand levels due to a customerdriven marketshare shift away from ppg that was offset in other regions of the world the us and canada region remained ppg’s largest representing approximately 45 of 2016 sales consistent with the prior year 

emea 

european economic activity continued to strengthen modestly in 2016 despite regional uncertainty due to the united kingdom’s vote to exit the european union overall gdp and industrial production improved modestly in the region but at a slower pace versus 2015 regional demand continued to be mixed by country and enduse market ppg experienced sales volume growth in each 2016 quarter with the first half of the year growing faster than the second half due in part to a comparison to more robust growth in the second half of 2015 demand for ppg’s products in several enduse markets drove the regional growth rate including above market performance in automotive oem and general industrial coatings 

europe middle east africa emea remains a large region for ppg representing approximately 30 of ppg’s 2016 sales similar to prior year levels regional coatings volumes remain approximately 16 below their prerecession levels in 2008 the modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region ppg expects continued volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand the euro and other regional currencies were relatively stable throughout the first half of 2016 in the second half of the year the british pound declined meaningfully versus the us dollar due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the vote to exit the european union in addition the euro 

 

experienced a moderate decline versus the us dollar after the american presidential election in november 

asia pacific and latin america 

the emerging regional markets of asia pacific and latin america represented 25 of ppg’s 2016 sales in aggregate in line with the prior year which increased from 22 in 2014 primarily due to the comex acquisition in mexico 

asia remained the largest emerging region with sales of approximately 24 billion led by china which continued as ppg’s second largest country by revenue sales volume growth in asia was led by the industrial coatings segment in part due to strong automotive industry build growth general industrial growth and continued adoption of ppg’s interior can coatings technologies within the packaging industry these increases were partially offset by the continued demand decline in the marine shipbuilding industry 

overall demand in latin america remained subdued with continued above market growth in mexico and central america offset by slow overall demand growth in south america primarily brazil in mexico the ppgcomex business added over 200 new retail outlets and automotive industry production accelerated in the second half of the year due to the opening of new automotive assembly plants within the country sales volumes continued to increase yearoveryear despite significant unfavorable foreign currency translation principally from the mexican peso in central america the company continued to grow organically following a 2015 acquisition to expand its presence in the architectural enduse market

looking ahead to 2017 we expect to continue to operate in an evolving macroeconomic and regulatory environment we anticipate improved momentum in overall global economic growth including gradually higher growth rates in developed regions and continuing but uneven growth in emerging regions we expect economic growth rates to improve in the us and canada and latin america regions led by underlying improvements in gdp and industrial production we anticipate ppg’s us and canada regional growth will be led by industrial and packaging coatings partially offset by a decline in automotive industry builds we continue to expect growth in the housing and commercial construction markets but at a slower pace than 2016 in latin america we anticipate economic expansion will be led by mexico albeit at a slower pace than 2016 and for south america to return to flat or slightly positive yearoveryear growth following a multiyear contraction in economic output 

we expect growth rates to expand versus prior year in emea and asia pacific in europe economic growth rates will remain mixed by subregion and country favorable enduse market trends are expected to continue particularly in automotive oem coatings as industry build growth rates are anticipated to remain positive in asia pacific we expect continued industrial production growth in china as well as gains in southeast asia and india automotive build growth is expected to remain positive but at a more modest growth rate versus 2016

significant other factors 

during 2016 ppg finalized the divestiture of its flat glass and european fiber glass businesses as well as the sale of other businesses and business affiliates the company received total cash proceeds of approximately 11 billion from these transactions 

in december 2016 ppg initiated a 197 million global restructuring program with anticipated annual savings of approximately 125 million once fully implemented the expected cost savings are broadly spread across all regions and all business units the company expects to achieve 40 million to 50 million in savings in 2017 with the remainder of the projected annual savings to be substantially realized by yearend 2018 the company finalized all actions related to its 2015 restructuring program achieving approximately 60 million of incremental savings during 2016 ppg will continue to aggressively manage the company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace 

raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories global industry activity levels foreign currency exchange rates and global supply and demand factors in aggregate average raw material costs were lower in 2016 versus 2015 with certain raw materials experiencing price inflation late in the year these savings were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency transaction costs as some key raw materials are traded in us dollars globally ppg currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase modestly in 2017 with impacts varied by region and commodity 

pension and postretirement benefit costs excluding settlements curtailments and special termination benefits were 120 million in 2016 down approximately 55 million from 2015 in 2017 we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to decrease by approximately 15 million to 20 million due to us postretirement medical plan design changes made in 2016 

during 2016 the company took significant steps to reduce financial risk and settle longterm obligations first ppg contributed approximately 800 million pretax to complete its longstanding involvement in the pittsburgh corning bankruptcy by fully funding its obligations to the pittsburgh corning asbestos settlement trust which included the prepayment of all future obligations at a 55 discount the company has no further obligations for the trust’s operation management or funding second ppg permanently transferred approximately 18 billion of its us and canadian pension obligations and assets to several highly rated insurance companies these actions are expected to reduce volatility in ppg’s financial statements related to changes in pension discount rates and assumed participant mortality as a result of these changes ppg contributed 146 million to its us pension plans in the second half of 2016 and 29 million in january 2017 in 2016 the company made contributions aggregating 204 million to its us and nonus pension plans in 2017 mandatory 

 

contributions to ppg’s nonus pension plans are expected to be between 20 million and 30 million 

in 2016 aggregate selling prices were nearly flat yearoveryear reflecting lower raw material prices which were partly offset by increases in employeerelated costs selective pricing actions are planned for 2017 including announced price increases in architectural coatings companyowned stores in various parts of the world to reflect higher input costs on certain commodities experienced during 2016 in aggregate the company expects selling prices to remain generally flat in 2017 the company will carefully monitor the price of oilbased raw materials as the price of oil rose modestly in the later part of 2016 and other significant coatings feedstock prices throughout the year and assess the need to increase selling prices to compensate for increases in raw material costs 

in 2016 unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced sales by approximately 400 million and pretax income by about 70 million as the us dollar strengthened against most foreign currencies throughout the year primarily the mexican peso british pound and chinese yuan based on midjanuary 2017 exchange rates the company expects yearoveryear unfavorable foreign currency translation to reduce 2017 sales by 375 million to 425 million and 2017 pretax income by about 70 million to 90 million these unfavorable impacts will be greater in the first half of 2017 as the us dollar strengthened significantly versus most foreign currencies in the second half of 2016 the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2017 net sales and pretax income could differ from the guidance the company generally purchases raw materials incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction costs 

the company expects interest expense net of interest income in 2017 to be approximately 5 million to 10 million higher than 2016 due to a 110 million increase in ppg’s outstanding debt obligations despite a lower overall interest rate on it’s aggregate debt portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016 ppg issued approximately €900 million of public notes at rates below 1 with terms ranging from three to nine years 

the company’s 2017 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 245 and 255 this is slightly higher than the equivalent rate in 2016 primarily due to a shift in the mix of earnings to jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates other factors may impact the expected 2017 effective tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year including changes to various statutory tax rates and regulations around the world 

over the past five years the company used 36 billion of cash to repurchase about 39 million shares of ppg stock including over 10 billion in 2016 the company ended the year with approximately 19 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization during 2016 the company deployed approximately 350 million for acquisitions and approximately 415 million for dividends ppg increased its annual pershare dividend by 11 in 2016 marking the 45th annual increase and the 117th consecutive year of dividend payments the company achieved the top end of its 2015 and 2016 cash deployment target for acquisitions and share

accounting standards adopted in 2016 

note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k describes the company’s recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

accounting standards to be adopted in future years 

note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to december 31 2016 but are not effective until a future date 

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits 

as discussed in item 3 and note 13 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

the company continues to analyze assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppg’s former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city nj and associated sites “new jersey chrome” information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the new jersey department of environmental protection no later than 2020 

 

there are multiple future events yet to occur including further remedy selection and design remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey chrome sites final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted 

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements to fund our capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders 

cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 

summary cash flow information  continuing operations 

cash from operating activities  continuing operations 

the decrease in cash from operating activities  continuing operations in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to fully funding ppg’s portion of the pittsburgh corning asbestos trust the “trust” in 2016 the slight increase in cash from continuing operating activities in 2015  compared to 2014  was driven by higher income from continuing operations largely offset by higher cash contributions to pension plans 

operating working capital 

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 receivables from customers net of allowance for doubtful accounts 2 inventories and 3 trade liabilities see note 3 “working capital detail” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses operating working capital at december 31 2016  and 2015  was   21 billion  and 23 billion  respectively 

28  2016 ppg annual report and form 10k

environmental cash expenditures 

cash outlays related to environmental remediation activities were 47 million  109 million and 165 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we expect cash outlays for environmental remediation activities in 2017 to be between 50 million and 70 million 

defined benefit pension plan contributions 

following the transfer of certain us retiree obligations and assets to third party insurers ppg contributed 146 million and 29 million to its us plans during 2016 and in january 2017 respectively some contributions to ppg’s nonus defined benefit pension plans in 2016 were required by local funding requirements ppg expects to make mandatory contributions to its nonus plans in the range of 20 million to 30 million in 2017 ppg may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and beyond 

asbestos settlement trust funding

obligation the company utilized cash on hand for the payments and this funding had no impact on ppg’s previously stated cashdeployment targets refer to note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 1 of this form 10q for additional information

30  2016 ppg annual report and form 10k 

contractual obligations 

we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments cash from operations and the company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending including acquisitions dividend payments debt service share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations are presented in the following table 



 other liquidity matters 

at december 31 2016 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was 103 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur 

the company had 53 billion of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as of december 31 2016 and 50 billion as of december 31 2015 these amounts relate to approximately 250 subsidiaries in more than 75 taxable jurisdictions over the past several years ppg has established deferred tax liabilities on specific undistributed earnings namely in connection with divestitures and the funding of the trust at december 31 2016 and 2015 the expected future tax cost to repatriate these foreign earnings which are not permanently reinvested totaled 189 million  and 158 million  respectively no significant deferred us income taxes have been   provided on the remaining 35 billion and 42 billion of ppg’s undistributed earnings as they are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so the company estimates repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as of 

 

december 31 2016 and 2015 would have resulted in a us tax cost of approximately 350 million  and 375 million  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8 “borrowings and lines of credit” under item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 11 “income taxes” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 12 “employee benefit plans” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

business combinations 

  in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using 

2016 ppg annual report and form 10k 31 

management estimates and negotiated amounts the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows for more information on these matters see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

comparing exchange rates from december 31 2015 to december 31 2016 and december 31 2014 to december 31 2015 the us dollar strengthened against the currencies in most countries in which ppg operates most notably the mexican peso british pound chinese yuan and euro as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2016 and 2015 decreased by approximately 465 million and 705 million respectively 

comparing exchange rates during 2016 to those of 2015 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was stronger overall which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 70 million on full year 2016 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars 

comparing exchange rates during 2015 to those of 2014 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was stronger overall which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 120 million on full year 2015 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into us dollars 

 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in the markets we serve ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 

consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things lower sales or earnings business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and was exposed to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 9 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2016  and 2015  were generally designated as a hedge of ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 16 million the potential reduction in ppg’s income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european and canadian currencies and 20 for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  would have been 105 million and 29 million respectively 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  ppg had us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 560 million outstanding as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 65 million and 41 million respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of this instrument by 54 million as of december 31 2016  and increasing the liability by 60 million at december 31 2015  

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 31 billion and 21 billion respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of 344 million and 242 million as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 65 million and 75 million as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income from continuing operations or cash flows 

equity price risk 

in prior years ppg entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to the trust see note 9 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k in june 2016 ppg satisfied its funding obligation to the trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled at settlement the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of 258 million

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings segments sand and soda ash for the specialty coatings and materials business and sand clay and soda ash in the glass segment coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide comprise between 70 and 80 of cost of goods sold excluding depreciation and amortization in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

energy is a significant production cost in the glass segment and our primary energy source is natural gas natural gas is expected to remain a competitive fuel source when compared to alternatives especially on a global basis we will continue to use competitive sourcing and consumption reduction initiatives to manage natural gas costs 

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy while prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas 

the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations 

our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption have been successful to date and are expected to continue 

 

titanium dioxide is a raw material widely used in the paint and coatings industry as a pigment to provide hiding durability and whiteness characteristics ppg purchases both sulfategrade and chloridegrade titanium dioxide from suppliers for use in coatings formulations the company has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide as well as to minimize ppg’s use of this raw material ppg possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment ppg intends to continue to leverage this technology and intends to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations joint ventures and licensing arrangements with other interested parties 

ppg signed a license agreement with henan billions chemicals co ltd “billions” under which ppg has licensed certain chloridebased titanium dioxide technologies for use at billions’ titanium dioxide refinement facilities in china in addition ppg has signed a longterm purchase agreement for titanium dioxide with billions in the fourth quarter of 2015 ppg began using chloridegrade titanium dioxide produced in commercial quantities by billions using ppg’s licensed chloridebased technology ppg is using the chloridegrade titanium dioxide to produce standard grades of coatings products billions may also elect to sell its chloridebased titanium dioxide to third parties 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the eu and many other countries including china canada the united states and korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

given the recent volatility in certain energybased input costs and foreign currencies the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2016 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing also given the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are sizable as are wages and benefits to a lesser degree in aggregate raw material feedstock prices in 2015 were lower including oilrelated products since oil is traded in us dollars globally the strengthening of the dollar against a wide variety of foreign currencies muted some of the oilrelated benefits in certain regions and in certain cases resulted in inflationary raw material prices 

2015 ppg annual report and form 10k 11 

research and development 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 505 million 509 million and 479 million during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively these costs totaled approximately 3 of annual sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we have obtained government funding for a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate 

 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes in addition to the company’s centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 of this form 10k operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the enduse markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management 

  patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important however the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg earned 39 million in 2015 50 million in 2014 and 48 million in 2013 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

backlog 

 in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on ppg’s total net sales and income from continuing operations as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st  are summarized below 



refer to note 19 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppg’s property plant and equipment and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales 

seasonality 

ppg’s income from continuing operations has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash flow from operations has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the us canada and europe the latin america paint season is strongest in the fourth quarter these higher activity levels result in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash flow 

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2015 was about 46600 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs legislation and practice in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2015 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 126 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 24 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

12  2015 ppg annual report and form 10k 

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 233 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 75 million to 200 million these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 

capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 15 million 14 million and 22 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2016 will be in the range of 25 million to 35 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs 

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible while ppg has operations in many countries a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary carbon disclosure project 

since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation for the three year period ended december 31 2015 energy consumption was reduced by 23 and ghg emission generation was reduced by 18 

ppg participates in both the us department of energy better buildings® better plants® program formerly the save energy now® leadership program and the environmental protection agency energy star® industrial partnership program both reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity these programs include developing and implementing energy management processes and setting energy savings targets while providing a suite of educational training and technical 

 

resources to help meet those targets recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings specialty materials and glass products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide comprise between 70 and 80 of cost of goods exclusive of depreciation and amortization sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

while not our customary practice we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins may be lower 

most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its 

2015 ppg annual report and form 10k 13 

aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy 

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during 2015 overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash flows 

refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k for discussion of the economic conditions in 2015 and our outlook on certain economic conditions in 2016 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous waste the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and regulate various health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as described in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties the cost of which is substantial in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 75 million to 200 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies could materially affect our financial results expressed in us dollars in 2015 this strengthening had an unfavorable impact on full year net sales and income before income taxes from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars of approximately 11 billion and 120 million respectively 

for many years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and the satisfaction of 

14  2015 ppg annual report and form 10k 

certain closing conditions we are working with the court and the parties to finalize the arrangement in the first half of the 2016 if the arrangement is not finalized the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them 

new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our operations outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2015 by products sold outside the us was approximately 58  

changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to various taxes in both the us and nonus jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may 

 

result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities if our effective income tax rate was to increase our cash flows financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if future audits find that additional taxes are due we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce our ability to supply products reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

part of the company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose a large regional or global customer or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate   

increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches this could lead to negative publicity theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information manufacture of defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims may relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and

contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

the results of any future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

for many years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed asbestos settlement arrangement see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

in the past the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

in december 2011 the united states environmental protection agency “epa” issued a finding of violation alleging that ppg’s delaware ohio facility violated certain leak detection and repair requirements of the federal clean air act ppg and the epa are engaged in discussions in an effort to try to resolve this matter with a negotiated consent decree as part of these settlement discussions the epa is currently seeking a civil penalty from ppg of approximately 397000 final resolution of these matters is subject to further negotiation between ppg and the epa however it is likely that the final penalty will exceed 100000 

in july 2013 the epa issued to ppg a notice of violation “nov” alleging that the company’s barberton ohio facility violated certain air emission regulatory requirements of the federal clean air act in february 2015 the epa issued a second nov to the company alleging that the company’s barberton facility had failed to submit certain information requested by the epa and that the facility exceeded certain air emission limits contained in the facility’s air emission permit ppg and the epa are engaged in discussions in an effort to try to resolve this matter with a negotiated consent decree as part of these settlement discussions the epa is currently seeking a civil penalty from ppg of approximately 137500 final resolution of these matters is subject to further negotiation between ppg and the epa however it is likely that the final penalty will exceed 100000

other costs and income 

interest expense net of interest income 

interest expense net of interest income decreased 51 million in 2015 versus the prior year largely as a result of a debt refinancing undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2014 

business restructuring 

in 2015 ppg approved a business restructuring program which includes actions necessary to achieve cost synergies related to recent acquisitions in addition the program aims to further align employee levels and production capacity in certain businesses and regions based on current product demand as well as reductions in various global administrative functions a pretax restructuring charge of 140 million was recorded of which about 85 represents employee severance and other cash charges ppg expects these restructuring actions will result in full year pretax savings of approximately 105 million by year 2017 including 2015 partial year savings of approximately 20 million refer to note 7 business restructuring in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

in 2013 the company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 98 million related to a restructuring plan focused on achieving cost synergies through improved productivity and efficiencies all actions associated with the 2013 restructuring program are completed

other charges in 2015 and 2013 were lower than 2014 due to the timing and amount of these pretax environmental charges 

other income 

in 2014 ppg recorded a 22 million pretax gain on the divestiture of a flat glass production facility and a 94 million pretax gain on ppgs share of the gain recognized from the sale of an equity affiliates business 

 

other income in 2015 and 2013 was lower than 2014 due to the absence of these benefits further in 2015 other income was reduced by an equity affiliate debt refinancing transaction charge of 11 million 

effective tax rate and earnings per share 



the effective tax rate for the yearended december 31 2015 was affected by a shift in ppgs global mix of earnings toward jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates due in part to recent acquisitions including comex 

earnings per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2015 grew consecutively from 2014 and 2013 the company benefited from the 115 million shares of stock repurchased in 2013 the 76 million shares of stock repurchased during 2014 and the 70 million shares repurchased in 2015 

in addition about 216 million shares were added to treasury stock as a result of the january 2013 exchange transaction that was part of the separation of ppg’s former commodity chemicals business 

on april 16 2015 the ppg board of directors approved a 2for1 split of the company’s common stock for all shareholders the record date for the split was the close of business on may 11 2015 and the additional shares were distributed on june 12 2015 each shareholder as of the date of record received one additional share of common stock for each share held historical per share and share data except for shares on the balance sheet in this form 10k give retroactive effect to the stock split these reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported net income total assets cash flows or shareholders’ equity

regulation g reconciliation  results from operations 

ppg industries believes investors’ understanding of the company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for nonrecurring charges ppg’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with us gaap in addition adjusted net income earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies 

income before income taxes is reconciled to adjusted income before income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations is reconciled to the adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations and net income attributable to ppg and earnings per share – assuming dilution attributable to ppg are reconciled to adjusted net income attributable to ppg and adjusted earnings per share – assuming dilution below

looking ahead 

in the first quarter of 2016 we expect recently completed acquisitions to add 25 million to 30 million to net sales we also expect sales volume growth to continue in the architectural coatings  emea business in the first quarter of 2016 although we expect results to vary by country in addition the protective and marine coatings business is expected to deliver modest yearoveryear volume growth in the first quarter 2016 for the aerospace coatings business we anticipate sales volume performance to be in line with industry rates as customer order patterns return to normal levels in our architectural coatings americas and asia pacific business we are implementing various initiatives in our north american do it yourself business consistent with ppgs multiyear rebranding strategy announced in 2015 these initiatives include investments in new product labeling and improved store displays along with associated growthoriented initiatives which will result in incremental costs of approximately 15 million additionally based on current exchange rates we expect foreign currency translation on segment sales and income to be less unfavorable sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and yearoveryear as the euro and other major currencies weakened during 2015

in the first quarter of 2016 we expect recently completed acquisitions to add between 80 million and 90 million to net sales we expect modest automotive industry production growth worldwide in the first quarter of 2016 with growth in all regions except south america for the packaging coatings business we expect a continued industry shift toward bpa nonintent bpani products on the inside of food and beverage cans globally resulting in sustained ppg sales volume growth in early 2016 overall we expect modest general industrial sales volume growth to continue but to likely remain varied by region and industrial subsector additionally based on current exchange rates we expect foreign currency translation on segment sales and income to be less unfavorable sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and yearoveryear as the euro and other major currencies weakened during 2015

looking ahead 

in the first quarter of 2016 we expect a relatively stable industry demand environment for the flat glass business with lower ppg sales due to the fresno facility maintenance outage the maintenance expenses associated with the fresno repair project are expected to be approximately 8 million we anticipate fiber glass demand to be in line with the prior year additionally based on current exchange rates we expect foreign currency translation on segment sales and income to be less unfavorable sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and yearoveryear as the euro and other major currencies weakened during 2015

review and outlook 

during 2015 overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies and across the various enduse markets ppg supplies despite the uneven overall market conditions ppg’s aggregate sales volumes grew about 1 in addition to the organic growth acquisitions led by comex contributed significantly to the company sales adding about 6 to net sales these net sales additions were offset by 7 unfavorable foreign currency translation as the us dollar strengthened versus most major foreign currencies 

the us and canada remained ppg’s largest region representing 46 of 2015 sales during 2015 industrial activity was mixed by enduse market and by country with modestly positive trends in the us and lower demand in canada largely due to lower commodity and energy prices certain consumerfacing industries like automotive oem continued to expand these gains were driven by lower unemployment rates and rising consumer disposable income partly related to lower energy prices 

in addition to overall market gains ppg’s leading products continued to gain broader market acceptance consistent with previous years ppg automotive oem coatings continued to outpace regional industry growth in packaging coatings ppg’s new interior can coatings contributed to abovemarket enduse growth rates and ppg’s waterborne refinish coatings continued to be a major factor in new customer adoption within the region 

construction spending in the region continued to recover in a measured manner building on the recovery in recent years us housing starts grew over 10 during the year and were supplemented by continued improvement in the residential remodeling market nonresidential construction demand recovered as well although the results were mixed across the different us regions although smaller in size canadian construction market demand declined as regional gross domestic product gdp in the country was negative for a large portion of the year reflecting the impact from falling global energy prices which is an important element of the canadian economy 

european economic activity continued to modestly strengthen and broaden throughout the year in general economic factors including gdp and industrial production improved within the region demand remained mixed by country as some european countries experienced relatively strong growth rates while others were flat or declined regional demand for ppg products also strengthened throughout the year with first quarter yearoveryear sales volumes growing one percent and performance steadily improving during the year ending with about 3 growth in the fourth quarter demand for ppg’s products in several enduse markets aided ppg’s overall regional growth rate including automotive oem and refinish coatings aerospace coatings and protective and marine coatings 

europe remains a very large region for ppg representing just under 30 of ppg’s 2015 sales down slightly versus the prior year due to the impact of lower currency exchange rates and the addition of acquisitionrelated sales in other ppg regions company coatings sales volumes in the region are still down about 17 or just under 900 million when compared to 2008 prerecession levels reflecting economic weakness in the years during and following the recession without a substantive recovery since from a currency perspective the euro and other 

 

currencies in the region weakened considerably against the us dollar resulting in unfavorable currency translation for the company 

the emerging market regions of asia and latin america represented 26 of ppg’s 2015 sales versus 22 in 2014 this expansion was primarily due to the comex acquisition that was completed in november 2014 in the aggregate emerging region economies continued to expand during 2015 but at a lower rate than the previous year within the emerging regions growth rates varied considerably by country ppg sales volume growth of 4 in asia was partly offset by a decline of less than 1 in latin america 

asia was the largest emerging region with sales of about 24 billion led by china which remained ppg’s second largest individual country from a sales perspective in 2015 the largest gains in asia were in the industrial coatings segment including the benefit of 5 industry growth in chinese automotive production offsetting these improvements was muted demand in several general industrial enduse markets including heavyduty equipment and constructionrelated metal products in addition to the industrial coatings gains protective and marine coatings aerospace coatings and other businesses experienced increased sales volumes 

demand in the latin american economies was bifurcated with economic growth continuing in mexico aided by increased industrial production this was partly offset by economic contraction in south america particularly in brazil due to high inflation and unemployment rates also weakening south american currencies versus the us dollar were unfavorable to ppg net sales 

looking ahead to 2016 we anticipate ppg volume growth rates to improve in each region and in aggregate versus the prior year we expect broadening growth to continue in europe including a continuation of demand growth in automotive oem and packaging coatings we expect moderate growth trends to remain in most enduse markets in the us with canada stabilizing at lower demand levels we anticipate emerging regions growth to remain mixed but for ppg to post solid aggregate growth based on the specific enduse markets and countries that the company supplies 

in november 2014 ppg completed the acquisition of comex mexico’s leading architectural coatings company the company targeted 45 million to 50 million in annual savings from business synergies throughout 2015 ppg executed actions to capture these synergies and achieved the targeted annual runrate savings in addition to cost synergies the company expects to realize 40 million to 50 million of annual revenue synergies related to the sale of legacy ppg products through comex’s distribution network also anticipated are other additional annual revenue synergies of 60 million to 70 million in central america by 2019 

during 2015 ppg announced a 140 million corporate restructuring program with anticipated annual savings of about 105 million once fully implemented the impact and expected cost saving encompass all major regions and most business units the company achieved approximately 20 million pretax in restructuringrelated savings in 2015 and expects to recognize an incremental 60 million to 70 million in additional restructuring savings in 2016 we expect substantially all 2015 restructuring actions to be completed in 2016 ppg 

2015 ppg annual report and form 10k 25 

remains aggressive with respect to cost management and will continually monitor the company’s cost structure relative to projected regional and end usemarket demand levels the company will proactively make adjustments to its cost structure as appropriate 

raw materials are a significant input cost in the manufacture of coatings ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors including supply and demand imbalances global industrial activity levels changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories and foreign currency exchange rates given the recent volatility in certain energybased input costs and foreign currencies the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2016 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing also given the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are sizable as are wages and benefits to a lesser degree in aggregate raw material feedstock prices in 2015 were lower including oilrelated products since oil is traded in us dollars globally the strengthening of the dollar against a wide variety of foreign currencies muted some of the oilrelated benefits in certain regions and in certain cases resulted in inflationary raw material prices 

pension and postretirement benefit costs excluding curtailments and special termination benefits were 173 million in 2015 up 50 million from 123 million in 2014 this change was principally due to a change in the mortality rates utilized to estimate the pension costs in 2016 the company will change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit costs for substantially all of its us and foreign plans historically the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period the company has elected to use a full yield curve approach “splitrate” to estimate these components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows the company will make this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs this change does not affect the measurement of the company’s total benefit obligations the company will account for this change as a change in estimate and accordingly will recognize its effect prospectively beginning in fiscal year 2016 we expect 2016 defined benefit expense to decrease by approximately 20 million to 25 million during 2015 ppgs cash contributions to defined benefit pension plans totaled 289 million total cash contributions to global defined benefit pension plans were 41 million and 174 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in the range of 35 million  to 40 million  in 2016  we may also make voluntary contributions to our us pension plans in 2016 and beyond 

in aggregate the company selling prices were flat in 2015 reflecting employeerelated cost inflation with energyrelated cost inputs providing an offset while selective pricing actions are currently planned in 2016 the company expects flat aggregate pricing again in 2016 

 

a variety of foreign currencies weakened throughout 2015 versus the us dollar for 2015 foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by 11 billion and pretax income by about 120 million based on midjanuary 2016 exchange rates the company expects yearoveryear currency translation to unfavorably impact 2016 sales by 550 million to 600 million and 2016 pretax income by about 70 million to 80 million since midjanuary certain foreign currencies have strengthened versus the us dollar as the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile thus the foreign currency impact on 2016 net sales and pretax income could differ from the midjanuary guidance the company generally purchases raw materials incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished products in the same currency so it typically incurs modest transactionalrelated currency impacts to earnings 

the company expects interest expense net of interest income in 2016 to be approximately 20 million higher than 2015 due to debt issuances during 2015 we also expect somewhat lower interest income in 2016 

we expect our adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 245 to 255 in 2016 this rate is slightly higher than the equivalent 2015 rate primarily due to a shift in the mix of earnings to jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates other factors may impact the 2016 tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year including changes to various tax regulations around the world 

over the past five years the company has used 35 billion of cash to repurchase about 49 million shares of stock the company ended the year with approximately 920 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization during 2015 the company deployed over 400 million for acquisitions purchase price and nearly 400 million for dividends ppg increased its annual pershare dividend by 7 in 2015 marking the 44th annual increase and the 116th consecutive year of dividend payments in january 2015 the company announced a cash deployment target for acquisitions and share repurchases of between 15 billion and 25 billion for years 2015 and 2016 combined the company adjusted this range in september 2015 to reflect the yeartodate pace of cash deployment to between 20 billion and 25 billion the company expects continued strong free cash generation in 2016

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement 

as discussed in item 3 and note 13 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 13 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

the company continues to analyze assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppg’s former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city nj and associated sites “new jersey chrome” information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the new jersey department of environmental protection no later than 2020 

there are multiple future events yet to occur including further remedy selection and design remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey chrome sites final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted 

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements to fund our capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders 

 

cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 

summary cash flow information 

cash from operating activities  continuing operations 

increases in cash from continuing operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 and in 2014 compared to 2013 were aided by higher income from continuing operations including income from acquired businesses 

operating working capital 

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 receivables from customers net of allowance for doubtful accounts 2 inventories and 3 trade liabilities see note 3 “working capital detail” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses operating working capital at december 31 2015  and 2014 was 23 billion  and 25 billion respectively 

a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales fourth quarter sales annualized 



operating working capital at december 31 2015 decreased 113 million compared with the prior year trade receivables from customers net as a percentage of 2015 fourth quarter sales annualized was 163 up slightly from 160 for 2014 days sales outstanding was 54 days in 2015 consistent with 2014 inventories on a fifo basis as a percentage of 2015 fourth quarter sales annualized was 126 compared to 135 in 2014 inventory turnover was 49 times in 2015 and 48 times in 2014 

cash outlays related to environmental remediation were 109 million  165 million and 111 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we expect cash outlays in 2016 to be between 40 million and 60 million

contractual obligations 

we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments cash from operations and the company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending including acquisitions dividend payments debt service amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table 





 

 in january 2016 all pending appeals of the pittsburgh corning plan of reorganization were withdrawn under the plan ppg and its participating insurers will make initial contributions to the asbestos trust established by the plan within 30 business days after the plan becomes effective and all conditions to funding have been met ppg anticipates that those conditions to funding will be satisfied and funding will take place in the first half of 2016 refer to note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

other liquidity matters 

at december 31 2015 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 90 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur 

the company has 50 billion of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 and 2014 these amounts relate to approximately 225 subsidiaries in more than 60 taxable jurisdictions as discussed in note 2 “acquisitions and dispositions” ppg recorded a deferred us income tax liability on the foreign earnings generated from the sale of its transitions optical joint venture in 2014 at december 31 2015 and 2014 the expected future tax cost to repatriate these earnings totaled 142 million  and 247 million  respectively no significant deferred us income taxes have been   provided on the remaining 42 billion of ppg’s undistributed earnings as they are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so the company estimates repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 and 2014 would have resulted in a us tax cost of approximately  375 million  and 200 million  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8 “borrowings and lines of credit” under item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes 

2015 ppg annual report and form 10k 29 

presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 11 “income taxes” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 12 “employee benefit plans” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

business combinations 

  in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows for more information on these matters see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

throughout 2015 and the last six months of 2014 the us dollar strengthened over prior year comparable periods against the currencies in most countries in which ppg operates most notably the euro and the mexican peso as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2015 and 2014 decreased by 704 million and 623 million respectively 

comparing exchange rates during 2015 to those of 2014 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was stronger overall which had an unfavorable impact on full year 2015 income before income taxes from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars of approximately 120 million 

comparing exchange rates during 2014 to those of 2013 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was weaker overall which had an immaterial favorable impact on full year 2014 income before income taxes from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors 

30  2015 ppg annual report and form 10k 

fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 

consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things lower sales or earnings business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 9 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2015  and 2014  were generally designated as a hedge of ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the fair value of these contracts was immaterial the potential reduction in ppg’s income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european and canadian currencies and 20 for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  would have been 29 million and 24 million respectively 

 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  ppg had us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 560 million outstanding as of december 31 2015  and 2014 the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 41 million and a net liability of 32 million respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of this instrument by 60 million as of december 31 2015  and increasing the liability by 70 million at december 31 2014  

as of december 31 2015  and 2014 ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 21 billion and 13 billion respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 242 million and 154 million as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 75 million and 62 million as of december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income from continuing operations or cash flows 

equity price risk 

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to an asbestos settlement trust see note 9 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of these instruments as of december 31 2015  and 2014  was an asset of 223 million and 268 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these instruments of 27 million and 32 million at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy while prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that our raw materials are downstream from crude oil and natural gas 

the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations 

our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption have been successful to date and are expected to continue titanium dioxide is a raw material widely used in the paint and coatings industry as a pigment to provide hiding durability and whiteness characteristics ppg purchases both sulfategrade and chloridegrade titanium dioxide from suppliers for use in coatings formulations the company has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide as well as to add to the global supply of this raw material ppg possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment and has and intends to continue to leverage this and engage potential parties to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations joint ventures licensing or other commercial initiatives 

ppg signed a license agreement with henan billions chemicals co ltd billions under which ppg has licensed certain chloridebased titanium dioxide technologies to billions for use at billions’ titanium dioxide refinement facilities in china in addition ppg has signed a longterm purchase agreement for titanium dioxide with billions in 2014 construction of billions titanium dioxide manufacturing and research facility was completed in the henan province of china the facility is scheduled to begin production in the first half of 2015 ppg intends to use the chloridebased titanium dioxide manufactured by billions for various enduse paint and coatings applications billions is also able to sell its chloridebased titanium dioxide to third parties 

in 2013 ppg signed a purchase and supply agreement as well as a research services agreement with argex titanium inc argex whereby ppg is providing technical support to argex in connection with their efforts to develop a unique and low cost process to manufacture pigment grade titanium dioxide 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product 

 

stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the eu and many other countries including china canada the united states and korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

given the volatility of certain energybased input costs at the end of 2014 the company is negotiating with suppliers on pricing for various raw materials initial discussions have resulted in a slight downward bias on the price of certain oilderived materials which account for a portion of the company’s overall raw material spend the company is also experiencing moderate inflation in certain other raw materials and other expense categories including employeerelated wage and benefit costs given the recent volatility in certain energybased input costs the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2015 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing 

research and development 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 509 million 479 million and 444 million during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively these costs totaled approximately 3 of annual sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we have obtained government funding of a small portion of the companys research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate 

 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes in addition to the companys centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 of this form 10k operating segments manage their development regionally through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the enduse markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management

  patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important however the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg earned 50 million in 2014 48 million  in 2013 and 51 million  in 2012 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

backlog 

 in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st  are summarized below 



refer to note 19 reportable business segment information under item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppgs property plant and equipment and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales 

seasonality 

ppg’s income from continuing operations have typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash flow from operations has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the us canada and europe the latin america paint season is strongest in the fourth quarter these higher activity levels result in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash flow 

 

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2014 was about 44400  the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs legislation and practice in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2014 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 126 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 24 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

      the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 317 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 75 million to 200 million these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 

capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 14 million 22 million and 12 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2015 will be in the range of 30 million to 40 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be 

12  2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 

anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs 

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible while ppg has operations in many countries a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary carbon disclosure project 

energy prices and availability of supply continue to be a concern for major energy users since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation from 2012 to 2013 energy consumption was reduced by 36 and ghg emission generation was reduced by 33 ppgs total annual energy consumption and ghg emissions were significantly reduced as a result of the separation of its commodity chemicals business in january 2013 from 2013 to 2014 energy consumption was reduced by 8 and ghg emission generation was reduced by 10

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings specialty materials and glass products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

         our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide generally comprise between 70 and 80 of cost of goods exclusive of depreciation and amortization sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

      while not our customary practice we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins may be lower 

      most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy 

      an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

      during 2014 overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies demand was also varied 

 

by major coatings enduse markets however we realized global growth in nearly all enduse categories 

we anticipate growth will remain the strongest in the us and canadian economies including a further strengthening of growth that started in 2014 in nonresidential construction we also expect increased global demand in the automotive oem and aerospace industries emerging regions growth is expected to remain mixed but we expect ppg to post solid aggregate growth based on the specific end usemarkets we supply our base case assumption is that european growth will remain mixed by country but subdued overall but european economies may benefit from lower global energy prices 

 ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash flows 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous waste the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and regulate various health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as described in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties the cost of which is substantial in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 75 million to 200 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and 

14  2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 

could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies could materially affect our financial results expressed in us dollars 

for over 30 years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and 

 

regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them 

new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2014 by products sold outside the us was approximately 59  

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

part of the companys strategy is growth through acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 



2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 15 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

       our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

 with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose a large regional or global customer or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate   

       increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches this could lead to negative publicity theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information manufacture of defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage 

16  2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 

with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

the results of any future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

for over 30 years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed asbestos settlement arrangement see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

in the past the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases

performance of reportable business segments   

performance coatings 

performance coatings net sales increased 764 million or approximately 10 from 2013 to 8698 million primarily due to net sales from acquisitions including the akzo nobel north american architectural coatings acquisition and comex partially offset by unfavorable currency translation acquisitions contributed an 8 increase in net sales for the year prices increased modestly and segment volumes excluding acquisitions advanced nearly 2 across all major regions 

architectural coatingsemea sales volumes improved by lowsingle digit percentages yearoveryear aided by partial demand recovery in some regions and in comparison to strengthening prior year levels sales volume improvement occurred early in the year aided by favorable weather conditions 

20  2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 

which was partially offset by lower yearoveryear sales volumes late in the year 

the protective and marine coatings business experienced modest sales improvement driven primarily by sales volume increases in the north american and european protective markets marine newbuild sales volumes were negative early in the year but positive late in the year 

the aerospace and automotive refinish businesses both delivered slightly higher sales volumes yearoveryear in each major region demand trends in the overall aerospace industry continued to remain favorable globally refinish growth was supported by higher emerging region activity and solid growth in the developed regions including benefits from the expansion of the vehicle parc in asia higher north american demand and a partial demand recovery in europe excluding the impacts of acquisitions and currency architectural coatings america and asia pacific net sales were up modestly year over year 

segment income increased 162 million or 16 from the prior year to 1205 million primarily due to the increase in net sales and acquisitions including the further realization of cost synergies partially offset by cost inflation 

in the first quarter of 2015 moderate north american architectural coatings market demand growth is expected to continue including growth in both residential and nonresidential end usemarkets the company will be making growthrelated investments during 2015 in certain architectural coatings distribution channels in the region this includes additional sales and marketing efforts and the addition of new companyowned store locations the protective and marine business is expected to deliver yearoveryear sales volume growth in the first quarter of 2015 due to improving asian marine new build enduse market demand 

looking forward for the segment the comex acquisition is expected to add between 180 to 200 million of sales in the first quarter 2015 additionally based on current exchange rates we expect foreign currency translation to be unfavorable in sequential and yearoveryear sales and earnings comparisons 

industrial coatings 

industrial coatings segment net sales increased 288 million or 6 from the prior year to 5552 million primarily due to sales volume growth of 6 ppg’s global automotive oem business grew net sales by high singledigit percentages yearoveryear and continued a multiquarter trend of outperforming global industry growth ppg continues to benefit from the adoption of new technologies and ongoing focus on customer service and customer process improvement initiatives growth accelerated in the industrial coatings business aided by continued north american and emerging region strength and european demand remained positive yearoveryear packaging coatings yearoveryear net sales were lower reflecting continued weakness in europe specialty coatings and materials net sales grew yearoveryear aided by higher sales volumes in oled materials optical materials precipitated silicas and teslin® 

segment income increased 127 million or 15 from the year ended december 31 2013 to 951 million primarily due to the benefit from sales volume growth and improved manufacturing 

 

costs as a result of our continued focus on increased productivity and efficiency 

the industrial coatings segment is our most geographically diverse segment and currency translation is expected to negatively impact yearoveryear financial results in the first quarter of 2015 on a sequential quarter basis we expect that higher sales seasonally will be partly offset by unfavorable currency translation as current rates are below fourth quarter average conversion rates for many currencies recent global industrial production trends are expected to continue resulting in generally consistent demand growth for ppg products 

glass 

glass net sales increased 43 million or 4 compared to the prior year to 1110 million primarily due to higher pricing and sales volumes in flat glass and higher sales volumes in fiber glass sales volumes in flat glass reflect improvements in residential and nonresidential enduse market demand partly offset by unfavorable currency translation primarily the canadian dollar 

segment income increased 25 million from 2013 to 81 million as the benefit of manufacturing cost improvements and the impact of improved sales were partially offset by higher costs stemming from scheduled maintenance projects higher natural gasbased energy costs early in the year were also a negative factor although this impact declined later in the year 

looking ahead overall demand growth is expected to continue in flat glass as is the favorable valueadded product mix mixed global fiber glass demand trends are expected to continue unfavorable currency translation is also expected sequentially and yearoveryear although the majority of the segment sales are us dollar denominated 

the segment will incur higher pension and other postemployment benefits opeb expense in 2015 versus 2014 stemming from revised mortality assumptions and a lower yearend discount rate however yearoveryear earnings comparisons will benefit from the absence of first quarter 2014 costs associated with significant plant maintenance projects 

review and outlook 

during 2014 overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies with the pace of economic activity in each region fairly constant throughout the year demand was also varied by major coatings enduse market however we realized global growth in nearly all enduse categories these economic trends were an important element in ppg’s aggregate sales volume growth of 35 compared to the previous year ppg achieved sales volume growth of greater than 2 in each major region for the year and sales volume growth improved in every major region versus 2013 growth levels 

yearoveryear sales volumes grew about 4 in the us and canada in 2014 with sales volume growth adding to strong prior year gains and broadbased growth across many ppg businesses the us and canada remained ppg’s largest region representing 47 of 2014 sales during 2014 industrial activity continued to improve in the region aided by low regional energy costs continued demand and production increases in several industries including automotive oem and aerospace 

2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 21 

construction spending in the region continued to recover in a measured manner us housing starts grew moderately during the year and were supplemented by continued modest improvement in the residential remodeling market nonresidential construction demand remained suppressed early in the year but exhibited stronger but inconsistent growth in the latter portion of the year although smaller in size demand growth in the canadian construction market was also modest growth in the region and various enduse markets was also aided somewhat by lower us unemployment rates which improved throughout the year falling energy and gasoline prices late in the year are expected to result in improved consumer spending and additional regional growth prospects for ppg entering 2015 

the pace of european economic activity remained subdued in 2014 with the region continuing to face limited employment growth industrial production and gross domestic product growth was mixed by country and generally weak across the region regional demand was strongest early in the year aided somewhat by modest winter weather conditions with ppg yearoveryear sales volumes advancing by about 5 in the first quarter demand trends were more muted for the remainder of the year with full year regional sales volume growth of 2 however the level of demand was not consistent across the various countries in the region as certain eastern european countries and the uk experienced solid demand growth while other large countries in the region including france remained challenged from a demand perspective europe remains a very large region for ppg representing just under onethird of ppg’s 2014 sales overall company sales volumes in the region are still down nearly 20 in comparison to 2008 prerecession levels reflecting economic weakness in prior years without any substantive or broad recovery from a currency perspective late in the year the euro weakened considerably against the us dollar while the regional economy remains muted a lower euro may aid exports in 2015 additionally global oil prices rapidly descended late in 2014 and the european economies stand to benefit considerably if prices remain at low levels in 2015 given the large level of oil imported in the region and no significant detriment to lower oil pricing given the minimal amount of oil production regionally 

in the aggregate emerging region economies continued to expand during 2014 however growth rates varied considerably by country and overall emerging region economic growth was lower than previous years the emerging market regions of asia and latin america represented 22 of ppg’s sales 2014 sales with asia the largest emerging region having sales of about 25 billion company sales volumes increased in asia overall by about 4 with china sales volume growth considerably higher china remained ppg’s second largest individual country from a sales perspective in 2014 as a result of the comex acquisition ppg has notably expanded our sales in emerging regions in 2015 mexico may overtake china as ppgs second largest individual country from a sales perspective the largest gains in asia were in the industrial coatings segment including the benefit of just below 10 industry growth in chinese automotive production offsetting these improvements was muted demand in a few enduse markets including consumer electronics and certain heavyduty equipment subsectors also 

 

marine newbuild activity was lower early in the year but began to grow later in the year demand in the latin american economies remained erratic due to a variety of economic factors including high inflation rates and weakening currencies in comparison to the us dollar ppgs latin american sales volumes were up 35 for the year with differences by enduse market and country heading into 2015 ppg anticipates consistent overall company sales volume growth in emerging regions supported by more moderate growth in china and less negative or improving demand in certain other emerging countries 

looking ahead to 2015 we anticipate growth rates will remain mixed by region with north american and asian economies continuing to grow at rates generally consistent with 2014 we anticipate growth will remain the strongest in the us economy including a further strengthening of initial growth that started in 2014 in nonresidential construction increased global demand is expected in the automotive oem and aerospace industries we expect emerging regions growth to remain mixed but we expect ppg to post solid aggregate growth based on the specific enduse markets the company supplies our base case assumption is that european growth will remain mixed by country but subdued overall but that exports may benefit from a weaker euro versus other currencies and lower global energy pricing 

in april 2013 ppg completed the acquisition of akzo nobel’s north american architectural coatings business the company targeted 200 million in annual savings relating to business synergies stemming from the acquisition throughout 2014 and 2013 ppg executed actions relating to capturing these synergies and substantially all of the actions were completed by the end of 2014 achieving the targeted annual runrate savings one year ahead of schedule we will realize incremental annual saving of about 20 million in 2015 related to synergy capture actions completed during 2014 that will not reach their anniversary until 2015 

during 2014 ppg also finalized substantially all of the actions related to previously announced company restructuring programs except for a few remaining actions related to the 2013 restructuring plan which are expected to be completed during the first half of 2015 ppg remains aggressive with respect to cost management and will continually monitor the company’s cost structure relative to projected regional and end usemarket demand levels the company will proactively make adjustments to its cost structure as appropriate 

raw materials are a significant input cost in the manufacture of coatings ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors including supply and demand imbalances global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories given the recent volatility in certain energybased input costs the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2015 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing also given the distribution nature of many of our businesses logistics and distribution costs are sizable costs as are wages and benefits but to a lesser degree for 2014 in aggregate these cost components were similar yearoveryear with certain categories 

22  2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 

increasing such as logistics costs and wages in certain regions while others were flat or declined modestly 

pension and postretirement benefit costs excluding curtailments and special termination benefits were 123 million in 2014 down 54 million from 177 million in 2013 in 2015 we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase by approximately 60 to 65 million due to revised mortality assumptions and a lower liability discount rate as measured at yearend 2014 during 2014 ppgs cash contributions to defined benefit pension plans totaled 41 million total cash contributions to global defined benefit pension plans were 174 million and 80 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in the range of 10 million  to 20 million  in 2015  

in an effort to offset the adverse impact of cost inflation on income from continuing operations in 2014 the company implemented modestly higher selling prices with overall pricing up onehalf of one percent for the year selective pricing actions are currently planned in 2015 with actions expected to differ by business and region 

a variety of foreign currencies began to weaken in the second half of 2014 versus the us dollar based on midjanuary 2015 exchange rates the company expects yearoveryear currency translation will unfavorably impact 2015 sales by 650 million to 750 million and 2015 earnings by about 65 million to 75 million since midjanuary certain foreign currencies have continued to weaken versus the us dollar thus the unfavorable currency translation impact to 2015 sales and earnings could be larger than the midjanuary 2015 ranges stated above the company generally purchases raw materials incurs manufacturing cost and sells finished products in the same currency so it typically incurs more modest transactionalrelated currency impacts to earnings 

the company expects 55 million of lower net interest expense for 2015 due to a debt refinancing completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 partially offset by lower interest income from lower aggregate cash and shortterm investment balances in 2015 the net interest savings will vary by quarter yearoveryear net interest expense is expected to be approximately 20 million lower in the first quarter and range from 10 million to 15 million lower in the second third and fourth quarters 

we expect our ongoing effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 240 to 250 in 2015 this rate is slightly higher than the 2014 rate primarily due to the impact of earnings from the acquired business of comex which are primarily earned in mexico where the statutory tax rate is higher than the company’s effective global tax rate because of the differences in the tax rates in the countries in which we operate a shift in the geographic mix of earnings will impact our overall ongoing tax rate 

over the past five years the company used 33 billion of cash to repurchase about 28 million shares of stock and the company ended the year with approximately 17 billion remaining under the current authorization from the board of directors ppg announced in january 2014 its intention to 

 

deploy between 30 billion and 40 billion of incremental cash over an 18 to 24 month period during 2014 the company deployed approximately 32 billion of cash for acquisitions including repayment of acquired debt and share repurchases in january 2015 the company announced a new cash deployment target for acquisitions and share repurchases of between 15 billion and 25 billion for years 2015 and 2016 combined the company expects continued strong free cash flow in 2015

performance in 2013 compared with 2012 

performance overview 

net sales increased 1579 million or 12 from the prior year to 14265 million primarily due to sales of acquired businesses which increased net sales by approximately 10 the akzo nobel north american architectural coatings business acquired in april 2013 contributed approximately 1165 million in net sales while the acquisitions of deft an aerospace coatings business acquired in may 2013 and the spraylat coatings business acquired in december 2012 contributed approximately 166 million combined 

overall sales volumes excluding acquisitions were level with the prior year as sales volume growth in the industrial coatings and glass segments as well as the aerospace business was offset by a volume declines in the other businesses in the performance coatings segment sales volumes were inconsistent by region the us and canada and the latin america regions sales volumes were up nearly 3 year over year growth occurred in many enduse markets in asia pacific although total sales volumes for the region were nearly level year over year due to declines stemming from lower marine newbuild enduse market demand sales volumes in europe were down 3 year over year due to weak demand that occurred in the first half of the year the 2013 volume decline in europe continued the trend experienced since the recession began in 2009 higher selling prices added just over 1 to net sales which included the carryover impact from 2012 price increases to offset current year inflation in certain cost components including increases in transportation energy and labor costs the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was flat for the year although results were mixed by currency 

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased 715 million or 9 from the prior year to 8314 million primarily due to the inclusion of cost of sales from acquired businesses partially offset by lower manufacturing costs cost of sales as a percentage of sales in 2013 was 583 compared to 599 in 2012 this decrease is largely due to shifts in sales margin mix related to the businesses acquired 

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 499 million or 17 from the prior year to 3486 million 

2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 23 

principally related to the inclusion of acquired businesses and overhead cost inflation partly offset by the impact of our continued focus on cost management including savings from restructuring actions initiated in 2012 as a percent of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased slightly to 244 in 2013 from 235 in 2012 primarily due to the addition of acquired businesses which have higher distribution related costs 

depreciation expense increased 41 million or 14 from the prior year to 333 million primarily due to the depreciation of the acquired businesses 

the pretax restructuring charge of 98 million relates to a restructuring plan approved in the third quarter of 2013 focused on achieving cost synergies through improved productivity and efficiency related to the acquired north american architectural coatings business but also includes smaller targeted actions for ppgs legacy architectural business as well as other businesses where market conditions remain very challenging most notably protective and marine coatings and certain european businesses such as architectural coatings and fiber glass 

other charges decreased 34 million or 15 from the prior year to 189 million primarily due to lower legacy environmental remediation charges in 2013 in 2013 the largest charge included in other charges relates to a pretax charge of 89 million for the environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey and a pretax charge of 12 million related to environmental remediation at a legacy chemical manufacturing site the 2012 other charges included a pretax charge of 159 million related primarily to the environmental remediation at the former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey 

other income decreased 11 million or 8 from the prior year to 127 million primarily due to lower equity earnings primarily from our asian fiber glass joint ventures as a result of a decline in demand in the personal computer market and lower licensing earnings in the glass segment 

the effective tax rate on income before income taxes was 206 and 179 in 2013 and 2012 respectively the companys adjusted effective tax rate on income before income taxes excluding certain charges was 231 in 2013 and 214 in 2012 see the regulation g reconciliation below for details of ppgs adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations 

diluted earningspershare for 2013 were 2227 pershare comprised of net income from continuing operations of 655 pershare and discontinued operations net of tax of 1572 pershare the increase in diluted earningspershare resulted from higher net income and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding as a result of the 108 million ppg shares tendered to the company in the exchange offer in connection with the separation and merger of the companys former commodity chemicals business as well as the approximately 57 million shares repurchased during 2013 for more information about the separation and merger of the companys former commodity chemicals business see note 2 “acquisitions and dispositions ” under item 8 of this form 10k

results of reportable business segments 

performance coatings 

performance coatings net sales increased 1035 million or 15 from the prior year to 7934 million primarily due to net sales from businesses acquired 18 and modestly higher pricing partially offset by lower sales volumes 5 sales volumes remained varied by region and business sales volume growth continued in the aerospace coatings business where 

 

industry demand remains strong automotive refinish sales volumes were level with the prior year as growth in the asia pacific and latin american regions offset sales volume declines in europe while the north american refinish sales volumes were consistent with 2012 offsetting the segment sales volume gains was a decline in sales volume in the protective and marine coatings business due to further notable weakness in the asian marine newbuild market reflecting lower global demand us and canada architectural coatings sales volume declined by lowsingledigit percentages with midtohigh single digit percentage same store growth in companyowned stores lower sales in national retail accounts and lower sales in the independent dealer channel the lower sales volume in the national account channel was due to a previously disclosed change in products sold to a large retail customer emea architectural coatings sales declined vs prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes down midsingledigit percentages as economic conditions worsened in most european countries however market demand improved somewhat in the second half of the year but remained negative overall and mixed across the region poor weather conditions in the first half of 2013 were also a contributor to the decline in emea architectural coatings sales volumes the decline in emea architectural coatings sales volumes was partially offset by the impacts of favorable pricing and foreign currency translation segment income was 1043 million for 2013 an increase of 154 million or 17 compared to the prior year primarily due to the income from acquired businesses lower overhead and manufacturing costs stemming from prior restructuring actions and ongoing cost management offset partially by the negative impact on segment income from the lower sales volumes 

industrial coatings 

industrial coatings net sales increased 509 million or 11 from the prior year to 5264 million primarily due to sales volume growth 6 and net sales from acquired businesses 4 in 2013 ppgs global automotive oem coatings sales volumes grew 10 outpacing global industry auto production growth of about 3 yearoveryear the industrial coatings business experienced varied sales volume results by region compared with the prior year as strong improvements across emerging regions and modestly higher sales volumes in north america were offset by weak demand in europe packaging coatings sales volumes grew modestly in asia pacific and latin america were down lowsingledigits yearoveryear in europe and essentially flat in north america specialty coatings and materials sales volumes increased as the silicas business business achieved higher year over year sales volumes in both the us and europe as a result of solid demand growth segment income increased 147 million or 22 from the prior year to 824 million primarily due to the impact from the higher sales coupled with ongoing cost management initiatives and the benefits from the companys restructuring actions initiated in 2012 

2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 25 

glass 

glass segment net sales increased 35 million or 3 from the prior year to 1067 million primarily due to higher fiber glass sales volumes sales volumes in fiber glass increased modestly reflecting higher global demand in various enduse markets segment income was 56 million a decrease of 7 million or 11 from the prior year primarily due to input cost inflation including higher natural gas costs lower licensing income and lower fiber glass equity earnings stemming from weaker personal computer production activity in asia these negative factors more than offset reductions in manufacturing costs 

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement 

as discussed in item 3 and note 13 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 13 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

  as of december 31 2014  and 2013 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 317 million  and 337 million  respectively of which 141 million  and 133 million  respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2014 2013 and 2012 totaled 144 million  108 million and 166 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income cash outlays related to environmental remediation were 165 million  111 million and 62 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters now estimated to 

 

be approximately 75 million to 200 million which is lower than the estimate of 100 million to 200 million as of december 31 2013 as a result of the additional environmental remediation charge recorded in the third quarter of 2014 explained below such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them the impact of evolving programs such as natural resource damage claims industrial site reuse initiatives and state remediation programs also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this unreserved exposure to future loss the company’s assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation if necessary of such environmental contingencies and the potential for technological and regulatory developments 

the company continues to analyze assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppgs former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city nj and associated sites new jersey chrome during the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 ppg completed assessments of costs incurred to date versus current progress and the potential cost impacts of the most recent information based on these assessments the company recorded reserve adjustments of 136 million and 89 million in the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 respectively principal factors impacting costs included a refinement in the estimate of the mix of hazardous to nonhazardous soils to be excavated an overall increase in soil volumes to be excavated enhanced water management requirements decreased daily soil excavation rates due to site conditions initial estimates for remedial actions related to groundwater and increased oversight and management costs 

a charge of 145 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of updated information the company compiled about the sites that was used to develop a new estimate of the cost to remediate these sites the updated information was compiled in connection with the preparation of a final draft soil remedial action work plan and cost estimate 

the charges for estimated environmental remediation costs for the previous three years have been significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding the charges related to new jersey chrome pretax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between 10 million and 30 million per year for the past 10 years 

information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to new jersey department of environmental protection in late 2015 or 2016

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements to fund our capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders 

cash from continuing operating activities was 1807 million 1562 million and 1410 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively increases in cash from continuing operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012 were aided by higher income from continuing operations including income from acquired businesses 

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 receivables from customers net of allowance for doubtful accounts 2 inventories and 3 trade liabilities see note 3 “working capital detail” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses operating working capital at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 25 billion  and 26 billion respectively a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales fourth quarter sales annualized 



a inclusive of amounts related to ppgs interest in the transitions optical joint venture and sunlens businesses that were sold on march 31 2014 excluding the interest in these businesses operating working capital was 2503 or 179 at december 31 2013 

operating working capital at december 31 2014 decreased 189 million compared with the prior year trade receivables from customers net as a percentage of 2014 fourth quarter sales annualized was 160  down slightly from 162 for 2013 days sales outstanding was 54 days in 2014 a 3 day improvement from 2013 inventories on a fifo basis as a percentage of 2014 fourth quarter sales annualized was 135 compared to 136 in 2013 inventory turnover was 48 times in 2014 and 45 times in 2013

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 11 

 

“income taxes” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 12 “employee benefit plans” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the weighted average discount rate assumption at december 31 2014 is 40 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the weighted average discount rate assumption for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2013 was 483 a change in the discount rate of 100 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would impact 2015 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 24 million and 15 million respectively 

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2014 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 725 this assumption is unchanged for 2015 a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points with other assumptions held constant would impact 2015 net periodic pension expense by approximately 26 million 

business combinations 

  in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in accordance 

2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 29 

with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets 

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors including reporting unit or asset specific financial information as well as industry market and general economic conditions to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount including goodwill when testing goodwill for impairment the company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets and perform a quantitative test fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on the 2014 impairment tests none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as otherwise required by applicable law you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives and ppgs ability to integrate the comex business acquisition and to achieve anticipated synergies however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k 

30  2014 ppg annual report and form 10k 

and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 9 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2014 and 2013 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of december 31 2014 and 2013 was insignificant the potential reduction in ppg’s income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 would have been 24 million and 9 million respectively 

as of january 1 2012 ppg had us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 116 billion outstanding of which 600 million were settled in june 2012 the remaining outstanding contracts of 560 million  are expected to be settled in march 2018 on settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts ppg will receive 560 million us dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts during the term of these contracts ppg receives semiannual payments in march and september of each year based on us dollar longterm fixed interest rates and ppg makes annual payments in march of each year to the counterparties based on euro longterm fixed interest rates the company designated all of the cross currency swaps as hedges of its net investment in acquired european coatings businesses and as a result the mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps outstanding have been and will be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive lossincome aoci and the cash flow impact of these swaps has been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 32 million and 120 million respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by 70 

 

million and 81 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 1325 million as of december 31 2014 and 453 million as of december 31 2013 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 154 million and 53 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs during 2012 ppg settled interest rate swaps with a notional value of 445 million that converted fixed rate debt to variable rate debt receiving 29 million from such settlements a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 62 million as of december 31 2014 and 81 million as of december 31 2013 however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income from continuing operations or cash flows 

equity price risk 

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 9 “financial instruments hedging activities and fair value measurements” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of december 31 2014 and 2013 was an asset of 268 million and 207 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of 32 million and 26 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively

raw materials and energy 

        the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses lenses sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials segment and sand clay and soda ash in the glass segment coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide generally comprise between 70 and 80 of cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

       energy is a significant production cost in the glass segment and our primary energy source is natural gas with the separation of the commodity chemicals business ppgs consumption of natural gas decreased significantly natural gas is expected to remain a competitive fuel source when compared to alternatives especially on a global basis we will continue to use competitive sourcing and consumption reduction initiatives to manage natural gas costs 

       most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption resulted in a 4 reduction and an additional 2 reduction in 2012 and 2013 respectively 

the company also has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide as well as to add to the global supply of this raw material ppg possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment and has and intends to continue to leverage this and engage potential parties to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations joint ventures licensing or other commercial initiatives 

      in 2012 ppg signed a license agreement with henan billions chemicals co ltd billions by which ppg will license certain chloridebased titanium dioxide technologies to billions for use at billions’ titanium dioxide refinement facilities in china in addition ppg has signed a longterm purchase agreement for titanium dioxide with billions ppg intends to use the chloridebased titanium dioxide manufactured by billions for various enduse paint and coatings applications billions is also able to sell its chloridebased titanium dioxide to third parties 

 

      in 2013 ppg signed a purchase and supply agreement as well as a research services agreement with argex titanium inc argex whereby ppg is providing technical support to argex in connection with their efforts to develop a unique and low cost process to manufacture pigment grade titanium dioxide 

      we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the eu and many other countries including china canada the united states and korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations 

      for 2014 the company currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase modestly with varied results by region and commodity type natural gas pricing remains volatile although increased output and infrastructure development from shale gas should continue to play a role in muting longterm changes in natural gas pricing 

research and development 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 505 million 468 million and 443 million during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively these costs totaled approximately 3 of annual sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we have obtained government funding of a small portion of the companys research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding 

 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes in addition to the companys centralized principal research and development centers see item 2 of this form 10k our operating segments manage their development regionally through centers of excellence as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the enduse markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management

  patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important however the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg earned 48 million  in 2013 51 million  in 2012 and 55 million  in 2011 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

backlog 

 in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

global operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended december 31 st  are summarized below 



refer to note 21 reportable business segment information under item 8 of this form 10k for geographic information related to ppgs property plant and equipment and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales 

seasonality 

ppg’s income from continuing operations have typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash flow from operations has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses the magnitude of which increased in 2013 due to the size of the acquired north american architectural coatings business demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in north america and europe this higher activity level results in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash flow 

 

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2013 was about 41400  the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world we observe local customs legislation and practice in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements there were no significant work stoppages in 2013 while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 132 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 24 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

      the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

in addition to the 310 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately 100 million to 200 million these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites including about one third each related to i additional costs at a former chromium manufacturing plant site and associated sites in jersey city nj new jersey chrome ii legacy glass sites and iii a number of other sites including legacy chemical manufacturing sites the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 

capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 22 million 12 million and 15 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2014 will be in the range of 15 million to 

12 2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 

20 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs 

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible while ppg has operations in many countries a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary carbon disclosure project 

energy prices and availability of supply continue to be a concern for major energy users since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation effective energy management practices implemented over the 2006 to 2011 time period led to a 10 reduction in ppgs ghg emissions at the end of 2011 ppgs total annual energy consumption and ghg emissions was significantly reduced as a result of the separation of its commodity chemicals business in january 2013 

ppg participates in the us department of energy “doe” save energy now ®  better buildings ®  better plants ®  program reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity in september 2011 the doe changed its approach to energy efficiency in the industrial sector and initiated the better buildings better plants program ppg is currently participating in this new program which sets energy savings targets and provides a suite of educational training and technical resources to help meet those targets recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area 

in december 2012 the usepa issued its final clean air act emissions standards for large and small boilers and incinerators that burn fossil fuels known as the boiler maximum achievable control technology “boiler mact” regulations these regulations are aimed at controlling emissions of air toxics requiring that covered facilities achieve compliance within three years at the time the rules were issued the principal financial impact to ppg was related to 

 

operations within its former commodity chemicals business which was separated in january 2013 the remaining 12 ppg facilities that are subject to these regulations have natural gasfired boilers which are subject to minimal regulatory oversight requiring only changes to workplace practices and no capital expenditures for pollution control equipment the cost impact for ppgs remaining affected facilities is expected to be minimal

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings optical and specialty materials and glass products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

         our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials coatings raw materials which include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide generally comprise between 70 and 80 of cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component 

      we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins are at risk of being lowered 

      most of the raw materials used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations our products use both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy 

      an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

      during 2012 and 2013 overall economic trends remained mixed among the major global economies with major coatings enduse markets also experiencing similar variations given these economic conditions overall aggregate ppg 

 

global sales volume for 2013 was flat with the prior year entering 2014 we expect modest global growth we anticipate growth will be the broadest in the us economy spanning across several coatings enduse markets as favorable market conditions continue in automotive oem architectural coatings and aerospace we expect emerging regions growth to remain mixed but we expect ppg to post solid growth based on the endmarkets the company supplies in europe economies appear to be improving but remain fragile 

 ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets and in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any significant or rapid decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash flows 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and regulate various health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to including those in the us as well as in other countries in which we operate impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as described in note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our facilities and properties the cost of which is substantial in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 100 million to 200 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims 

14 2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 

involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described in note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

for over 30 years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them 

new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact i the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor ii our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in global operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and 

 

economic conditions of many countries as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2013 by products sold outside the us was approximately 59 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies could materially affect our financial results 

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

part of the companys strategy is growth through acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 



2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 15 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to innovate develop produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results 

       our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 

 with each of our businesses an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share lose a large regional or global customer or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive which could result in reduced margins for our products competitive pressures may not only impair our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate   

       increased global information technology security requirements threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches this could lead to negative publicity theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information manufacture of defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims 

16 2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 

against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

the results of any future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

for over 30 years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed asbestos settlement arrangement see note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

in the past the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

separation of ppgs commodity chemicals business and acquisition of the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel nv 

in 2013 ppg completed two additional steps in its strategic transformation into a more focused coatings and specialty materials company 

ppg completed the first step on january 28 2013 with the separation of its commodity chemicals business and the merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of the georgia gulf corporation georgia gulf refer to note 22 separation and merger transaction under item 8 of this form 10k for financial information relating to this transaction 

the second step was completed on april 1 2013 with the completion of the acquisition of the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel nv the acquisition included the purchase of a number of leading brands and 526 paint stores net of redundant store closures in the us canada and the caribbean refer to note 2 acquisitions and divestitures under item 8 of this form 10k for financial information relating to this transaction 

performance in 2013 compared with 2012 

performance overview 

net sales increased 1596 million or 12 from the prior year to 15108 million primarily due to sales of acquired businesses which increased net sales by approximately 10 the akzonobel north american architectural coatings business acquired in april 2013 contributed approximately 1165 million in net sales while the acquisitions of deft an aerospace coatings business acquired in may 2013 and the spraylat coatings business acquired in december 2012 contributed approximately 166 million combined 

overall sales volumes excluding acquisitions were level with the prior year as sales volume growth in the industrial coatings optical and specialty materials and glass segments as well as the aerospace business was offset by volume declines in the remaining segments and other businesses sales volumes were inconsistent by region the us and canada and the latin america regions sales volumes were up nearly 3 year over

year growth occurred in many enduse markets in asia pacific although total sales volumes for the region were nearly level year over year due to declines stemming from lower marine newbuild enduse market demand sales volumes in europe were down 4 year over year due to weak demand that occurred in the first half of the year the 2013 volume decline in europe continued the trend experienced since the recession began in 2009 aggregate ppg coatings volumes in that region have declined over 20 versus year 2008 prerecession levels whereas combined ppg coatings volumes in the remaining regions are higher in comparison to year 2008 prerecession levels as growth in emerging regions of nearly 20 has been partially offset by a 5 decline in the us and canada higher selling prices added just over 1 to net sales which included the carryover impact from 2012 price increases to offset current year inflation in certain cost components including increases in transportation energy and labor costs the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was flat for the year although results were mixed by currency 

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased 731 million or 9 from the prior year to 8636 million primarily due to the inclusion of cost of sales from acquired businesses partially offset by lower manufacturing costs cost of sales as a percentage of sales in 2013 was 572 compared to 585 in 2012 this decrease is largely due to shifts in sales margin mix related to the businesses acquired 

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 499 million or 16 from the prior year to 3699 million principally related to the inclusion of acquired businesses and overhead cost inflation partly offset by the impact of our continued focus on cost management including savings from restructuring actions initiated in 2012 as a percent of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased slightly to 245 in 2013 from 237 in 2012 primarily due to the addition of acquired businesses which have higher distribution related costs 

depreciation expense increased 44 million or 14 from the prior year to 356 million primarily due to the depreciation of the acquired businesses 

the restructuring charge of 98 million relates to a restructuring plan approved in the third quarter of 2013 focused on achieving cost synergies through improved productivity and efficiency related to the acquired north american architectural coatings business but also includes smaller targeted actions for ppgs legacy architectural business as well as other businesses where market conditions remain very challenging most notably protective and marine coatings and certain european businesses such as architectural coatings and fiber glass 

other charges decreased 34 million or 15 from the prior year to 190 million primarily due to lower legacy environmental remediation charges in 2013 in 2013 the largest charge included in other charges relates to a pretax charge of 89 million for the environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey and a pretax charge of 12 million related to environmental remediation at a legacy chemical manufacturing site the 2012 other charges included a pretax charge of 159 million related primarily to the environmental remediation at the former 

 

chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey 

other income decreased 8 million or 6 from the prior year to 131 million primarily due to lower equity earnings primarily from our asian fiber glass joint ventures as a result of a decline in demand in the personal computer market and lower licensing earnings in the glass segment

performance of reportable business segments   

performance coatings net sales increased 1120 million or 24 from the prior year to 5872 million primarily due to net sales from businesses acquired 25 and modestly higher pricing partially offset by lower sales volumes 4 sales volumes remained varied by region and business volume growth continued in the aerospace coatings business where industry demand remains strong automotive refinish volumes were level with the prior year as growth in the asia pacific and latin american regions offset volume declines in europe while the north american refinish volumes were consistent with 2012 offsetting the segment sales volume gains was a decline in volume in the protective and marine coatings business due to further notable weakness in the asian marine newbuild market reflecting lower global demand us and canada architectural coatings sales volume declined by lowsingledigit percentages with midtohigh single digit percentage same store growth in companyowned stores lower sales in national retail accounts 

20 2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 

and lower sales in the independent dealer channel the lower sales volume in the national account channel was due to a previously disclosed change in products sold to a large retail customer segment income was 858 million for 2013 an increase of 114 million or 15 compared to the prior year primarily due to the income from acquired businesses lower overhead and manufacturing costs stemming from prior restructuring actions and ongoing cost management offset partially by the negative impact on segment income from the lower sales volumes 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014 we expect aerospace growth to continue despite more difficult comparisons following several consecutive years of solid growth we also anticipate global refinish continued growth as initial european demand recovery supplements growth in emerging regions we expect marine newbuild demand to remain weak but less negative yearoveryear than in 2013 as marine newbuild demand levels off 

north american architectural coatings industry market conditions are expected to remain solid and we expect growth to occur in all three distribution channels at the beginning of 2014 ppg implemented midsingledigit percentage price increases in companyowned stores we anticipate normal architectural coatings seasonality to result in higher first quarter sales versus the recently completed fourth quarter we expect first quarter 2014 segment results to benefit from the acquiredbusiness sales and income from continuing operations including a higher level of cost synergies 

industrial coatings net sales increased 466 million or 11 from the prior year to 4845 million primarily due to volume growth 6 and net sales from acquired businesses 4 in 2013 ppgs global automotive oem coatings sales volumes grew 10 outpacing global industry auto production growth of about 3 yearoveryear the industrial coatings business experienced varied sales volume results by region compared with the prior year as strong improvements across emerging regions and modestly higher volumes in north america were offset by weak demand in europe packaging coatings sales volumes grew modestly in asia pacific and latin america were down lowsingledigits yearoveryear in europe and essentially flat in north america segment income increased 134 million or 23 from the prior year to 724 million primarily due to the impact from the higher sales coupled with ongoing cost management initiatives and the benefits from the companys restructuring actions initiated in 2012 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014 we expect global growth in general industrial activity to continue including solid north american growth continuing growth in emerging regions and improved european demand similarly we expect growth in global automotive oem production to be consistent with recent quarters with forecasted growth in all major regions we expect our automotive oem business to deliver abovemarket growth 

architectural coatings – emea net sales decreased 85 million or 4 from the prior year to 2062 million primarily due to lower sales volumes 7 as economic conditions worsened in most european countries however market demand improved somewhat in the second half of the year but remained negative overall and mixed across the region poor 

 

weather conditions in the first half of 2013 were also a contributor to the decline in sales volumes the decline in sales volumes was partially offset by the impacts of favorable pricing and foreign currency translation 2 despite the yearoveryear volume decline segment income was 184 million in 2013 an increase of 39 million or 27 from the prior year primarily due to lower costs including discretionary cost management coupled with the structural cost improvements stemming from the restructuring actions initiated in 2012 partially offset by the impact of lower net sales on income from continuing operations 

looking ahead yearoveryear segment income for 2013 was greatly aided by cost savings stemming from restructuring actions that are substantially completed accordingly 2014 results will be more dependent on the pace of regional volume demand we anticipate normal seasonal architectural coatings sales growth in the first quarter of 2014 we expect demand in the region to continue to stabilize in comparison to negative yearoveryear market results in 2013 and results will likely remain mixed by enduse market based on current exchange rates currency translation will aid first quarter net sales but remain inconsequential to segment income 

optical and specialty materials net sales increased 60 million or 5 from the prior year to 1262 million primarily due to an increase in sales volumes 3 and higher pricing 2 the increase in sales was driven by strong demand at the end of 2013 as volumes were aided by initial customer inventory stocking ahead of the january 2014 north american introduction of transitions  generation vii this brought yeartodate sales above prior year levels as sales in this segment had been lower versus a strong first half of 2012 that was aided by the optical industry recovery from the fourth quarter 2011 thailand flooding and related inventory restocking the silicas business achieved higher year over year volumes in both the us and europe as a result of solid demand growth segment income was 368 million an increase of 20 million or 6 from the prior year primarily due to an increase in sales and lower fullyear selling and marketing costs 

looking ahead optical demand is typically higher seasonally during the first quarter versus the fourth quarter the transitions  new product was launched last year in europe and the launch is now underway in north america the first quarter of 2014 will likely include modestly higher selling costs including support for the product launch we expect silica demand growth to continue 

glass segment net sales increased 35 million or 3 from the prior year to 1067 million primarily due to higher fiber glass sales volumes sales volumes in fiber glass increased modestly reflecting higher global demand in various enduse markets segment income was 56 million a decrease of 7 million or 11 from the prior year primarily due to input cost inflation including higher natural gas costs lower licensing income and lower fiber glass equity earnings stemming from weaker personal computer production activity in asia these negative factors more than offset reductions in manufacturing costs 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014 market demand for the fiber glass and flat glass businesses is expected to improve versus weak prior year results increased flat glass 

2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 21 

pricing has been announced and varies based on product geography and enduse market a significant scheduled flat glass tank maintenance project is underway with an anticipated first quarter negative impact on segment income of about 10 million and a modest impact to the second quarter of 2014 also we expect natural gas unit costs and transportation costs to be higher yearoveryear based on current market pricing 

review and outlook 

       during 2013 overall economic conditions remained mixed among the main global economies with major coatings enduse markets also experiencing similar variations these economic trends were an important factor in ppg’s aggregate sales volume being flat compared to the previous year 

       ppg increased volumes in north america in 2013 with volume growth adding to strong prior year gains and broadbased improvements across most enduse markets north america remains ppg’s largest region representing 46 of sales regional industrial activity continued to improve aided by low energy costs stemming from shale energy production and due to continued demand and production increases in several industries including automotive oem and aerospace regional recovery continued in construction spending aided by higher us housing starts and initial improvement in the residential remodeling market while nonresidential construction demand remained suppressed although smaller in size demand in the canadian construction market was also subdued growth in the region and various enduse markets was also somewhat tempered by reduced us federal and state government spending throughout the year us unemployment rates improved and consumer spending expanded supporting expectations for additional regional growth prospects for ppg entering 2014 

       the pace of european economic activity remained challenging during 2013 with the region continuing to face high unemployment and weak growth in industrial production and gross domestic product regional demand was extremely weak early in the year with ppg yearoveryear volumes declining by about 10 in comparison with a weak first quarter of 2012 during the remainder of 2013 the pace of decline in ppgs aggregate yearoveryear coatings volumes lessened with each successive quarter ending with fourth quarter volume flat with the prior year although the level of demand improvement was not consistent across the various countries in the region overall regional economic activity continued to stabilize throughout the year europe remains a very large region for ppg representing about onethird of ppg’s sales overall company volumes in the region are down about 20 in comparison to 2008 prerecession levels reflecting the multiyear weakness experienced throughout most of the region while most of the regional economies remain fragile we see prospects for initial demand recovery in certain markets as we head into 2014 

       in the aggregate emerging region economies continued to expand during 2013 however growth rates were more modest versus prior years growth also varied considerably by individual country and by industry within countries the emerging markets regions of asia and latin america represent 22 of ppg’s sales with asia the largest emerging region representing sales of 26 billion china is now ppg’s second 

 

largest individual country from a sales perspective and demand in china and overall asia expanded for ppg products in most industrial markets including higher automotive production offsetting these improvements was decreased global demand in a few enduse markets including personal computers and marine newbuild as the majority of the global production in these markets occurs in asia demand in the latin american economies remained erratic due to a variety of factors including high inflation rates ppgs latin american volumes were slightly favorable for the year with differences by enduse market heading into 2014 ppg anticipates overall company volume growth in emerging regions supported by continued economic growth in china and the absence of large volume declines in certain enduse markets like marine newbuild 

        looking ahead to 2014 we expect modest global growth to continue we anticipate growth will remain the broadest in the us economy spanning across several coatings enduse markets as favorable market conditions continue in automotive oem architectural coatings and aerospace we expect emerging regions growth to remain mixed but we expect ppg to post solid aggregate growth based on the various endmarkets the company supplies in europe economies appear to be improving but remain fragile we anticipate modest growth in that region in 2014 and we expect solid segment income accretion benefits from the higher sales due to the actions taken the past two years to significantly reduce ppg’s cost structure in that region 

      in 2012 ppg initiated a restructuring program to improve its productivity and efficiency primarily focused on europe with targeted annual savings of 140 million throughout 2012 and 2013 ppg continued to execute actions relating to this program and substantially completed all the actions by the end of 2013 achieving the targeted annual savings level of about 140 million on a runrate basis incremental annual savings of about 80 million annually were realized in 2013 in addition to the savings achieved during 2012 

       ppg intends to remain proactive in managing our costs ppg’s board of directors approved a separate restructuring program resulting in a pretax charge of 98 million in the third quarter of 2013 the restructuring program targets an additional 100 million in annual cost savings the primary focus of this program is to capture cost synergies through improved productivity and efficiency related to ppg’s north american architectural coatings acquisition along with separate targeted actions relating to several other ppg businesses where business conditions remain challenging including protective and marine coatings fiber glass and architectural coatings emea actions related to this program began in late 2013 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2014 with cost savings of between 75 million and 90 million in 2014 

       raw materials are a significant input cost in the manufacture of coatings and ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by factors including supplydemand imbalances global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories for 2014 the company currently expects overall coatings raw material prices 

22 2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 

to increase modestly with results varied by region and commodity type 

       in an effort to offset the adverse impact of cost inflation on income from continuing operations the company implemented higher coatings selling prices in 2011 and 2012 in 2013 additional targeted pricing was implemented in several businesses selling prices in glass improved modestly during 2013 reflecting efforts to offset higher input energy and logistics costs selective pricing actions are planned in 2014 with actions expected to differ by business and region 

       pension and postretirement benefit costs excluding curtailments and special termination benefits were 177 million in 2013 down 56 million from 233 million in 2012 this decline was due in part to a reorganization of certain company pension plans which occurred as a part of separation activities of the former commodity chemicals business in 2014 we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to decline roughly 15 million due to strong pension asset performance and a higher discount rate as measured at yearend 2013 during 2013 ppgs cash contributions to defined benefit pension plans totaled 174 million including voluntary contributions to the us pension plans of 50 million cas h co ntributions in 2012 and 2011 were 80 million and 113 million respectively we anticipate 2014 contributions will be in the range of 10 million to 25 million 

       we expect our ongoing tax rate in 2014 to be in the range of 245 to 255 because of the differences in the tax rates in the countries in which we operate a shift in the geographic mix of earnings will impact our overall ongoing tax rate 

       over the past four years the company used 25 billion of cash to repurchase about 25 million shares of stock and the company ended the year with approximately 22 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorization from the board of directors in january 2014 the company announced that it expects ppgs strong balance sheet and cash position to be supplemented by continued strong free cash flow in 2014 along with the receipt of about 15 billion in aftertax proceeds from the pending sale of its ownership interest in the transitions optical joint venture ppg also announced its intention to deploy between 30 billion and 40 billion of incremental cash over an 18 to 24 month period beginning in january 2014 the focus of this cash deployment is related to incremental earnings accretion initiatives including return of cash to shareholders

performance in 2012 compared with 2011 

  performance overview 

net sales in 2012 increased 359 million or 3 from the prior year to 13512 million primarily due to higher selling prices 3 higher sales volumes 1 and sales from acquired businesses 2 partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact 3 sales volumes varied significantly by region with volume growth in north america of nearly 6 and modest growth in emerging regions european volumes declined 4 versus the prior year period with every coatings business except aerospace experiencing sluggish enduse market conditions improved selling prices were achieved in each of the three coatings segments and optical and specialty materials in our coatings segments higher selling prices were in response to persistent raw material and other cost inflation the unfavorable currency impact was primarily driven by the us dollar strengthening against the euro and latin american currencies 

increased demand was driven by stronger industrial production activity which aided many of our businesses the global industrial recovery varied by region and enduse market in 2012 north american growth was led by strength in the automotive oem aerospace and architectural coatings businesses automotive oem coatings volumes were up year over year outpacing growth in industry demand aerospace coatings enduse market growth has remained strong us architectural coatings growth has been supported by improvement in construction spending as us residential construction improved throughout the year following several anemic years mild weather early in 2012 also aided us architectural coatings volumes sluggish enduse market conditions in europe were largely offset by incremental sales from acquired businesses in the region growth rates in asia in 2012 were reduced by the low level of marine originalequipment new ship builds however aiding growth in asia was strength in china auto production and the packaging business as well as the absence of the thailand floods which particularly impacted optical products in late 2011 higher selling prices in every coatings reportable segment and the optical and specialty materials segment in 2012 were somewhat offset by pricing declines in the glass reportable segment in our coatings segments prices were increased in response to persistent raw material cost inflation the glass segments pricing was down reflecting weaker global fiber glass demand 

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by 40 million or 05 from the prior year to 7905 million primarily due to the cost of sales of acquired businesses the cost of sales associated with the sales volume growth and the negative impact of inflation these increases were largely offset by the impact of currency translation and lower manufacturing costs cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2012 was 585 down from 598 in 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 78 million or 25 from the prior year to 3200 million primarily due to increases from acquired businesses overhead inflation partially offset by the reduction in costs due to the favorable impact of currency translation and the benefit of our restructuring actions these expenses remained flat as a percent of sales at 237 in both 2012 and 2011 reflecting the benefits 

2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 23 

of our continuing effort to aggressively manage our costs even as our sales volume increases 

the 2012 business restructuring charge of 208 million represents the costs associated with a restructuring plan focused on further reducing ppg’s global cost structure the actions included in the restructuring plan delivered pretax cost savings in the second half of 2012 of approximately 50 million 

other charges increased by 161 million from the prior year to 224 million largely due to the 159 million environmental remediation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2012 related primarily to costs at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in jersey city new jersey 

other income decreased by 13 million or 9 from the prior year to 139 million primarily due to 27 million of lower equity earnings primarily from our asian fiber glass joint ventures reflecting demand decline in the consumer electronics market 

the effective tax rate on income before income taxes was approximately 21 in 2012 and 2011 see the regulation g reconciliation below for details of ppgs adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations 

diluted earningspershare for 2012 were 606 comprised of net income from continuing operations of 469 per diluted share and net income from discontinued operations of 137 per diluted share the 2011 diluted earningspershare of 687 was comprised of net income from continuing operations of 540 per diluted share and net income from discontinued operations of 147 per diluted share the increase in diluted earningspershare from continuing operations resulted primarily from higher adjusted income before income taxes and a reduction in the shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases in the second half of 2011 and first quarter of 2012

results of reportable business segments 

for performance coatings 2012 net sales increased 126 million or 3 from the prior year to 4752 million primarily due to higher pricing 4 and sales from acquired businesses 1 partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 2 higher pricing was achieved by all the businesses in the segment reflecting continuing efforts to offset significant inflationary impacts over the past two years yearoveryear segment sales volumes were nearly flat in 2012 with aerospace and architectural coatings business volume growth being offset by automotive refinish and protective and marine coatings business volume declines sales volume in the aerospace business continued to benefit from excellent enduse market growth despite increasingly difficult prior year comparable periods us architectural coatings were aided by early signs of a construction market recovery in the us and mild weather early in 2012 offset by the absence of elevated sales in the prior year from the introduction of a new product in the national account channel volumes declined in the automotive refinish coatings business particularly in europe and in the protective and marine coatings business as lower marine new build volume was somewhat offset by higher volume in protective coatings segment income was 744 million an increase of 71 million or 11 from the prior year segment income improved as lower costs relating to benefits from ppgs restructuring and other cost management actions coupled with the effect from the higher net sales were partly offset by inflation higher selling costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation 

the industrial coatings segment’s net sales increased 221 million or 5 from the prior year to 4379 million primarily due to higher pricing 3 higher sales volumes 4 and net sales from acquired businesses 1 partially offset by 

 

unfavorable foreign currency translation 3 the segment sales volume growth of 4 was driven by automotive oem coatings growth especially in north america due in part to the recovery from the 2011 japanese tsunami as well as continued strength in china offset by european economic weakness the current year volume gains by our automotive oem coatings business outpaced industry growth industrial and packaging coatings volumes were mixed by region europe was weaker in both businesses us industrial coatings improved while emerging region demand varied by enduse with markets aligned with construction activity being down in asia and argentina being impacted by import restrictions the consumer electronics market in asia was slower but packaging volumes in asia improved emerging region sales were supplemented by sales from acquired businesses and the reorganization of our joint venture in india segment income of 590 million increased 152 million or 35 from the prior year as the impact of higher pricing sales volume growth and manufacturing cost savings overcame the adverse impact of inflation and higher overhead costs incurred to support growth restructuring related cost savings also aided segment income in 2012

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement 

as discussed in item 3 and note 14 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 14 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

  as of december 31 2013  and 2012 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 310 million  and 332 million  respectively of which 105 million  and 101 million  respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2013 2012 and 2011 totaled 108 million  166 million and 9 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income cash outlays related to environmental remediation retained by ppg were 120 

 

million  62 million and 48 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters now estimated to be approximately 100 million to 200 million which is lower than the estimate of 100 million to 275 million as of december 31 2012 as a result of the additional environmental remediation charge recorded in the third quarter of 2013 explained below and the separation of the commodity chemicals business such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites including about one third each related to the following i additional costs at new jersey chrome ii legacy glass sites and iii a number of other sites including legacy chemical manufacturing sites the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 

the company continues to analyze assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with new jersey chrome during the third quarter of 2013 ppg completed an assessment of costs incurred to date versus current progress and the potential cost impacts of recently acquired information including but not limited to the extent of impacted soils percentage of hazardous versus nonhazardous soils daily soil excavation rates and engineering administrative and other associated costs based on this assessment a reserve adjustment of 89 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2013

we continue to believe that our cash and short term investments on hand cash from operations and the company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending including acquisitions dividend payments debt service amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement share repurchases

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those  policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 12 “income taxes” and note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 13 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the weighted average discount rate assumption at december 31 2013 and for 2014 is 483 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a change in the discount rate of 100 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would impact 2014 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 18 million and 9 million respectively 

 

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2013 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 725 and will remain the same for 2014 a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points with other assumptions held constant would impact 2014 net periodic pension expense by approximately 27 million 

business combinations 

  in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations the company used the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company used a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property plant and equipment thirdparty actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal environmental and other contingent liabilities the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets 

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually intangibles are tested for impairment using a quantitative impairment model the company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a twostep quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry market and general economic conditions to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and perform a twostep quantitative test fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that a re based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on the 2013 impairment tests none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits business combinations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and

judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013 the us dollar strengthened against certain currencies in the countries in which ppg operates while weakening against others the most notable being the euro as a result consolidated net assets at december 31 2013 decreased by 44 million compared to december 31 2012 comparing exchange rates during 2013 to those of 2012 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was weaker in certain countries which had a favorable impact on full year 2013 income before income taxes of 11 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

the us dollar weakened from yearend december 31 2011 to yearend december 31 2012 against certain currencies in the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling polish zloty and the south korean won a 141 million   increase  in ppg consolidated net assets and shareholders equity resulted from translating ppg’s foreign denominated net assets to us dollars at december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 comparing exchange rates during 2012 to those of 2011 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was generally stronger particularly against the euro which had an unfavorable impact on full year 2012 income before income taxes of approximately 40 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to 

30 2013 ppg annual report and form 10k 

manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 10 “derivative financial instruments and hedging activities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct operations in many countries around the world our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2013 and 2012 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were insignificant the potential reduction in ppg’s income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 would have been 9 million and 14 million respectively 

in 2008 ppg entered into us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 116 billion of which 600 million were to settle on march 15 2013 and 560 million were to settle on march 15 2018 in june 2012 600 million of the swaps with a settlement date of march 15 2013 were settled with ppg receiving 1 million in cash on settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts ppg will receive 560 million us dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts during the term of these contracts ppg will receive semiannual payments in march and september of each year based on us dollar longterm fixed interest rates and ppg will make annual payments in march of each year to the counterparties based on euro longterm fixed interest rates the company designated all of the cross currency swaps as hedges of its net investment in acquired european coatings businesses and as a result the mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps outstanding have been and will be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income aoci and the cash flow impact of these swaps has been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 120 million and 95 million respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by 81 million and 84 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 453 million as of december 31 2013 and 449 million as of december 31 2012 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 53 million and 51 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs at december 31 2011 interest rate swaps with a notional value of 445 million converted fixed rate debt to variable rate debt during 2012 ppg settled these swaps receiving 29 million from such settlements a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately 01 million for the year ended december 31 2012 further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 81 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual income from continuing operations or cash flows 

equity price risk 

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 10 “derivative financial instruments and hedging activities” and note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of december 31 2013 and 2012 was an asset of 207 million and 130 million respectively see note 9 “fair value measurements” a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of 26 million and 19 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses lenses sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials segment brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals segment and sand clay and soda ash in the glass segment many raw material prices began to inflate during 2010 continued through 2011 and into 2012 reflecting recovering economic demand and decreased supply stemming from capacity idled or closed during the recession also adverse effects of supplier disruptions due to natural disasters placed additional pressure on some of our supply chains leading to higher prices raw material prices began to moderate in the second half of 2012 due to lower global demand including the effect of lower economic activity in europe 

coatings raw materials include both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide and generally comprise 70to80 of cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component ppg input prices inflated further in the first half of 2012 and then in the second half of the year moderated modestly from the years peak levels the largest inflationary impact was from titanium dioxide pigments with yearoveryear reductions in the cost of various petrochemicalbased materials partially offsetting those increases raw material costs for our coatings businesses increased nearly 725 million due to inflation during the three year period ended december 31 2012 the inflation rate for 2012 was low singledigit percentages 

energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass segments and our primary energy cost is natural gas ppg has historically purchased 60to70 trillion british thermal units btus of natural gas each year inclusive of the impact of ppg’s natural gas hedging activities ppg’s 2012 natural gas unit cost decreased 35  in the us compared to 2011 reflecting continued higher natural gas supply stemming from the success of shale gas drilling the separation of ppgs commodity chemicals business greatly reduced ppgs natural gas exposure with annual purchases now expected to range from 10to20 trillion btus per year in our commodity chemicals segment we also experienced lower average ethylene unit costs compared to 2011 lower ethane feedstock values partially due to the expansion of shale gas production was the main driver of an approximate 13 decline in our average unit cost of ethylene the separation of ppgs commodity chemicals business also eliminated ppgs direct exposure with respect to the volatility of ethylene prices 

 

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs these initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world the company also has undertaken a strategic initiative with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide as well as to add to the global supply of this raw material ppg possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment and we have and intend to continue to leverage this and engage potential partners to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations joint ventures licensing or other commercial initiatives in 2012 ppg signed a memorandum of understanding with henan billions chemicals co ltd billions by which ppg will license certain chloridebased titanium dioxide technologies to billions for use at billions’ titanium dioxide refinement facilities in china in addition ppg has signed a longterm purchase agreement for titanium dioxide with billions ppg intends to use the chloridebased titanium dioxide manufactured by billions for various enduse applications including paints and other coatings billions is also able to sell the chloridebased titanium dioxide to third parties our efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption resulted in a 4 reduction in titanium dioxide usage during 2012 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals that impact or could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

in 2006 the european union “eu” member states adopted new comprehensive chemical registration legislation known as “reach” registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach applies to all chemical substances manufactured or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more annually and will require the registration of approximately 30000 chemical substances with the european chemicals agency reach requires the registration of these substances entailing the filing of extensive data on their potential risks to human health and the environment registration activities are occurring in three phases over an 11year period based on tonnage and level of concern the first registration deadline was in 2010 with subsequent phases ending in 2013 and 2018 in the case of chemicals with a high level of concern the regulation calls for progressive substitution unless no alternative can be found in these cases authorization of the chemicals will be required 

9 2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 

ppg established a dedicated organization to manage reach implementation we have continued to review our product portfolio worked closely with our suppliers to assure their commitment to register substances in our key raw materials and started registration of substances that ppg manufactures or imports as raw materials we will continue to work with our suppliers to understand the future availability and viability of the raw materials we use in our production processes 

compliance with the reach legislation will result in increased costs related to the registration process product testing and reformulation risk characterization and participation in substance information exchange forums “siefs” required to coordinate registration dossier preparation ppg identified 10 substances that required registration in 2010 and engaged with other key companies through siefs to develop the required registration dossiers actual costs for substance registration were not significant in 2010 through 2012 due primarily to fewer substances requiring registration than originally anticipated the costs for 2013 and 2018 registrations and potential additional future testing in support of 2010 registrations are currently unclear however our current estimate of the total spend during 20132018 has been lowered to a range of 5 million to 10 million we anticipate that some current raw materials and products will be subject to the reach authorization process and believe that we will be able to demonstrate adequate risk management for the use and application of the majority of such substances 

changes to chemical control regulations have been proposed or implemented in many countries beyond the eu including china canada the united states and korea because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time we anticipate chemical control regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with the regulations 

research and development 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 470 million  445 million and 408 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these costs totaled approximately 3  of sales in each year of the period from 2010 to 2012 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes additional process and product research and development work is also undertaken at many of the company’s manufacturing plants as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china we have obtained government funding of a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

 

the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the enduse markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management 

  patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg earned 51 million  in 2012 55 million  in 2011 and 58 million  in 2010 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

backlog 

 in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

nonus operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our sales generated by products sold in the developed and emerging regions of the world over the past three years are summarized below 

seasonality 

ppg’s earnings are typically greater in the second and third quarters and cash flow from operations is greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in north america and europe this higher activity level results in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash flow 

10 2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg at december 31 2012  was 39200  the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 12 million 15 million and 16 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2013 will be in the range of 1015 million excluding the recently separated commodity chemicals business although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

in march of 2011 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” proposed amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for mercury emissions from mercury cell chloralkali plants known as mercury maximum achievable control technology “mercury mact” usepa’s proposed amendments would require improvements in work practices to reduce fugitive emissions and would result in reduced levels of mercury emissions while still allowing the mercury cell facilities to continue to operate prior to the separation of its commodity chemicals business ppg operated a 200 tonperday mercury cell production unit at the natrium wva facility this unit constituted approximately 4 of ppg’s total chloralkali production capacity the mercury mact has no impact on any other ppg facility 

separately the natrium wva facility discharges its wastewater into the ohio river pursuant to a national pollution discharge elimination system “npdes” permit issued by the west virginia department of environmental protection “wvdep” because it discharges into the ohio river the npdes permit terms must conform to pollution control standards for the ohio river set by the ohio river valley water sanitation commission “orsanco” on october 12 2012 orsanco granted ppgs request for a variance which will allow the natrium wva facility to continue to have a mixing zone for its discharge of mercury for a fiveyear period after orsancos prohibition on mixing zones takes effect on october 16 2013 

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 108 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 20 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations 

 

each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

as of december 31 2012 and 2011 ppg had reserves for estimated environmental remediation costs totaling 332 million  and 226 million respectively of which 101 million  and 59 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2012 2011 and 2010 totaled 167 million  16 million and 21 million respectively cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 66 million  59 million and 34 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the impact of foreign currency translation increased the liability by 2 million  in 2012 and decreased the liability by 3 million in 2011 as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed the liability for environmental contingencies was increased by 3 million  in 2012 environmental remediation of a former chromium manufacturing plant site and associated sites in jersey city nj which we refer to as “new jersey chrome” represents the major part of our existing reserves included in the amounts mentioned above were 221 million  and 129 million in reserves at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively associated with all new jersey chromium sites 

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

the company continues to analyze assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with new jersey chrome in connection with the preparation of a final draft soil remedial action work plan and cost estimate that was initially required to be submitted to the njdep in may 2012 but now will be submitted in 2013 the company compiled updated information about the sites that was used to develop a new estimate of the cost to remediate these sites which resulted in a charge against earnings of 145 million in the first quarter of 2012 a charge of 165 million for the estimated costs of remediating these sites was recorded in the third quarter of 2006 information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to njdep in the second quarter of 2014 

 these charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 and 2012 were significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding 2006 and 2012 pretax charges 

2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 11 

against income for environmental remediation have ranged between 10 million and 35 million per year for the past 16 years charges in 2013 are expected to again be within this historical range in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 100 million to 275 million this range of reasonably possible unreserved loss relates to environmental matters at a number of sites including each of the following i additional costs at new jersey chrome which represent about one third of this potential range ii a number of other locations including legacy glass and chemical manufacturing sites and iii the calcasieu river estuary and two operating plant sites in the companys former commodity chemicals business the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 

all known and currently reserved environmental liabilities associated with the commodity chemicals business were transferred with the separation of this business from ppg and subsequent merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of georgia gulf the newly merged company axiall will assume responsibility for these liabilities as a result of this transaction ppg will retain responsibility for potential environmental liabilities that may result from future natural resource damage claims and any potential tort claims at the calcasieu river estuary associated with activities and historical operations of the lake charles la facility ppg will additionally retain responsibility for all liabilities relating to arising out of or resulting from sediment contamination in the ohio river resulting from historical activities and operations at the natrium wva facility 

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs 

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible while ppg has operations in many countries a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place 

as a result of a us supreme court ruling in april 2007 declaring that ghgs are air pollutants covered by the clean air act usepa proposed and later finalized in december 2009 an endangerment finding that ghg emissions “threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations” based on the endangerment finding the usepa proposed 

 

then finalized new “tailored” thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act new source review and title v operating permit programs would be required for new or existing industrial facilities these rules impose new permit requirements on ppg facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year as well as on new equipment installations that will emit more than 75000 tons of ghgs per year the us federal government has committed to a 17 economywide emission reduction target below 2005 levels by 2020 these rules were upheld by a federal appeals court in 2012 in a challenge filed by industry to date no ppg facility in the us has triggered either the 100000 ton or 75000 ton per year permit requirement thresholds ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary carbon disclosure project 

energy prices and availability of supply continue to be a concern for major energy users since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation in 2007 ppg announced corporate targets namely i a reduction in energy intensity by 25 from 2006 to 2016 and ii a 10 absolute reduction in ghg emissions from 2006 to 2011 effective energy management practices led to a 10 reduction in ppgs ghg emissions at the end of 2011 ppg estimates a 50 to 70 reduction in its total annual energy consumption and ghg emissions as a result of the separation of its commodity chemicals business on january 28 2013 new energy intensity and ghg emissions intensity targets have been established to better reflect what will be possible given the portfolio of businesses that remain with ppg with the base year of 2012 and a termination year of 2020 the company has established several new key sustainability metrics 1 an annual energy intensity reduction target of 15 2 an annual ghg emission intensity reduction of 15 3 a hazardous waste to landfill reduction of 20 4 a nonhazardous waste to landfill reduction of 10 5 a 10 reduction in reportable spills 6 a 5 reduction in serious employee injuries and 7 a target of 30 of product sales from sustainable technology these new sustainability goals represent opportunities to reduce costs improve operational efficiencies and support customer needs 

ppg participates in the us department of energy “doe” save energy now leader program reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity in september 2011 the doe changed its approach to energy efficiency in the industrial sector and initiated the better buildings better plants program ppg is currently participating in this new program which sets energy savings targets and provides a suite of educational training and technical resources to help meet those targets recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area 

in december 2012 after lengthy challenges and reproposals the usepa issued its final clean air act emissions standards for large and small boilers and incinerators that burn fossil fuels known as the boiler maximum achievable control technology “boiler mact” regulations these regulations 

12 2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 

are aimed at controlling emissions of air toxics and will regulate emissions of particulate matter carbon monoxide mercury dioxin and hydrogen chloride from boilers requiring that covered facilities achieve compliance within three years there are 13 ppg facilities that are subject to these regulations the facility most impacted by these regulations is the 115 megawatt coal fired power plant at the natrium w va chloralkali facility that was part of the commodity chemicals business that was separated as of january 28 2013 the other 12 facilities have natural gasfired boilers which are subject to minimal regulatory oversight in the final rule requiring only routine and reasonable maintenance and recordkeeping and need no addon pollution control equipment facilities must achieve compliance with these regulations by early 2016 the cost impact for ppgs remaining affected facilities is not expected to be significant

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings optical and specialty materials and glass products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations 

  

 

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials coatings raw materials both organic primarily petroleum based materials and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide generally comprise between 70to80 of cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component ppg input prices inflated further in the first half of 2012 continuing the trend of 2010 and 2011 and then in the second half of the year moderated modestly from the years peak levels the largest inflationary impact related to the cost of titanium dioxide pigments with yearoveryear reductions in the costs for various petrochemicalbased materials countering those increases raw material costs for our coatings businesses increased nearly 725 million due to inflation during the three year period ended december 31 2012 the inflation rate for 2012 was low singledigit percentages 

we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins are at risk of being lowered 

most of the raw materials used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts procuring from multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs these initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and strategic initiatives with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide and other materials 

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during 2010 the global economy began to mend from the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009 however the pace of recovery was uneven beginning in 2011 overall activity levels in most major global economies and in most enduse markets exhibited yearoveryear growth during 2012 overall activity levels varied greatly among the major global economies with similar differences experienced among the various coatings enduse markets because of this variation overall aggregate ppg global volume grew modestly for the year with some deviation from quartertoquarter entering 

2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 13 

2013 the disparity of economic activity by region and end use market is anticipated to continue of the major regions growth prospects remain in north america bolstered by further anticipated recovery in construction activity and continued strength in various industrial markets including automotive production and increased investment related to the energy and chemical industries however concerns over fiscal uncertainty and unemployment temper these prospects somewhat the 2013 growth rate in emerging regions is expected to remain mixed but improve somewhat based on increases in local consumption less inventory destocking associated with lower exports and government stimulus actions the eurozone is expected to remain subdued with very few enduse markets expected to deliver growth and downside risk to regional economic conditions remains 

ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets and in many geographies this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any significant or rapid decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced earnings and cash flows 

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and regulate various health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to including those in the united states as well as in other countries in which we operate impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as described in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our facilities and properties the cost of which is substantial we have accrued a 332 million  liability for estimated environmental remediation costs at december 31 2012  our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation if necessary of such environmental contingencies and the potential for technological and regulatory developments as such in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 100 million to 275 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

 

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

for over 30 years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them 

new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could 

14 2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 

potentially impact i the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor ii our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2012 by products sold outside the us was approximately 57  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies could materially affect our financial results 

as a producer of coatings and specialty materials we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature 

we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner however these materials if mishandled or released into the environment could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us the separation of the commodity chemicals business on january 28 2013 significantly reduces the volumes of these materials that we handle and transport 

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages work stoppages natural disasters and severe weather events computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the 

 

cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses 

in the past 15 years ppg has completed over 50 acquisitions to further the growth of the company and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future as part of our growth strategy of particular note ppg agreed in december 2012 to purchase the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel nv upon closing this acquisition will add approximately 600 stores and eight manufacturing facilities to ppgs north american coatings operations growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks including 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may 

 

contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

the results of any future litigation and the above lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

for over 30 years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed asbestos settlement arrangement see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

in the past the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

ppg received a consolidated compliance order and notice of proposed penalty “conopp” from the louisiana department of environmental quality “ldeq” in february 2006 alleging violation of various requirements of its lake charles la facility’s air permit based largely upon permit deviations selfreported by ppg the conopp did not contain a proposed civil penalty ppg filed a request for hearing and has engaged ldeq in settlement discussions since 2006 ppg has held discussions with ldeq to try to resolve the conopp in late 2012 ppg increased the offer to settle the conopp for a total of 400000 plus the performance of two beneficial environmental projects with an expenditure for those projects to be at least 220000 this increased offer was accepted by the ldeq in the fourth quarter of 2012 all known and currently reserved environmental liabilities associated with the commodity chemicals business were transferred with the separation of this business from ppg and subsequent merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of georgia gulf the newly merged company axiall will assume responsibility for these liabilities

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of 

 

financial condition and results of operations 

separation of ppgs commodity chemicals business and merger of that business with georgia gulf corporation and agreement to acquire the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel nv 

recently ppg took two major steps in its strategic transformation into a more focused coatings and specialty materials company 

on january 28 2013 ppg completed the separation of its commodity chemicals business and the merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of the georgia gulf corporation georgia gulf the combined company formed by uniting georgia gulf with ppgs former commodity chemicals business is named axiall corporation ppg holds no ownership interest in axiall corporation refer to note 25 separation and merger transaction under item 8 of this form 10k for financial information relating to this transaction 

in addition in december 2012 ppg entered into an agreement to acquire the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel nv in a deal valued at 105 billion the acquisition which is currently expected to close in the first half of 2013 includes the acquisition of a number of leading brands and approximately 600 paint stores in the united states canada and the caribbean with regard to this pending acquisition the statutory waiting period prescribed by the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended expired on february 1 2013 canadian competition clearance and investment canada act approval remain pending 

performance in 2012 compared with 2011 

performance overview 

net sales in 2012 totaled 15200 million  compared to 14885 million  in 2011 an increase of 2  higher selling prices increased sales 2  higher volumes increased sales 1  and acquisitions contributed 2  to sales these increases were partially offset by 3  from negative foreign currency impact sales volumes varied significantly by region with volume growth in north america of nearly 5 and modest growth in emerging regions european volumes declined 4 versus the prior year period with every coatings business except aerospace experiencing sluggish enduse market conditions improved selling prices were achieved in each of the three coatings segments and optical and specialty materials in our coatings segments higher selling prices were in response to persistent raw material and other cost inflation the unfavorable currency impact was primarily driven by the us dollar strengthening against the euro and latin american currencies 

increased demand was driven by stronger industrial production activity which aided many of our businesses the global industrial recovery varied by region and end use market in 2012 north american growth was led by strength in the automotive oem aerospace and architectural coatings businesses automotive oem coatings volumes were up year over year outpacing growth in industry demand aerospace coatings enduse market growth has remained strong us architectural coatings growth has been supported by 

18 2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 

improvement in construction spending as us residential construction improved throughout the year following several anemic years mild weather early in 2012 also aided us architectural coatings volumes sluggish enduse market conditions in europe were largely offset by incremental sales from acquired businesses in the region growth rates in asia in 2012 were reduced by the low level of marine originalequipment new ship builds however aiding growth in asia was strength in china auto production and the packaging business as well as the absence of the thailand floods which particularly impacted optical products in late 2011 higher selling prices in every coatings reportable segment and the optical and specialty materials segment in 2012 were somewhat offset by pricing declines in commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments in our coatings segments prices were increased in response to persistent raw material cost inflation the commodity chemicals segments pricing declines reflect lower chlorine pricing offset partially by higher caustic pricing reflecting solid demand and low caustic inventory levels throughout the year the glass segments pricing was down reflecting weaker global fiber glass demand 

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased by 12 million  in 2012 to 9069 million  compared to 9081 million  for 2011 the decrease was due to the impact of currency translation and lower manufacturing costs these decreases were largely offset by the cost of sales of acquired businesses the cost of sales associated with the sales volume growth and the negative impact of inflation cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2012 was 597  down from 610  in 2011 the pricing for the company’s input costs varied as coatings input costs increased however lower natural gas and ethylene pricing aided our commodity chemicals segment 

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 101 million  in 2012 to 3335 million  as compared to 2011 the increase was due to increases from acquisitions overhead inflation and higher costs to support the sales volume growth offset partially by the reduction in costs due to the impact of currency translation and the benefit of our restructuring actions these expenses remained relatively flat as a percent of sales at 219  in 2012 and 217  in 2011 reflecting the benefits of our continuing effort to aggressively manage our costs even as our sales volume increases 

the business restructuring charge of 208 million in 2012 represents the costs associated with a restructuring plan focused on further reducing ppg’s global cost structure the actions included in the restructuring plan delivered pretax cost savings in the second half of 2012 of approximately 50 million and an additional savings of 80 million expected in 2013 the savings are expected to grow to an annual run rate of about 140 million following completion of these actions in 2013 

other charges increased to 232 million  in 2012 as compared to 73 million  in 2011 due largely to the 159 million environmental remediation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2012 related primarily to costs at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in jersey city new jersey 

other earnings decreased to 149 million  in 2012 as compared to 177 million  in 2011 this decrease was primarily 

 

due to 26 million of lower equity earnings primarily from our asian fiber glass joint ventures reflecting demand decline in the consumer electronics market 

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings was approximately 24 in 2012 and 2011 the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 includes tax benefits of 60 million or approximately 38 on the 159 million charge for environmental remediation costs 45 million or approximately 21 on the 208 million business restructuring charge 2 million or approximately 29 for expenses of 6 million stemming from the acquisition of dyrup as in europe and colpisa in latin america and 3 million or 11 on certain business separation and acquisition related costs of 26 million the 2011 rate includes a benefit of 12 million resulting from a favorable tax audit settlement the 2011 rate also includes the impact of the nontaxable bargain purchase gain resulting from the equachlor acquisition the effective tax rate on the remaining pretax earnings was 25 in 2012 and 2011 

diluted earningspershare for 2012 were 606 excluding the charges related to business restructuring and environmental remediation acquisitionrelated costs and the costs related to the separation and merger transaction adjusted diluted earningsper share for 2012 were 794 this compares to the 2011 diluted earningspershare of 687 the increase in diluted earningspershare resulted primarily from higher adjusted income before income taxes and a reduction in the shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases in the second half of 2011 and first quarter of 2012 average shares used to calculate earnings per share – assuming dilution were 1551 million in 2012 and 1593 million in 2011 

regulation g reconciliation  results from operations 

ppg industries believes investors’ understanding of the company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of income before income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for nonrecurring charges ppg’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on an ongoing basis income before income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered a substitute for income before income taxes net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with us gaap in addition adjusted income before income taxes adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies

results of reportable business segments 



  

for performance coatings 2012 sales were 48 billion  126 million  or 3  higher than 2011 the sales increase was comprised of 4  due to price partially offset by a 2  decline due to the impact of foreign currency translation sales from acquired businesses contributed 1  to growth higher pricing was achieved by all the businesses in the segment reflecting continuing efforts to offset significant inflationary impacts over the past two years yearoveryear segment sales volumes were nearly flat in 2012 with aerospace and architectural coatings business volume growth being offset by automotive refinish and protective and marine coatings business volume declines sales volume in the aerospace business continued to benefit from excellent enduse market growth despite increasingly difficult prior year comparable periods us architectural coatings were aided by early signs of a construction market recovery in the us and mild weather early in 2012 offset by the absence of elevated sales in the prior year from the introduction of a new 

 

product in the national account channel volumes declined in the automotive refinish coatings business particularly in europe and in the protective and marine coatings business as lower marine new build volume was somewhat offset by higher volume in protective coatings segment earnings grew to 744 million  a 71 million  or 11  improvement over prior year earnings improved as lower costs relating to benefits from ppgs restructuring and other cost management actions coupled with the effect from the higher sales were partly offset by inflation higher selling costs and the negative impact of foreign currency 

looking ahead to the first quarter 2013 aerospace sales growth is expected to continue despite more difficult comparison periods due to consecutive years of good industry growth challenging marine newbuild conditions remain and favorable weather conditions during the first quarter 2012 present a difficult comparable period for us architectural coatings lastly the segment is expected to benefit from incremental savings from the previously announced restructuring program and currencytranslation impacts are expected to be minimal given current exchange rates 

the industrial coatings segment’s sales increased to 44 billion  up 5  from the prior year the sales increase was comprised of 3  due to price and 4  due to volume offset by a 3  decrease due to currency translation sales from acquisitions contributed 1  to the increase the segment sales volume growth of 4  was driven by automotive oem coatings growth especially in north america due in part to the recovery from the 2011 japanese tsunami as well as continued strength in china offset by european economic weakness the current year volume gains by our automotive oem coatings business outpaced industry growth industrial and packaging coatings volumes were mixed by region europe was weaker in both businesses us industrial coatings improved while emerging region demand varied by enduse with markets aligned with construction activity being down in asia and argentina being impacted by import restrictions the consumer electronics market in asia was slower but packaging volumes in asia improved emerging region sales were supplemented by sales from acquired businesses and the reorganization of our joint venture in india segment earnings of 590 million  increased 152 million  as the impact of higher pricing sales volume growth and manufacturing cost savings overcame the adverse impact of inflation and higher overhead costs incurred to support growth restructuring related cost savings also aided earnings in 2012 

looking ahead to the first quarter 2013 higher yearoveryear general industrial activity is expected globally aided by modest anticipated improvement in asia global automotive oem vehicle production is expected to be flat versus robust 2012 results reflecting less global inventory build and a more severe negative impact from lower european auto builds however ppg share gains are expected to continue in this business ongoing ppg costmanagement actions are expected to continue including incremental benefits from the 2012 restructuring program lastly currency translation impact is expected to be muted based on current exchange rates 

architectural coatings – emea segment sales were 2147 million  in 2012 up 43 million  or 2  versus 2011 the 

20 2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 

acquisition of dyrup in january 2012 contributed 8  sales growth however sales were negatively impacted by 7  due to the impact of foreign currency translation pricing increased sales midsingle digit percents which was substantially offset by volume declines due to market weakness throughout the region segment earnings increased 22 million  to 145 million  due to lower costs stemming from aggressive ongoing cost management and supplemented by the cost benefits from ppgs restructuring actions and higher pricing   these earnings improvements were reduced by the impact of lower sales volumes and cost inflation in addition negative currency translation impact of 13 million  was largely offset by the absence of a 9 million charge in the prior year related to a customer bankruptcy 

looking ahead we expect overall market conditions to remain challenging in the region as we begin 2013 implementation of previously announced restructuring actions continues with expanded benefits expected in the first quarter and full year 2013 currency translation impacts which have been a significant headwind for the segment are expected to be minimal in the first quarter 

optical and specialty materials segment 2012 sales were 12 billion  essentially flat with sales in 2011 a 3  unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was offset by a 1  price increase and 2  volume growth optical products achieved sales volume growth with the majority due to higher transitions® lens market penetration volumes were also aided by the absence of the prior year negative impacts from extensive thailand flooding that disrupted optical customers and supply chains in the fourth quarter 2011 silicas volumes were down modestly year over year segment earnings grew by 7  to 348 million  as earnings improved in both businesses the increase in earnings is primarily due to higher sales volumes overhead and manufacturing cost improvements including restructuring cost savings and higher pricing earnings were reduced by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and inflation 

looking ahead the absence of a segment sales recovery stemming from the 2011 thailand flooding is expected to be somewhat offset in the first quarter 2013 with the favorable impact from the new generation vii transitions product introduction modest silica demand growth is expected to continue currency impacts are expected to be negligible based on current exchange rates 

as previously disclosed ppg is currently in discussions with essilor relating to the future of ppg’s and essilor’s joint venture transitions optical ppg cannot predict the outcome of the discussions with essilor with respect to the future of transitions optical however ppg believes that possible outcomes may include 1 a modification of the current joint venture structure 2 a sale of all or a portion of ppgs interests in transitions optical to essilor or 3 a sale of all or a portion of essilors interests in transitions optical to ppg ppg cannot predict the timing of its discussions with essilor but expects that these discussions are likely to continue over the next several months 

commodity chemicals segment sales in 2012 versus the prior year declined by 44 million  to 1688 million  while earnings increased 2 million  to 372 million  sales decreased 

 

due to lower chlorine selling prices in each quarter outpacing higher yearoveryear caustic pricing achieved in each quarter this year these price declines were offset partially by higher year over year chlorine and caustic volumes as well as by the favorable sales impact of the may 2011 acquisition of equachlor segment income was up slightly as the impact on earnings of lower pricing was offset by lower energy primarily natural gas and raw material costs lower manufacturing costs also benefited earnings segment earnings were negatively affected by approximately 5 million stemming from the two unplanned production outages late in 2012 

looking forward ppg will report results for the commodity chemicals segment in discontinued operations in 2013 following the completion of the separation of its commodity chemicals business and the merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of georgia gulf corporation which occurred on january 28 2013 

glass segment 2012 sales were 10 billion  down 29 million  or 3  the sales decrease was comprised of 3  due to price and 1  due to currency offset by higher sales volumes of 1  improved flat glass volumes as a result of increased demand in the commercial and solar markets were substantially offset by lower fiber glass volume fiber glass volumes have declined due to weak demand in europe versus a strong prior year comparable period lower pricing in both businesses and the negative impact of currency translation drove the sales decline segment earnings declined to 63 million  compared to 97 million  a year ago lower pricing cost inflation as well as lower equity earnings primarily related to our fiber glass joint venture selling to the consumer electronics industry contributed to the earnings decline these factors were only partially offset with improved flat glass volumes and improved manufacturing cost performance in fiber glass 

looking ahead to the first quarter 2013 fiber glass volumes are expected to remain consistent with lower 2012 results recent positive flat glass volume trends are expected to continue equity earnings are expected to remain at lower levels compared with stronger comparable levels in the beginning of 2012 both businesses remain focused on cost management 

outlook 

during 2012 overall activity levels varied greatly among the major global economies with similar variations in activity level experienced by the major coatings enduse markets because of these variations overall aggregate ppg global volume grew modestly for the year 

for ppg north american demand was the most stable with growth occurring across most enduse markets overall industrial growth continued aided by declining natural gas costs and further expansion in industries such as aerospace where growth continued also further strengthening occurred throughout the year in automotive oem production as the industry continues to recover but activity still remains below prerecession production levels regional growth was also supported by a longawaited improvement in construction spending as us residential construction improved throughout the year following several anemic years moderating growth in the region was continued uncertainty relating to the longterm 

2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 21 

fiscal direction of the federal and state governments despite these limitations and persistently high us unemployment rates the region delivered solid growth during the year and remains the region with the most promising growth prospects for ppg heading into 2013 

during 2012 the european economy continued to underperform versus most other major economies as elevated regional concerns continued regarding government budget deficits and refinancing of government debt loads anxiety rose in the middle of year due to several political elections and associated concerns over the implementation of austerity programs to address fiscal deficits export growth from the region which had been one of the few positive economic factors began to erode reflecting a slowdown in emerging regions growth rates and placing further economic restraint on the eurozone yearoveryear activity levels in the region remained negative throughout the year and demonstrated no meaningful signs of improvement as 2012 came to conclusion 

in the aggregate emerging region economies continued to expand during 2012 but at a much lower level than recent history and with considerable variation by individual country and also by industry within countries ppgs largest emerging region exposure remains asia where annual sales are approaching 30 billion approximately 40 of the companys asian sales are in china which now represents ppgs third largest individual country in terms of sales activity in china and more broadly asia moderated in 2012 with solid growth realized in certain industrial markets including increased automotive production these advances were partly offset by considerable declines in other markets due in large part to decreased global demand in such markets as consumer electronics and marine newbuild as the majority of the global production in these markets occurs in asia demand in the latin american economies was also erratic reflecting in part heavy annual inflation rates the past few years and lower demand for commodities ppgs latin american volumes fell reflecting the weaker regional performance and certain company specific actions to reduce our operations in certain markets and countries based on lower profitability expectations 

as a proactive response to the mixed global enduse market conditions and particularly the lower european demand ppg initiated a restructuring program in early 2012 to reduce its cost structure the earnings charge associated with the program which was focused on our european operations was just over 200 million including about 160 million in cash costs resultant program savings of 140 million annually are expected including approximately 50 million achieved during 2012 the remainder of the savings are anticipated to be achieved in 2013 

since mid2010 commodity and oil prices have experienced inflation due to tight supply stemming from manufacturing capacity remaining idled or removed from service during the recession and improving demand for commodities ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials used in many of our businesses factors which impact our input prices are supplydemand imbalances global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories ppg input prices inflated further in the first half of 2012 and then in the second half of the year moderated 

 

modestly from the years peak levels our current forecast for the early portion of 2013 is for overall coatings raw material prices to be flat with yearend 2012 but results will be mixed based on the respective commodity given the volatility in supplydemand energy cost and the currency environment it is not feasible to project fullyear 2013 raw material pricing 

changes in natural gas pricing have a significant impact on the financial performance of our commodity chemicals and glass segments our 2012 us natural gas costs averaged approximately 300 per mmbtu for the year while our 2011 costs averaged about 465 per unit through 2012 each onedollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million british thermal units had a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs the separation of ppgs commodity chemical business in january 2013 greatly reduced ppgs natural gas exposure reducing the impact of each onedollar change in input cost to about 10 million to 20 million in annual costs despite the reduced annual requirement we will continue to use a variety of techniques to manage these costs which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging 

in an effort to offset the adverse impact of cost inflation on earnings during 2011 and 2012 higher coatings selling prices were implemented in 2012 the higher selling prices reflected efforts to counteract 2012 inflation as well as absorb 2011 inflation which was not fully offset by higher pricing in that year in 2013 additional targeted pricing is expected to be implemented in our businesses which remain impacted by the cost inflation selling prices in commodity chemicals and glass declined modestly during 2012 

pension and postretirement benefit costs were 260 million in 2012 these costs included about 25 million associated with the commodity chemicals segment in 2013 pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to decline roughly 40 million due to strong pension asset performance in 2012 and because ppg will no longer bear the costs associated with the commodity chemicals segment as a result of the separation of that business during 2012 ppgs cash contributions to pension plans totaled 81 million following cash contributions of 121 and 340 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively we anticipate 2013 contributions will be in the range of 75 million to 100 million 

we expect our ongoing tax rate in 2013 to be in the range of 235 to 245 lower than the 2012 rate due to the absence of commodity chemical segment earnings which were primarily us based the us remains one of the companys highest taxed countries because of the differences in country tax rates a shift in the geographic mix of earnings will impact our overall ongoing tax rate 

the company generated cash from operations during 2012 of about 18 billion a record level of performance for the company the company entered 2013 with about 24 billion in cash and shortterm investments which is an historically high level for the company during 2012 ppg completed the acquisitions of dyrup colpisa and spraylat with the annual sales of these businesses approximating 400 million ppg also announced the acquisition of akzo nobels north american

architectural coatings business in december 2012 which is expected to close in the first half of 2013 over the past three years the company has repurchased about 19 million shares of stock at a cost of 15 billion and the company ended the year with approximately 8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorization from the board of directors we anticipate making additional acquisitions and share repurchases in 2013 as we target earnings accretive deployment of our strong cash position 

entering 2013 the disparity of economic activity by region is anticipated to continue of the major regions growth prospects remain in north america bolstered by further anticipated recovery in construction activity and continued strength in various industrial markets including automotive production and increased investment related to the energy and chemical industries however concerns over fiscal uncertainty and unemployment temper these prospects somewhat the 2013 growth rate in emerging regions is expected to remain mixed but improve somewhat based on increases in local consumption less inventory destocking associated with lower exports and government stimulus actions economic activity in the eurozone is expected to remain subdued with very few enduse markets expected to deliver growth with downside risk from regional economic conditions continuing 

ppg intends to remain proactive in managing our businesses to address these varied market conditions and economic uncertainty by maintaining strict operating cost management policies which coupled with the anticipated restructuring savings are expected to temper the impact of any negative market conditions on our business margins

performance in 2011 compared with 2010 

  performance overview 

net sales in 2011 totaled 14885 million compared to 13423 million in 2010 an increase of 11 higher volumes contributed just over 2 and higher selling prices increased sales by 5 the remainder of the sales increase was due to the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions the higher sales volumes were achieved in all major geographic regions while four reportable segments had increased volume levels and the other two had level yearoveryear volumes 

increased demand was driven by stronger global industrial production activity which aided many of our businesses the global industrial recovery continued in 2011 with solid growth in emerging regions and north america and with modest improvement in europe despite a slight decline in volume in the second half of 2011 due to reduced enduse market demand for fiber glass and automotive refinish based on softness in the 

 

region growth rates in asia in 2011 were reduced by the shrinking level of marine originalequipment new ship builds growth was impacted early in the year due to the effects of the japanese earthquake and tsunami and was also tempered late in the year by the negative sales impact stemming from the thailand floods particularly in optical products north american growth was impacted by unscheduled production outages in the commodity chemicals segment earlier in 2011 as well as decreased chlorine industry demand in the fourth quarter activity in construction markets in the developed regions of the world remained at low levels and has not demonstrated any consistent improvement our volume growth for 2011 versus the prior year growth which benefited from increasing demand as the global industrial economy began to recover from the recession also volumes were flat in the fourth quarter of 2011 as customers curtailed their inventory and were cautious with their order patterns reflecting economic uncertainty the improved selling prices in 2011 were achieved in every reporting segment led by commodity chemicals and each of the three coatings segments the commodity chemicals segment achieved pricing gains due to continued strong demand and tightening supply of caustic soda in our coatings segments prices were raised in response to persistent raw material cost inflation the higher coatings selling prices significantly but did not fully offset the impact of raw material inflation rates that began to flatten in the fourth quarter the favorable currency impact was primarily driven by strengthening european asian and latin american currencies against the us dollar compared to 2010 despite a decline in the value of the euro in the second half of 2011 

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by 867 million in 2011 to 9081 million compared to 8214 million in 2010 about 55 of the increase was driven by inflation particularly increases in raw material costs primarily in our coatings businesses manufacturing costs were again positive in 2011 additionally about 20 of the increase in cost of sales was due to sales growth from volume and acquisitions the effect of foreign currency accounts for about 25 of the increase in cost of sales for the year cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 610 in 2011 compared to 612 in 2010 this improvement reflects a combination of slightly higher margins on the sales volume growth in 2011 due to improved product mix and the benefit of selling price increases particularly in commodity chemicals net of the impact of inflation on cost of sales for the coatings businesses higher pricing significantly offset inflation as raw material costs escalated throughout 2011 however the coatings businesses did not fully offset raw material cost inflation with higher pricing in 2011 and additional pricing actions are underway in 2012 in several businesses to further counter inflation absorbed in 2011 for the company in total inflation was more than offset by higher pricing aided by commodity chemicals 

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 255 million to 3234 million in 2011 compared to 2979 million in 2010 the effects of foreign currency inflation and growth in costs to support the increased sales volumes and acquisitions were approximately equal selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were 217 in 2011 down from 222 in 2010 reflecting the benefit of our 

2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 23 

continuing effort to aggressively manage our cost growth as our sales volume increases 

interest expense increased 21 million to 210 million in 2011 from 189 million in 2010 this increase was driven by the company’s 1 billion debt issuance in november of 2010 partially offset by an early repayment of 400 million in term loans in june 2011 interest income increased 8 million to 42 million in 2011 from 34 million in 2010 due to higher average short term investment balances in 2011 compared to 2010 

other charges decreased 11 million to 73 million in 2011 from 84 million in 2010 due principally to the absence of a 6 million antitrust litigation settlement charge which occurred in 2010 and lower environmental remediation expense in 2011 of 5 million 

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2011 was approximately 24 compared to approximately 32 in 2010 the 2011 rate includes a benefit of 12 million resulting from a favorable tax audit settlement the 2011 rate also includes the impact of the nontaxable bargain purchase gain resulting from the equachlor acquisition the effective rate was 25 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2011 

the 2010 tax rate includes expense of 85 million resulting from the reduction of our previously provided deferred tax asset related to our liability for retiree medical costs the deferred tax asset needed to be reduced because the healthcare legislation enacted in march 2010 included a provision that reduced the amount of retiree medical costs that will be deductible after december 31 2012 the 2010 rate also included a 5 million benefit as a result of enacted changes in statutory tax rates outside the us the effective rate was 26 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010 the decrease in the tax rate on the remaining pretax earnings in 2011 is mainly the result of tax planning initiatives in the fourth quarter 

net income attributable to ppg and earnings per share – assuming dilution attributable to ppg for 2011 and 2010 are summarized below 

average shares used to calculate earnings per share – assuming dilution were 1573 million in 2011 and 1645 million in 2010 the reduction is the result of share buyback activity in 2011 

 

results of reportable business segments 

performance coatings sales increased 345 million or 8 to 4626 million in 2011 the sales increase was comprised of 5 due to price and 3 due to currency volumes for the segment were slightly favorable as volume increases in automotive refinish and aerospace were offset by lowsingle digit percentage volume declines in the protective and marine coatings and the architecturalamericas and asia pacific coatings businesses aerospace volumes continued to grow reflecting robust industry demand and ppg share gains automotive refinish volume increased but growth was impacted by customer inventory management at yearend and weaker european activity levels in the second half of the year marine coatings volumes were down reflecting the decline in ship build activity and reduced global shipping during the last quarter of 2011 improved protective coatings volumes in most regions reflecting higher energy and infrastructure demand partly offset the sales decline in marine us architectural coatings volumes were relatively flat this included the severely negative volume trends in the us early in 2011 due to weather conditions architectural volumes in the emerging regions declined low single digit percentages including the negative impacts from lower demand near the end of 2011 segment income in 2011 increased 12 million to 673 million the impacts of improved volumes in automotive refinish and aerospace manufacturing cost reductions and favorable currency impacts more than offset the negative impact of inflation net of price to result in the earnings improvement in 2011 compared to 2010 pricing improved in all businesses reflecting our continuing efforts to address persistent input cost inflation 

industrial coatings sales increased 450 million or 12 compared to 2010 to 4158 million the sales increase was comprised of 5 due to volume 4 due to price and 3 due to currency segment income improved 16 versus 2010 to 438 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased volumes lower manufacturing costs and currency partially offset by the negative impact of inflation net of increases in selling prices and growthdriven increases in overhead costs segment volume grew by 5 on solid global industrial demand with positive results in all three business units growth rates were robust in asia as a result of continued growth in the region for all three businesses the automotive oem business delivered strong singledigit percentage growth reflecting high growth rates due to the automotive industry recovery with continued growth in north america asia pacific and latin america and low growth in europe where volumes were positive for the full year but weakened in the second half of the year global volumes in the industrial and packaging businesses were also favorable with asia pacific the strongest region delivering the majority of the growth with somewhat lower or even declining

volumes in europe and north america due in part to late year customer destocking   

architectural coatings  emea sales increased 230 million or 12 to 2104 million in 2011 the sales increase was comprised of 5 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation a 1 increase from acquired business and the remainder from an increase in selling prices and volume gains segment earnings were up 10 million compared to the prior year positive yearoveryear earnings resulted from the earnings impact of volume growth and currency translation earnings in 2011 were reduced by a 9 million charge related to a ukbased retail doityourself customer who filed for bankruptcy during the second quarter of 2011 and the adverse impact of inflation net of price increases 

optical and specialty materials sales for 2011 increased 63 million or 6 compared to 2010 to 1204 million due to a 2 increase in volumes pricing and the favorable impact of currency earnings grew by 6 to 326 million both optical products and silicas achieved sales growth coming from higher volumes pricing and the impact of currency the silicas business’ volumes benefited from the higher automotive oem production resulting in increased demand for our products sold into the tire and battery markets segment results were tempered by the negative impact from the serious flooding in thailand that disrupted optical customers and supply chains the flooding also impacted production of ppg’s optical materials resulting in a declaration of force majeure during the fourth quarter segment earnings increased due to the factors increasing sales which exceeded the impact of inflation higher manufacturing costs and volume driven growth in overhead cost 

commodity chemicals sales in 2011 versus the prior year increased 298 million or 21 to 1732 million higher pricing and the impact of the equachlor acquisition were the key factors producing the improved sales and earnings segment earnings increased 181 million to 370 million in 2011 capacity utilization was lower in the second third and fourth quarters due to planned and unplanned production outages as well as lower chlorine industry demand in the fourth quarter due to customer inventory management and lower chlorine derivative exports resulting in higher manufacturing and maintenance expenses natural gas unit costs were lower yearoveryear but ethylene costs were higher an increase in overhead costs was substantially offset by gains from asset sales primarily related to the lease of marcellus shale natural gas drilling rights on ppg owned property and lower environmental expense 

glass sales increased 76 million or 8 compared to 2010 to 1061 million in 2011 sales increased 4 due to pricing 2 due to volume growth with the remainder attributable to favorable foreign currency impacts solid fiber glass pricing gains drove the sales growth together with improved flat glass volumes fiber glass volumes were also up over 2010 but were lower in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to lower european demand segment earnings grew to 97 million compared to 74 million a year ago higher sales prices and volumes were the primary drivers of the earnings improvement the earnings results were tempered somewhat by raw material cost inflation higher fiber glass maintenance costs and higher overhead costs

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement 

as discussed in item 3 and note 15 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 15 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

  as of december 31 2012  and 2011 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 332 million  and 226 million  respectively of which 101 million  and 59 million  respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2012 2011 and 2010 totaled 167 million  16 million and 21 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 66 million  59 million and 34 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the impact of foreign currency increased the liability by 2 million  in 2012 and decreased the liability by 3 million  in 2011 as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed the liability for environmental contingencies was increased by 3 million  during 2012 

  in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 100 million to 275 million this range is less than the comparable amount reported at the end of 2011 as a result of 

2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 25 

the additional environmental remediation charge recorded in the first quarter 2012 such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence this range of reasonably possible unreserved loss relates to environmental matters at a number of sites including each of the following i additional costs at new jersey chrome which represents about one third of this potential range ii a number of other sites including legacy glass and chemical manufacturing sites and iii the calcasieu river estuary and two operating plant sites in the companys former commodity chemicals business the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 

the company continues to analyze assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with new jersey chrome in connection with the preparation of a final draft soil remedial action work plan and cost estimate that was initially required to be submitted to the njdep in may 2012 but now will be submitted in 2013 the company compiled updated information about the sites that was used to develop a new estimate of the cost to remediate these sites which resulted in a charge against earnings of 145 million in the first quarter of 2012 a charge of 165 million for the estimated costs of remediating these sites was recorded in the third quarter of 2006 information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to njdep in the second quarter of 2014 there are currently no amounts reserved for groundwater remediation these charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 and 2012 were significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding 2006 and 2012 pretax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between 10 million and 35 million per year for the past 16 years charges in 2013 are expected to again be within this historical range 

impact of inflation 

coatings raw materials both organic primarily petroleum based and inorganic materials including titanium dioxide generally comprise 70to80 of coatings cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component ppg input prices inflated further in the first half of 2012 and then in the second half of the year moderated modestly from the years peak levels in 2012 ppg experienced a reduction in the price of natural gas its primary energy cost and also in ethylene a commodity chemical raw material and experienced low single digit percentage inflation in coatings raw material prices 

in 2011 ppg experienced a reduction in the price of natural gas its primary energy cost but experienced a significant rise in both ethylene a commodity chemical raw material and in coatings raw material prices in 2011 overall coatings raw material costs inflated by approximately10to12 for the company the largest inflation impacts were from titanium dioxide pigments and certain propylenebased resins this impact was not entirely offset by higher selling prices in our performance coatings and architectural coatings – emea 

 

reportable segments there was also a coverage gap in our industrial coatings reportable segment even with this segment using product reformulations to attempt to counter this impact our commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments were able to more than fully offset the impact of inflation with price increases while inflation was not significant for our optical and specialty materials reportable segment 

in 2010 ppg experienced a reduction in its primary energy costs but a steady increase in its coatings raw material costs most notably in the second half of the year this was driven by higher global demand as a result of the gradual recovery in the global economy and tightness of supply as suppliers have not increased their capacities this impact was offset by higher selling prices in our performance coatings and architectural coatings – emea reportable segments and partially offset in our industrial coatings reportable segment industrial coatings partially addressed the remaining impact of raw material inflation with further cost reductions in 2010 the impact of inflation net of price was positive in the optical and specialty materials reportable segment and negative in the commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments 

our current forecast for the early portion of 2013 is for overall coatings raw material prices to be flat with yearend 2012 but results will vary by commodity given the volatility in supplydemand energy costs and the currency environment it is not feasible to project fullyear 2013 raw material pricing the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs these initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and strategic initiatives with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide and other materials we expect these efforts combined with increases in our selling prices will offset the negative impact of inflation on our coatings businesses in 2013 and recover margin lost from inflation absorbed over the last three years the separation of ppgs commodity chemical business in january 2013 greatly reduced ppgs natural gas exposure with each onedollar change in unit cost per million btus now accounting for about 10 million to 20 million instead of 60 million to 70 million in annual costs and removed ppgs direct exposure with respect to the volatility of ethylene prices despite the reduced annual requirement we will continue to use a variety of techniques to manage our natural gas costs which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging 

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

cash from operating activities was 1787 million  1436 million and 1310 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively cash from operations in 2012 compared to 2011 was aided by cash received from a decrease in working capital of 113 million  higher earnings increased cash from 

26 2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 

operations in 2011 compared to 2010 but the increase was reduced by cash used to fund an increase in working capital of 212 million driven by our sales growth in 2011 

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 trade receivablesnet of the allowance for doubtful accounts plus 2 inventories on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis less 3 trade creditors’ liabilities see note 3 “working capital detail” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses operating working capital at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 29 billion  and 27 billion respectively a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales fourth quarter sales annualized 



operating working capital at december 31 2012 increased 139 million compared with the prior year end level however excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions the change was a decrease of 21 million  during the year ended december 31 2012 this decrease was the net result of decreases in all components of operating working capital trade receivables from customers net as a percentage of fourth quarter sales annualized for 2012 was 176  down slightly from 179 for 2011 days sales outstanding was 61 days in 2012 a one day improvement from 2011 inventories on a fifo basis as a percentage of fourth quarter sales annualized for 2012 was 132  up slightly from 131 in 2011 inventory turnover was 48 times in 2012 and 50 times in 2011 

total capital spending including acquisitions was 533 million  446 million and 341 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was 411 million  390 million and 307 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and is expected to be in the range of 350450 million during 2013 capital spending excluding acquisitions as a percentage of sales was 27  26 and 23 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to 122 million  56 million and 34 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively a primary focus for the corporation in 2013 will continue to be prudent cash deployment focused on profitable earnings growth including pursuing opportunities for additional strategic acquisitions 

in january 2013 ppg received 900 million in cash proceeds in connection with the closing of the separation of its 

 

commodity chemicals business and subsequent merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of georgia gulf refer to note 25 “separation and merger transaction” for financial information regarding the separation of the commodity chemicals business 

in december 2012 the company reached a definitive agreement to acquire the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel nv amsterdam in a deal valued at 105 billion the transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first half of 2013 subject to regulatory approvals 

in december 2012 the company acquired spraylat corp a privatelyowned industrial coatings company based in pelham ny in january 2012 the company completed the previously announced acquisitions of colpisa a colombian producer of automotive oem and refinish coatings and dyrup a european architectural coatings company the total cost of 2012 acquisitions including assumed debt was 288 million  

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 358 million  355 million and 360 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899 and 2012 marked the 41st consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders 

we did not have a mandatory contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2012 and we did not make a voluntary contribution to these plans in 2011 and 2010 we made voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans of 50 million and 250 million respectively we do not expect to make a contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2013 contributions were made to our nonus defined benefit pension plans of 81 million  71 million and 87 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively some of which were required by local funding requirements we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in 2013 in the range of approximately 75 million to 100 million 

the company’s share repurchase activity in 2012 2011 and 2010 was 1 million shares at a cost of 92 million 102 million shares at a cost of 858 million and 81 million shares at a cost of 586 million respectively no ppg stock was purchased in the last nine months of 2012 during the completion of the separation of its commodity chemicals business and subsequent merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of georgia gulf the company reinitiated our share repurchase activity in the first quarter of 2013 we anticipate spending between 500 million and 750 million for share repurchases during 2013 we can repurchase nearly 8 million shares under the current authorization from the board of directors 

in september 2012 ppg entered into a fiveyear credit agreement the credit agreement with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in note 8 debt and bank credit agreements and leases the credit agreement provides for a 12 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in connection with entering into this credit agreement the 

2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 27 

company terminated its 12 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in august 2013 there was no outstanding amount due under the revolving facility at the time of its termination the company has the ability to increase the size of the credit agreement by up to an additional 300 million subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on september 12 2017 

on july 31 2012 ppg completed a public offering of 400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 270 notes due 2022 the 2022 notes” the 2022 notes were offered by the company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement the proceeds of this offering of 397 million net of discount and issuance costs are expected to be used to repay a portion of the 600 million of 575 notes due in march 2013 the 2013 notes” the discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 notes which totaled 3 million will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 notes 

in april 2012 the company reclassified the 600 million of the 2013 notes to shortterm debt and current portion of longterm debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as these notes are due to be repaid in march 2013 also during the yearended december 31 2012  the company assumed 120 million of debt in the dyrup acquisition repaid 119 million of that debt and repaid the 71 million of 6875 notes upon their maturity 

in june 2011 the company repaid a 400 million three year unsecured term loan which had a scheduled maturity date of june 2012 there was no prepayment penalty this 400 million three year unsecured loan was entered into in june 2009 with a variable interest rate based on a spread over the libor this term loan was repaid using a portion of the proceeds from the 1 billion debt we issued in november 2010 

on november 12 2010 ppg completed a public offering of 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 1900 notes due 2016 500 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3600 notes due 2020 and 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5500 notes due 2040 these notes were offered by the company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement the proceeds of this offering were 983 million net of discount and issuance costs we used the proceeds to repay 400 million in term debt and to contribute to employee pension plans and we intend to use the remainder of the proceeds to fund certain asbestos claims and for other general corporate purposes of the company 

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 50  at december 31 2012 down from 53 in 2011 

the company has 3476 million and 2920 million of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively these amounts relate to approximately 300 subsidiaries in more than 70 taxable jurisdictions no deferred us income taxes have been provided on these earnings as they are considered to be 

 

reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so we estimate that of these amounts  2865 million  as of december 31 2012 and  2454 million  as of december 31 2011 of the companys undistributed earnings could be repatriated at little to no us tax cost due in part to the benefit of us foreign tax credits that would be available if these earnings were repatriated the repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries of approximately  611 million  as of december 31 2012 and  466 million  as of december 31 2011 would have resulted in a us tax cost of approximately  110 million  and  85 million  respectively 

we continue to believe that our cash and short term investments on hand cash from operations and the company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending including acquisitions dividend payments debt service amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table

see note 8 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which it may issue offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution 

 

of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 13 “income taxes” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 14 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption at december 31 2012 and for 2013 is 405 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a change in the discount rate of 75 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would impact 2012 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 19 million and 9 million respectively 

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2012 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 75 this assumption will be lowered to 725 for 2013 a change in the rate of return of 75 basis points with other assumptions held constant would impact 2013 net periodic pension expense by approximately 24 million 

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of december 31 2012 

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters the results of these efforts provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill 

2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 29 

and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

currency 

the us dollar weakened from yearend december 31 2011 to yearend december 31 2012 against certain currencies of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling polish zloty and the south korean won a 141 million    increase  in ppg consolidated net assets and shareholders equity resulted from translating ppg’s foreign denominated net assets to us dollars at december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 comparing exchange rates during 2012 to those of 2011 in the countries in which ppg operates the us dollar was generally stronger particularly against the euro which had an unfavorable impact on full year 2012 pretax earnings of approximately 40 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 the us dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the brazilian real and the polish zloty a 188 million   decrease  in ppg consolidated net assets and shareholders equity resulted from translating ppg’s foreign denominated net assets to us dollars at december 31 2011 compared to december 31 2010 however during much of 2011 the us dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which ppg operates than it was in 2010 which had a favorable impact on 2011 pretax earnings of approximately 40 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 the us dollar strengthened against the euro the polish zloty and the british pound sterling while at the same time it weakened against the canadian and australian dollar the chinese yuan the south korean won and the brazilian real which had a nearly offsetting effect on the translation of the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar a 13 million decrease resulted from translating ppg’s foreign denominated net assets at december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 the impact of translating foreign pretax earnings into us dollars was insignificant 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance

or otherwise except as otherwise required by applicable law you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective and the effect of the disposition of the companys commodity chemical business however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

this annual report also contains statements about ppg’s agreement to purchase the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel nv the “transaction” many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements with respect to the transaction including the parties’ ability to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the transaction the parties’ ability to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and schedule risks relating to the ability of the parties to obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction any unforeseen liabilities future capital expenditures revenues expenses earnings synergies economic performance indebtedness financial condition losses and future prospects business and management strategies for the management expansion and growth of ppg’s coatings operations ppg’s ability to integrate the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel nv after the closing and to achieve anticipated synergies and the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm ppg’s business 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices 

30 2012 ppg annual report and form 10k 

and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 11 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2012 and 2011 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of december 31 2012 and 2011 were assets of 3 million and liabilities of 1 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 would have been 14 million and 23 million respectively 

as of january 1 2012 ppg had nine us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 116 billion of which 600 million were to settle on march 15 2013 and 560 million were to settle on march 15 2018 in june 2012 600 million of the swaps with a settlement date of march 15 2013 were settled with ppg receiving 1 million in cash on settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts ppg will receive 560 million us dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts during the term of these contracts ppg will receive semiannual payments in march and september of each year based on us dollar longterm fixed interest rates and ppg will make annual payments in march of each year to the counterparties based on euro longterm fixed interest rates the company designated all of the cross currency swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired sigmakalon businesses and as a result the mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps outstanding have been and will be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income aoci and the cash flow impact of these swaps has been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 95 million and 120 million respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by 84 million and 153 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 449 million as of december 31 2012 and 441 million as of december 31 2011 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 51 million and 50 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

 

the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs at december 31 2011 the notional value of interest rate swaps converted 445 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt during 2012 ppg settled these swaps receiving 29 million from such settlements the fair value of these swaps was an asset of 26 million as of december 31 2011 the fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by 1 million as of december 31 2011 if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately 01 million and 1 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 81 million and 90 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

the company entered into forward starting swaps in 2009 and in the second quarter of 2010 to effectively lockin a fixed interest rate for future debt refinancings with an anticipated term of ten years based on the ten year swap rate to which was added a corporate spread the notional amount of these swaps was 400 million all of the swap contracts were settled on july 30 2012 resulting in a cash payment of 121 million as of december 31 2011 the fair value of these swaps was a liability of 92 million a 10 decline in interest rates would have unfavorably affected the fair value of these swaps by 9 million as of december 31 2011 

the company used derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuating natural gas prices through the use of natural gas swap contracts there were no natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of december 31 2012 as the price of natural gas declined for the past four years and is not expected to be as volatile over the next 12 to 18 months as continued development of shale oil and gas reserves is expected to maintain downward pressure on the price of natural gas as of december 31 2011 the fair value of the contracts was a liability of 9 million a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts by increasing the liability by 2 million at december 31 2011 

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 11 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of december 31 2012 and 2011 was an asset of 130 million and 56 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of 19 million and 12 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively

 raw materials and energy 

  

  

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success the company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins titanium dioxide and other pigments and solvents in the coatings businesses lenses sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials segment brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals segment and sand clay and soda ash in the glass segment many raw material prices began to inflate during 2010 which continued through the majority of 2011 reflecting recovering economic demand and decreased supply stemming from capacity idled or closed during the recession also adverse effects of supplier disruptions due to natural disasters placed additional pressure on some of our supply chains leading to higher prices 

  

coatings raw materials include both organic primarily petroleum based and inorganic materials and generally comprise 70to80 percent of cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component in 2011 overall coatings raw materials costs inflated by approximately 10to12 percent for the company the largest inflation impacts were from titanium dioxide pigments and certain propylenebased resins during 2011 the incremental cost of coatings raw materials due to inflation was approximately 440 million this compares to inflation of approximately 210 million in 2010 and a benefit of 150 million in 2009 reflecting a drop in overall commodity prices due to the recession 

  

energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass segments and our primary energy cost is natural gas ppg purchases 60to70 trillion british thermal units btus of natural gas each year inclusive of the impact of ppg’s natural gas hedging activities ppg’s 2011 natural gas unit cost decreased 15 percent in the us compared to 2010 reflecting higher natural gas supply stemming from the success of shale gas drilling in our commodity chemicals business the positive impact of the lower natural gas prices was partially offset by an increase in ethylene prices during 2011 ppg’s costs for ethylene increased substantially compared to 2010 driven by a combination of tight supply due to production outages and increased global demand particularly in us exports of ethylene derivative products 

  

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs these initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world the company also has undertaken a strategic initiative with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide as well as to add to the global supply of this raw material ppg possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment and we intend to leverage this and engage potential partners to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations joint ventures licensing or other commercial initiatives 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals that impact or could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

  

in december 2006 the european union “eu” member states adopted new comprehensive chemical management legislation known as “reach” registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach applies to all chemical substances manufactured or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more annually and will require the registration of approximately 30000 chemical substances with the european chemicals agency ppg met the requirements for preregistration of such chemicals that ended on december 1 2008 additionally reach requires the registration of these substances entailing the filing of extensive data on their potential risks to human health and the environment registration activities are occurring in three phases over an 11year period based on tonnage and level of concern the first registration deadline was december 1 2010 subsequent phases end in 2013 and 2018 in the case of chemicals with a high level of concern the regulation calls for progressive substitution unless no alternative can be found in these cases authorization of the chemicals will be required 

  

ppg established a dedicated organization to manage reach implementation we have continued to review our product portfolio worked closely with our suppliers to assure their commitment to register substances in our key raw materials and started registration of substances that ppg manufactures or imports as raw materials we will continue to work with our suppliers to understand the future availability and viability of the raw materials we use in our production processes 

  

compliance with the reach legislation will result in increased costs related to the registration process product testing and reformulation risk characterization and participation in substance information exchange forums “siefs” required to coordinate registration dossier preparation ppg identified 10 substances that required 

  

 registration in 2010 and engaged with other key companies through siefs to develop the required registration dossiers actual costs for substance registration were not significant in 2010 or 2011 due primarily to fewer substances requiring registration than originally anticipated the costs for 2013 and 2018 registrations and potential additional future testing in support of 2010 registrations are currently unclear however our current estimate of the total spend during 20122018 is in the range of 10 million to 25 million we anticipate that some current raw materials and products will be subject to the reach authorization process and believe that we will be able to demonstrate adequate risk management for the use and application of the majority of such substances 

  

changes to chemical control regulations have been proposed or implemented in many countries beyond the eu including china canada the united states and korea because implementation of many of these programs have not been finalized the financial impact can not be estimated at this time we anticipate chemical control regulations will continue to increase globally and we have implemented programs to track and comply with the regulations 

  

research and development 

  

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 445 million 408 million and 403 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these costs totaled approximately 3 of sales in each year of the period from 2009 to 2011 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes additional process and product research and development work is also undertaken at many of the company’s manufacturing plants as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china we have obtained government funding of a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

the company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth we align our product development with the macro trends in the enduse markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management 

  

patents 

  

ppg considers patent protection to be important the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg earned 55 million in 2011  58 million in 2010 and 45 million in 2009 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

  

backlog 

  

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

  

nonus operations 

  

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

our sales generated by products sold in the developed and emerging regions of the world over the past three years are summarized below 

 

   

seasonality 

ppg’s earnings are typically greater in the second and third quarters and cash flow from operations is greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in north america and europe this higher activity level results in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash flow 

  

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg at december 31 2011 was 38400 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

  

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment capital 

  

 expenditures for environmental control projects were 15 million 16 million and 27 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2012 will be in the range of 15 – 20 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

  

in march of 2011 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” proposed amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for mercury emissions from mercury cell chloralkali plants known as mercury maximum achievable control technology “mercury mact” the usepa is projecting that it will finalize this rule in september 2012 ppg currently operates one remaining 200 tonperday mercury cell production unit at its natrium wva facility this unit constitutes approximately 4 of ppg’s total chloralkali production capacity ppg has made an application to the ohio river valley water sanitation commission “orsanco” for a variance from the mixing zone prohibition in section vi g of the pollution control standards which are to become effective in october 2013 ppg has requested continued use of a mixing zone for mercury through the life of the current permit which is valid through january 2014 and for any subsequent permit there are ongoing discussions with orsanco and ppg expects a decision by the full commission in 2012 alternative strategies are under consideration to enable the natrium wva facility to operate the mercury production unit in compliance with the new standards if this request for a variance is denied 

  

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 103 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 20 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of december 31 2011 and 2010 ppg had reserves for estimated environmental remediation costs totaling 226 million and 272 million respectively of which 59 million and 83 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2011 2010 and 2009 totaled 16 million 21 million and 11 million respectively cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 59 million 34 million and 24 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the impact of foreign currency translation decreased the liability by 3 million in 2011 and decreased the liability by 2 million in 2010 environmental remediation of a former chromium manufacturing plant site and associated sites in jersey city nj which we refer to as “new jersey chrome” represents the major part of our existing reserves included in the amounts mentioned above were 129 million and 168 million in reserves at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively associated with all new jersey chromium sites 

  

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

  

the company’s continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with new jersey chrome and the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites these charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding 2006 pretax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between 10 million and 35 million per year for the past 15 years changes in 2012 may again be above this historical range as information is being generated from the continuing remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome that will be incorporated into a final remedial action work plan to be submitted in mid2012 which may result in an increase the existing reserve in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence this range of reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites however about 50 percent of this range relates to additional costs at new jersey chrome about 25 percent relates to the calcasieu river estuary and three operating ppg plant sites in the company’s chemicals businesses and the remaining 25 percent relates to a number of other sites including legacy glass manufacturing sites the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them 

  

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned 

  

 relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs 

  

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible these concerns were reflected in the 2005 framework for ghg reduction under the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfccc” the kyoto protocol was adopted by many countries where ppg operates including the european union and canada though not by the us the european union implemented a cap and trade approach with a mandatory emissions trading scheme for ghgs the recent 2011 unfcc climate change conference in durban south africa resulted in the first agreement that includes both developed and developing china and india countries the parties including the us britain china and india agreed to adopt by 2015 a universal legal agreement to cut carbon emissions while ppg has operations in many of these countries a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place 

  

as a result of a us supreme court ruling in april 2007 declaring that ghgs are air pollutants covered by the clean air act usepa proposed and later finalized in december 2009 an endangerment finding that ghg emissions “threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations” based on the endangerment finding the usepa proposed then finalized new “tailored” thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act new source review and title v operating permit programs would be required for new or existing industrial facilities these rules impose new permit requirements on ppg facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year as well as on new equipment installations that will emit more than 75000 tons of ghgs per year the us federal government has committed to a 17 economywide emission reduction target below 2005 levels by 2020 the potential impact on ppg of the implementation of these requirements will not be known until related guidelines are proposed and finalized 

  

with the enactment of usepa’s own ghg reporting verification and permitting regulations ppg made the decision to withdraw from the usbased climate registry reporting program with formal regulations in place ppg no longer saw sufficient value in continuing to belong to this voluntary program also in 2010 usepa announced its decision to disband its own voluntary climate leaders program of which ppg had been a member ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary carbon disclosure project 

  

energy prices and availability of supply continue to be a concern for major energy users since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation in 2007 ppg announced corporate targets namely i a reduction in energy intensity by 25 from 2006 to 2016 and ii a 10 absolute reduction in ghg emissions from 2006 to 2011 effective energy management practices led to a four percent decline in ppg’s ghg emissions while ppg fell short of its goal of reducing ghg emissions by 10 percent the company continues to work toward this longterm goal ppg participates in the us department of energy “doe” save energy now leader program reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity in september 2011 the doe changed its approach to energy efficiency in the industrial sector and initiated the better buildings better plants program ppg is currently participating in this new program which sets energy savings targets and provides a suite of educational training and technical resources to help meet those targets recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area 

  

in march of 2011 the usepa issued clean air act emissions standards for large and small boilers and incinerators that burn solid waste known as the boiler maximum achievable control technology “boiler mact” regulations these regulations are aimed at controlling emissions of air toxics as a result of numerous petitions from both industry and environmental groups usepa was required to reconsider their march 2011 final rule on december 23 2011 the usepa’s proposed rule reconsidering the boiler mact regulations was published in the federal register usepa has indicated its intent to issue the final regulations in early 2012 requiring that covered facilities achieve compliance within three years there are 11 ppg facilities that will likely be subject to these regulations with the 115 megawatt coal fired power plant at ppg’s natrium wva facility being the most significantly impacted ppg continues to evaluate alternative paths of either retrofitting the natrium boilers to burn natural gas or to engineer and install pollution control equipment the estimated potential cost for these capital improvements at our natrium facility could be in the 1520 million range the cost impact for the other affected facilities is not currently known but is expected to be of a lesser magnitude

 item 1a risk factors 

  

as a global manufacturer of coatings chemicals and glass products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business 

  

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy including natural gas energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass segments and our primary energy cost is natural gas each onedollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million british thermal units has a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs inclusive of the impact of ppg’s natural gas hedging activities ppg’s 2011 natural gas unit cost decreased 15 percent in the us compared to 2010 reflecting higher natural gas supply stemming from the success of shale gas drilling also in our commodity chemicals segments ethylene is a key raw material during 2011 ppg’s costs for ethylene increased substantially compared to 2010 driven by a combination of tight supplies due to production outages and increased global demand particularly in us exports of ethylene derivative products 

  

coatings raw materials both organic primarily petroleum based and inorganic generally comprise between 70to80 percent of coatings cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component in 2011 overall coatings raw material costs inflated by approximately 10to12 percent for the company the largest inflation impacts were from titanium dioxide pigments and certain propylenebased resins during 2011 the incremental cost of coatings raw materials due to inflation was approximately 440 million this compares to coatings raw material inflation of approximately 210 million in 2010 and a benefit of 150 million in 2009 from lower coatings raw material prices reflecting a drop in overall commodity prices due to the recession 

  

we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins are at risk of being lowered 

  

most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs these initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and strategic initiatives with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide and other materials 

  

an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner 

  

the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during 2008 worldwide demand for many of our products declined significantly as the impact of the recession spread globally many global industrial enduse markets remained depressed for most of 2009 during 2010 the global economy began to mend however the pace of recovery was uneven beginning in 2011 overall activity levels in most major global economies and in most enduse markets exhibited yearoveryear growth the north american economy experienced early overall improving industrial and chemical activity particularly solid improvement in automotive oem production however as the year progressed factors such as unemployment rates impasses on government policy and concerns over the global economy limited the rate of economic growth in this region the european economy 

  

 underperformed most other major economies economic activity in this region which was growing slowly began to fade and demand in many enduse markets served by ppg turned negative late in the year in many emerging economies such as those in asia and latin america economic activity surpassed the prerecession pace due in part to continued industrial and infrastructure growth in these regions however inflation concerns and government fiscal policies in these regions dampened demand entering 2012 our expectation is for the pace of economic activity to continue to vary by region and by enduse market in north america most major sectors of the economy are expected to strengthen as the recovery continues to gradually move the economy back to prerecession levels the european economy is expected to mildly contract in early 2012 despite growth in exported products but there is downside risk the economic conditions in europe could be even weaker in 2012 the growth rate in emerging regions is expected to continue to moderate and be more erratic but still outpace that of the developed regions based on our broad geographic footprint and extensive enduse market exposure we expect to see overall higher demand in 2012 versus 2011 however the extent of variations in the global economy and their impacts on various enduse markets that we serve is not known ppg provides products and services to a variety of enduse markets and in many geographies while this broad enduse market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any significant or rapid decrease in activity levels nonetheless lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced earnings and cash flows 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental laws and regulations control among other things the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the handling use treatment storage and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and regulate various health and safety matters the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to including those in the united states as well as in other countries in which we operate impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

as described in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our facilities and properties the cost of which is substantial we have accrued a 226 million liability for estimated environmental remediation costs at december 31 2011 our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation if necessary of such environmental contingencies and the potential for technological and regulatory developments as such in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought those lawsuits and claims relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities any such claims whether with or without merit could be time consuming expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources we maintain insurance against some but not all of these potential claims and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses we believe that in the aggregate the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized nonetheless the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

  

for over 30 years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

  

 we are subject to a variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex us and nonus laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws environmental laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices including bribery we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them 

  

new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs for example regulations concerning the composition use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact i the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor ii our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

  

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including political and economic uncertainty inflation rates exchange rates trade protection measures local labor conditions and laws restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings and weak intellectual property protection our percentage of sales generated in 2011 by products sold outside the us was approximately 58 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions however fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies could materially affect our financial results 

  

as a producer of commodity chemicals we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature 

we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner however these materials if mishandled or released into the environment could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us in addition evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs 

  

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages natural disasters and severe weather events computer system disruptions fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers 

  

we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses 

in the past 15 years ppg has completed over 50 acquisitions to further the growth of the company and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future as part of our growth strategy making acquisitions and forming joint ventures involve risks including 

       

      

our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition

the company’s headquarters and companyowned paint stores are located in facilities that are typically leased while the company’s other facilities are generally owned our facilities are considered to be suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are intended and overall have sufficient capacity to conduct business in the upcoming year 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

  

the results of any future litigation and the above lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

for over 30 years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed asbestos settlement arrangement see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

in the past the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

  

ppg received a consolidated compliance order and notice of proposed penalty “conopp” from the 

  

 louisiana department of environmental quality “ldeq” in february 2006 alleging violation of various requirements of its lake charles la facility’s air permit based largely upon permit deviations selfreported by ppg the conopp did not contain a proposed civil penalty ppg filed a request for hearing and has engaged ldeq in settlement discussions since 2006 ppg has held discussions with ldeq to try to resolve the conopp in april 2009 ppg offered to settle all of its selfreported air permit deviations through the first half of 2008 for a proposed penalty of 130000 ldeq responded to this settlement offer by asking ppg to make another offer that includes all selfreported air permit deviations through the end of 2009 ppg has increased its offer to settle this matter to 171000 ldeq has rejected this settlement offer and has asked ppg to consider increasing its offer 

  

ppg received a proposed consent order and final agreement “cofa” from usepa on may 11 2011 which included a proposed penalty of 338000 relating to the alleged exceedance of emission limits for dioxins and furans from the energy recovery unit “eru” at our circleville facility the cofa alleges that ppg failed to meet dioxin and furan limits during a comprehensive performance test on the air pollution control equipment on the eru conducted between august and september of 2009 until the eru was temporarily shut down on september 17 2009 in the cofa usepa also alleged that ppg failed to comply with its startup shutdown and malfunction plan the “ssm plan” during an unspecified period of time in 2009 the eru resumed operations on or about october 14 2009 and ppg believes that it has been operated in compliance with applicable limits since that time it is ppg’s position that the allegations in the cofa are not correct and that ppg did not violate any applicable legal requirements on september 30 2011 ppg and usepa negotiated a settlement in order to resolve this matter which has been memorialized in a revised cofa ppg paid to usepa a civil penalty of 175000 and revised the eru’s ssm plan during the fourth quarter of 2011

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

performance in 2011 compared with 2010 

  

performance overview 

net sales in 2011 totaled 14885 million compared to 13423 million in 2010 an increase of 11 percent higher volumes contributed just over 2 percent and higher selling prices increased sales by 5 percent the remainder of the sales increase was due to the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions the higher sales volumes were achieved in all major geographic regions while four reportable segments had increased volume levels and the other two had level yearoveryear volumes 

  

increased demand was driven by stronger global industrial production activity which aided many of our businesses the global industrial recovery continued in 2011 with solid growth in emerging regions and north america and with modest improvement in europe despite a slight decline in volume in the second half of 2011 due to reduced enduse market demand for fiber glass and automotive refinish based on softness in the region growth rates in asia in 2011 were reduced by the shrinking level of marine originalequipment new ship builds growth was impacted early in the year due to the effects of the japanese earthquake and tsunami and was also tempered late in the year by the negative sales impact stemming from the thailand floods particularly in optical products north american growth was impacted by unscheduled production outages in the commodity chemicals segment earlier in 2011 as well as decreased chlorine industry demand in the fourth quarter activity in construction markets in the developed regions of the world remained at low levels and has not demonstrated any consistent improvement our volume growth for 2011 versus the prior year growth which benefitted from increasing demand as the global industrial economy began to recover from the recession also volumes were flat in the fourth quarter of 2011 as customers curtailed their inventory and were cautious with their order patterns reflecting economic uncertainty the improved selling prices in 2011 were achieved in every reporting segment led by commodity chemicals and each of the three coatings segments the commodity chemicals segment achieved pricing gains due to continued strong demand and tightening supply of caustic soda in our coatings segments prices were raised in response to persistent raw material cost inflation the higher coatings selling prices significantly but did not fully offset the impact of raw material inflation rates that began to flatten in the fourth quarter the favorable currency impact was primarily driven by strengthening european asian and latin american currencies against the us dollar compared to 2010 despite a decline in the value of the euro in the second half of 2011 

  

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by 867 million in 2011 to 9081 million compared to 8214 million in 2010 about fiftyfive percent of the increase was driven by inflation particularly increases in raw material costs primarily in our coatings businesses manufacturing costs were again positive in 2011 additionally about 20 percent of the increase in cost of sales was due to sales growth from volume and acquisitions the effect of foreign currency accounts for about 25 percent of the increase in cost of sales for the year cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 610 percent in 2011 compared to 612 percent in 2010 this improvement reflects a combination of slightly higher margins on the sales volume growth in 2011 due to improved product mix and the benefit of selling price increases particularly in commodity chemicals net of the impact of inflation on cost of sales for the coatings businesses higher pricing significantly offset inflation as raw material costs escalated throughout 2011 however the coatings businesses did not fully offset raw material cost inflation with higher pricing in 2011 and additional pricing actions are underway in 2012 in several businesses to further counter inflation absorbed in 2011 for the company in total inflation was more than offset by higher pricing aided by commodity chemicals 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 255 million to 3234 million in 2011 compared to 2979 million in 2010 the effects of foreign currency inflation and growth in costs to support the increased sales volumes and acquisitions were approximately equal selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were 217 percent in 2011 down from 222 percent in 2010 reflecting the benefit of our continuing effort to aggressively manage our cost growth as our sales volume increases 

  

interest expense increased 21 million to 210 million in 2011 from 189 million in 2010 this increase was driven by the company’s 1 billion debt issuance in november of 2010 partially offset by an early repayment of 400 million in term loans in june 2011 interest income increased 8 million to 42 million in 2011 from 34 million in 2010 due to higher average short term investment balances in 2011 compared to 2010 

  

other charges decreased 11 million to 73 million in 2011 from 84 million in 2010 due principally to the absence of a 6 million antitrust litigation settlement charge which occurred in 2010 and lower environmental remediation expense in 2011 of 5 million 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2011 was approximately 24 percent compared to approximately 32 percent in 2010 the 2011 rate includes a benefit of 12 million resulting from a favorable tax audit settlement the 2011 rate also includes the impact of the nontaxable bargain purchase gain resulting from the equachlor acquisition the effective rate was 25 percent on the remaining pretax earnings in 2011 

  

 the 2010 tax rate includes expense of 85 million resulting from the reduction of our previously provided deferred tax asset related to our liability for retiree medical costs the deferred tax asset needed to be reduced because the healthcare legislation enacted in march 2010 included a provision that reduced the amount of retiree medical costs that will be deductible after december 31 2012 the 2010 rate also included a 5 million benefit as a result of enacted changes in statutory tax rates outside the us the effective rate was 26 percent on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010 the decrease in the tax rate on the remaining pretax earnings in 2011 is mainly the result of tax planning initiatives in the fourth quarter the benefit of which are expected to continue in 2012 

  

net income attributable to ppg and earnings per share – assuming dilution attributable to ppg for 2011 and 2010 are summarized below 

 

   

average shares used to calculate earnings per share – assuming dilution were 1573 million in 2011 and 1645 million in 2010 the reduction is the result of share buyback activity in 2011 

  

results of reportable business segments 

 

   

performance coatings sales increased 345 million or 8 percent to 4626 million in 2011 the sales increase was comprised of 5 percent due to price and 3 percent due to currency volumes for the segment were slightly favorable as volume increases in automotive refinish and aerospace were offset by lowsingle digit percentage volume declines in the protective and marine coatings and the architecturalamericas and asia pacific coatings businesses aerospace volumes continued to grow reflecting robust industry demand and ppg share gains automotive refinish volume increased but growth was impacted by customer inventory management at yearend and weaker european activity levels in the second half of the year marine coatings volumes were down reflecting the decline in ship build activity and reduced global shipping during the last quarter of 2011 improved protective coatings volumes in most regions reflecting higher energy and infrastructure demand partly offset the sales decline in marine us architectural coatings volumes were relatively flat this included the severely negative volume trends in the us early in 2011 due to weather conditions architectural volumes in the emerging regions declined low single digit percentages including the negative impacts from lower demand near the end of 2011 segment income in 2011 increased 12 million to 673 million the impacts of improved volumes in automotive refinish and aerospace manufacturing cost reductions and favorable currency impacts more than offset the negative impact of inflation net of price to result in the earnings improvement in 2011 compared to 2010 pricing improved in all businesses reflecting our continuing efforts to address persistent input cost inflation 

  

looking ahead to the first quarter 2012 lower marine activity levels are expected to continue strong aerospace demand is also expected to carryforward us architectural volumes are anticipated to be flattomodestly improved while emerging region architectural coatings markets are expected to remain challenging in addition we intend to implement higher us architectural pricing based on previously announced price increases also we anticipate less customer inventory management impacts in the segment currency impacts for the segment are expected to be negative based on current exchange rates in comparison with the first quarter 2011 exchange rates 

  

industrial coatings sales increased 450 million or 12 percent compared to 2010 to 4158 million the sales increase was comprised of 5 percent due to volume 4 percent due to price and 3 percent due to currency segment income improved 16 percent versus 2010 to 438 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased volumes lower manufacturing costs and currency partially offset by the negative impact of inflation net of increases in selling prices and growthdriven increases in overhead costs segment volume grew by 5 percent on solid global industrial demand with positive results in all three business units growth rates were robust in asia as a result of continued growth in the region for all three businesses the automotive oem business delivered strong singledigit percentage growth reflecting high growth rates due to the automotive industry recovery with continued growth in north america asia pacific and latin america and low growth in europe where volumes were positive for the full year but weakened in the second half of the year global volumes in the industrial and packaging businesses were also favorable with asia pacific the strongest region delivering the majority of the growth with somewhat lower or even declining volumes in europe and north america due in part to late year customer destocking 

  

 looking ahead we anticipate continued volume growth including higher global auto production and strong general industrial activity we also anticipate further price increases to restore margin lost to raw material inflation in 2011 currency is expected to be negative to sales and earnings in the first quarter 

  

architectural coatings  emea sales increased 230 million or 12 percent to 2104 million in 2011 the sales increase was comprised of 5 percent due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation a 1 percent increase from acquired business and the remainder from an increase in selling prices and volume gains segment earnings were up 10 million compared to the prior year positive yearoveryear earnings resulted from the earnings impact of volume growth and currency translation earnings in 2011 were reduced by a 9 million charge related to a ukbased retail doityourself customer who filed for bankruptcy during the second quarter of 2011 and the adverse impact of inflation net of price increases 

  

looking ahead we anticipate soft demand to continue in europe as we begin 2012 first quarter 2012 results will also include the results of the dyrup acquisition which closed in january 2012 we anticipate negative currency translation impacts given the segment’s large euro base of sales and earnings and the decline in the value of the euro compared with the first quarter of 2011 

  

optical and specialty materials sales for 2011 increased 63 million or 6 percent compared to 2010 to 1204 million due to a 2 percent increase in volumes pricing and the favorable impact of currency earnings grew by 6 percent to 326 million both optical products and silicas achieved sales growth coming from higher volumes pricing and the impact of currency the silicas business’ volumes benefitted from the higher automotive oem production resulting in increased demand for our products sold into the tire and battery markets segment results were tempered by the negative impact from the serious flooding in thailand that disrupted optical customers and supply chains the flooding also impacted production of ppg’s optical materials resulting in a declaration of force majeure during the fourth quarter segment earnings increased due to the factors increasing sales which exceeded the impact of inflation higher manufacturing costs and volume driven growth in overhead cost 

  

looking ahead we do not anticipate any notable 2012 residual impact from the thailand flooding as we approached normal operations at the end of december we expect a normal seasonal uptick for optical in the first quarter and transitions ® growth to resume driven by market growth and share gain versus clear lenses in emerging regions in addition we are commercializing vantage ® our new transitions ® cleartopolarized product in the first half of 2012 and we expect increased marketing costs associated with the launch of this new product we also anticipate recent silica market trends to continue aided by higher auto production and the tire industry focus on improving fuel efficiency through higher silica content in tires similar to other global ppg businesses currency is expected to have a negative yearoveryear impact in the first quarter 

  

commodity chemicals sales in 2011 versus the prior year increased 298 million or 21 percent to 1732 million higher pricing and the impact of the equachlor acquisition were the key factors producing the improved sales and earnings segment earnings increased 181 million to 370 million in 2011 capacity utilization was lower in the second third and fourth quarters due to planned and unplanned production outages as well as lower chlorine industry demand in the fourth quarter due to customer inventory management and lower chlorine derivative exports resulting in higher manufacturing and maintenance expenses natural gas unit costs were lower yearoveryear but ethylene costs were higher an increase in overhead costs was substantially offset by gains from asset sales primarily related to the lease of marcellus shale natural gas drilling rights on ppg owned property and lower environmental expense 

  

looking forward we anticipate higher chlorine demand in the first quarter of 2012 sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2011 due to both seasonal factors and modest customer inventory restocking this would result in improved capacity utilization compared to the fourth quarter but still lower versus an exceptionally strong operating rate in the first quarter 2011 caustic inventory is extremely low and we intend to implement announced caustic price increases in the first quarter also the current natural gas market price has declined below 300 per unit 

  

glass sales increased 76 million or 8 percent compared to 2010 to 1061 million in 2011 sales increased 4 percent due to pricing 2 percent due to volume growth with the remainder attributable to favorable foreign currency impacts solid fiber glass pricing gains drove the sales growth together with improved flat glass volumes fiber glass volumes were also up over 2010 but were lower in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to lower european demand segment earnings grew to 97 million compared to 74 million a year ago higher sales prices and volumes were the primary drivers of the earnings improvement the earnings results were tempered somewhat by raw material cost inflation higher fiber glass maintenance costs and higher overhead costs 

  

 looking forward we anticipate fiber glass volume trends to be sequentially comparable with the second half of 2011 which was down versus the first half which may adversely impact pricing flat glass activity is also expected to be comparable with the second half of 2011 we also expect the electronics market to remain weak especially against strong first quarter 2011 comparables adversely impacting our fiber glass equity earnings cost control is a perennial focus for this segment 

  

outlook 

  

at the beginning of 2011 overall activity levels in most major global economies and for most enduse markets were experiencing yearoveryear growth although levels in the developed regions were still below the prerecession rates of 2008 in many emerging regions economic activity surpassed the prerecession pace due in part to continued solid industrial and infrastructure growth in those regions one notable exception to the 2011 recovery was the construction markets in the developed regions which remained static at extremely low activity levels in comparison with the past decade during the middle of 2011 growth rates slowed in most economic sectors and regions as concerns emerged over government debt levels fiscal policy and associated austerity measures late in the year the pace of all major economies slowed reflecting heightened concerns over the potential financial crisis stemming from government indebtedness and related actions particularly in the euro zone 

  

the north american economy generally followed the global trends with improving overall industrial and chemical activity aided by lower regional energy costs due to increased availability of natural gas stemming from the success of shale gas drilling this lower feedstock cost resulted in higher export activity due to the favorable regional energy cost input advantages also aiding the industrial recovery was continued solid improvement in automotive oem production although production levels grew throughout the year they were still considerably lower than prerecession levels similar to 2010 construction markets showed initial signs of a potential recovery early in the year but optimism faded and activity levels were flat until very modest improvements were evidenced late in the year unemployment rates impasses on government policy and concerns over the global economy served as additional factors which limited the rate of economic growth in the region despite these limitations the region ended the year with more growth promise than many other major developed regional economies 

  

at the outset of 2011 growth in the european economy continued to underperform most other major economies as concerns heightened over government budget deficits and their ability to sustain or refinance government debt loads anxiety rose throughout the year as global financial markets grew more concerned with european sovereign debt loads government action was subdued due in part to disagreement within the european union over a course of action and also due to the already high level of government economic support within the region economic activity which began the year slowly faded and demand in many enduse markets served by ppg turned negative late in the year the region ended the year weaker and with no clear catalyst to initiate a recovery 

  

many of the major emerging economies such as those in asia pacific and latin america were expanding entering 2011 aided by continued growth in exports expansion of their domestic markets and improved energy or rare earth mineral availability inflation concerns in these emerging regions served to either dampen demand or caused governments to take action with the same objective growth rates however remained above those in developed regions with a slowly shifting emphasis toward internal consumption partly offsetting slower or no growth in exports from the regions 

  

entering 2012 the expectation is for the pace of economic activity to continue to vary by region in north america most major sectors of the economy are expected to strengthen as the recovery continues to gradually move the economy back toward prerecession levels this increased activity level is expected to be led by higher industrial and chemical production while improvement in construction is likely to be modest and inconsistent the 2012 growth rate in emerging regions is expected to continue to moderate and be more erratic but still outpace that of the developed regions the european economy is expected to mildly contract in early 2012 despite some growth in exports but there is downside risk the economic conditions in europe could be even weaker in 2012 

  

since the middle of 2010 commodity and oil prices have experienced inflation due to tight supply stemming from manufacturing capacity remaining idled or removed from service during the recession and improving demand for commodities it is anticipated that prices will remain at elevated levels during the first half of 2012 ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials used in many of our businesses factors which impact our input prices are supplydemand imbalances global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs over the past two years combined ppg’s coatings raw material costs have inflated by about 650 million our current forecast for the early portion of 2012 is for overall coatings raw material prices to be flat with yearend 2011 levels but up in comparison to fullyear 2011 reflecting the fact that costs rose during 2011 given the volatility in supplydemand energy cost and the currency environment it is not feasible to project fullyear 2012 raw material pricing 

  

 changes in natural gas pricing have a significant impact on the financial performance of our commodity chemicals and glass segments each onedollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million british thermal units has a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs our 2011 natural gas costs averaged approximately 465 per mmbtu for the year while our 2010 costs averaged about 550 per unit we currently estimate the market cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2012 will be between 250 and 300 per mmbtu we currently have about 10 percent of fullyear 2012 us natural gas needs hedged at an average price of about 450 per unit from hedges placed prior to 2012 while it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we will continue to use a variety of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging 

  

in an effort to offset the adverse impact of raw material cost inflation on earnings during 2011 ppg initiated higher selling prices in all operating segments the company has historically raised selling prices to counteract the negative earnings impact from inflation higher pricing in 2011 did not fully counter inflation in our coatings segments for the full year but the offset grew higher each quarter of the year we intend to implement additional pricing for 2012 to further offset the inflation absorbed in 2011 commodity chemicals pricing improved during the year but fell modestly in the fourth quarter due to lower chlorine demand 

  

our pension and postretirement benefit costs were about 230 million in 2011 a decrease of approximately 30 million from 2010 which included the benefit of a plan change in january 2011 these costs are expected to increase in 2012 by about 35 million to 45 million primarily due to the reduction in the discount rate consistent with the decline of interest rates during 2011 ppg’s cash contributions to our pension plans totaled 121 million following cash contributions of 340 and 330 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively and we anticipate 2012 contributions will be in the range of 130 million to 150 million 

  

we expect our ongoing tax rate in 2012 to be in the range of 25 percent to 26 percent consistent with the 2011 rate the reduction we have achieved in 2011 in our ongoing tax rate reflects the impact from tax planning strategies and our sales and earnings growth outside the us where corporate income tax rates are lower particularly in asia pacific and europe a similar benefit from these tax planning strategies is expected to impact the 2012 effective tax rate because of the differences in regional tax rates a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings will impact our ongoing tax rate 

  

the company’s cash generation has been consistent and at or near record levels over the past four years despite the recession and a significant increase in the level of voluntary pension contributions over the past two years the company has repurchased over 179 million shares of stock at a cost of 14 billion and the company ended the year with approximately 9 million shares left under the current authorization from the board of directors the company entered 2012 with about 15 billion in cash and shortterm investments which remains at a historically high level for the company we completed the previously announced acquisitions of dyrup and colpisa in january 2012 to strengthen our coatings businesses by broadening their product offerings and extending their operations into new geographic areas the sales of these businesses in 2011 were approximately 300 million we anticipate making additional acquisitions in 2012 as part of our strategy for accelerating growth we will remain disciplined and deploy our cash in ways that will support future earnings growth and we are targeting to end 2012 with less than 1 billion in cash and shortterm investments 

  

our current economic outlook for 2012 is for global growth to continue but we expect it to be uneven by region growth in asia pacific will be higher than the other regions of the world in contrast we expect to see economic contraction in europe in the first half of 2012 and the level of uncertainty concerning the credit crisis in that region increases the risk that the economy there will weaken further considering the expected ongoing global growth coupled with our broad geographic footprint and extensive enduse market exposure we expect to see overall higher demand in 2012 versus 2011 ppg intends to remain proactive in managing our businesses to address these varied market conditions and level of economic uncertainty ppg has in the past initiated cost reduction actions in response to lower endmarket demand and downward pressure on our margins these actions have included strict management of discretionary costs and in some cases restructuring actions focused on lowering our fixed cost structure

 performance in 2010 compared with 2009 

  

performance overview 

net sales in 2010 totaled 13423 million compared to 12239 million in 2009 an increase of 10 percent higher volumes contributed 8 percent and higher selling prices increased sales by 1 percent the remainder of the sales increase was due to foreign currency and acquisitions the higher sales volumes were achieved in all major geographic regions and in all reportable segments with the exception of architectural coatings – emea reflecting the partial recovery in demand from the impact of the global recession our overall volume growth was driven by automotive oem coatings growth of almost 30 percent while continuing weakness in construction and maintenance markets reduced architectural coatings volumes in europe as demand declines remained at about 5 percent throughout the year growth in north america was driven by improving industrial activity especially in new automotive builds aerospace transportation and consumer products sales in europe did increase slightly for the year although the rate of recovery in the european economy underperformed in comparison with most other major economies this was driven by recurring concerns over governmental spending and the ability to sustain or refinance government debt loads which caused many major european countries to initiate significant austerity measures the major emerging economies in which we operate such as asia and latin america maintained late 2009 economic momentum and grew throughout 2010 in many cases surpassing prerecession economic activity levels industrial growth rates remained high including midteen percentage growth in china the company’s record sales in emerging regions reflects the measurable benefits from ppg’s strategic initiatives to broaden enduse markets served and improve our penetration in the rapid growth regions 

  

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by 675 million in 2010 to 8214 million compared to 7539 million in 2009 about 80 percent of the increase was due to volume growth additionally about 40 percent of the increase was driven by inflation offset by a decrease of nearly 25 percent in manufacturing costs which was a result of the restructuring and cost savings initiatives taken by the company cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 612 percent in 2010 compared to 616 percent in 2009 the impact of inflation on cost of sales in 2010 was offset by increases in selling prices and lower manufacturing costs the incremental sales volume in 2010 delivered an above average gross margin these factors combined to produce the reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of sales 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 43 million to 2979 million in 2010 compared to 2936 million in 2009 nearly half of the increase was due to the effects of inflation more than 35 percent due to increased sales volumes and approximately 15 percent due to the effects of foreign currency the increase was offset partially by specific overhead cost reduction actions selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were 222 percent in 2010 down from 240 percent in 2009 as incremental volume growth was achieved without significant increases in selling costs 

  

during the first quarter of 2009 the company finalized a restructuring plan that was focused on further reducing ppg’s global cost structure the company recorded a charge of 186 million for the cost of these restructuring actions 

  

other charges increased 19 million to 84 million in 2010 from 65 million in 2009 due principally to 10 million higher environmental remediation expense compared to 2009 and a 6 million antitrust litigation settlement charge other earnings increased 30 million to 180 million in 2010 from 150 million in 2009 due primarily to higher equity earnings and royalties offset partially by the absence of gains on nonoperating asset sales that occurred in 2009 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2010 was 320 percent compared to 310 percent in 2009 the 2010 rate includes expense of 85 million resulting from the reduction of our previously provided deferred tax asset related to our liability for retiree medical costs the deferred tax asset needed to be reduced because the us healthcare legislation enacted in march 2010 included a provision that reduced the amount of retiree medical costs that will be deductible after december 31 2012 the 2010 rate also included a 5 million benefit as a result of enacted changes in statutory tax rates outside the us the rate was approximately 26 percent on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010 

  

the 2009 rate includes a tax benefit of 2 million related to audit settlements and a tax benefit of 245 percent related to the business restructuring charge the rate was approximately 30 percent on the remaining pretax earnings in 2009 

  

the decrease in the tax rate on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010 is mainly the result of shifts in the geographic mix of pretax earnings to lower taxed regions of the world 

  

 net income attributable to ppg and earnings per share – assuming dilution attributable to ppg for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below 

 

  

   

results of reportable business segments 

 

   

performance coatings sales increased 186 million or 5 percent to 4281 million in 2010 the sales increase was comprised of 3 percent due to price and 2 percent due to currency volumes for the segment were slightly positive as volume increases in automotive refinish aerospace and protective and marine coatings were offset by a midsingle digit percentage volume decline in the architecturalamericas and asia pacific coatings business the growth in the automotive refinish business was a result of market share gains and recovery from the customer destocking in 2009 aerospace and protective and marine coatings also achieved solid volume growth due to strong growth in both emerging and developed regions these businesses both have a sizeable aftermarket component serve lateeconomic cycle industries and did not experience the same degree of volume decline during the recession as most of our other businesses segment income in 2010 increased 110 million to 661 million the increase in earnings resulted from the impact of higher sales volume improved sales margin mix lower overhead costs and favorable currency the negative earnings impact of inflation was offset by favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs the increase in income was led by automotive refinish protective and marine coatings and aerospace businesses as all benefited from partial volume recovery and lower costs as a result of our cost savings initiatives 

  

industrial coatings sales increased 640 million or 21 percent compared to 2009 to 3708 million the sales increase was comprised of 19 percent due to volume 1 percent due to price and 1 percent due to currency translation volume growth was led by the automotive oem and industrial businesses’ emerging regions both reflecting the continuing gradual recovery from the global recession segment income improved 138 percent versus 2009 to 378 million in 2010 this increase was primarily due to increased volumes and lower manufacturing and overhead costs partially offset by the negative impact of inflation net of increases in selling prices earnings returned closer to prerecession levels as this segment was the most impacted segment by the recession 

  

architectural coatings – emea sales decreased 78 million or 4 percent to 1874 million in 2010 the sales decrease was comprised of 4 percent due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 2 percent decline in sales volume which includes the positive impact of some small acquisitions offset by a 2 percent increase in selling prices volume trends remained consistent throughout 2010 declining by midsingledigit percentages reflecting continued general sluggishness in the european construction and maintenance markets there were solid price gains made in response to higher raw materials costs segment income decreased 15 million to 113 million in 2010 the negative earnings impact of lower sales volumes was only partially offset by lower overhead costs and the positive impact of price increases net of inflation 

  

optical and specialty materials sales for 2010 increased 139 million or 14 percent compared to 2009 to 1141 million due almost entirely to increased volumes in both the optical and silicas businesses both the optical products and silicas businesses delivered doubledigit volume growth in each quarter during 2010 as a result segment sales and earnings results for the year were alltime records increased sales penetration was achieved in the enduse market for transitions ® lens products including about 20 percent growth in emerging regions volume recovery momentum continued in silicas in large part due to the recovery in several silicas enduse markets including automotive oem production segment income increased 72 million to 307 million in 2010 primarily due to the improved volumes partially offset by higher selling and advertising costs to support the increased optical volumes 

  

 commodity chemicals sales in 2010 versus the prior year increased 161 million or 13 percent to 1434 million sales improved 15 percent due to higher volumes driven by the economic recovery in 2010 partially offset by a 3 percent decline in pricing for the year the impact of foreign currency translation was slightly positive segment income increased 37 million to 189 million in 2010 due to the impact of the higher volumes as well as favorable manufacturing and overhead costs resulting from our cost savings initiatives factors partially offsetting the earnings improvement were the impact of the lower pricing and input cost inflation 

  

glass sales increased 136 million or 16 percent compared to 2009 to 985 million in 2010 sales increased 18 percent due to volume growth offset by a 2 percent reduction in pricing the sales volume improvement was largely in the fiber glass business resulting from higher demand as a result of the improved global economy the lower flat glass pricing was a result of the continued sluggishness in the residential and commercial construction markets segment income increased 113 million to 74 million in 2010 due primarily to the impact of the higher fiber glass sales volumes lower manufacturing costs as a result of our restructuring and cost savings initiatives and higher fiber glass equity earnings which reflect the overall improvement in the global demand for electronics partially offset by the impact of the lower flat glass pricing

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement 

  

as discussed in item 3 and note 15 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 15 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

  

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 226 million and 272 million respectively of which 59 million and 83 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2011 2010 and 2009 totaled 16 million 21 million and 11 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 59 million 34 million and 24 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the impact of foreign currency translation decreased the liability by 3 million in 2011 and by 2 million in 2010 

  

in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence about 50 of this reasonably possible loss relates to new jersey chrome 

  

our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with new jersey chrome and at the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites these charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding 2006 pretax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between 10 million and 35 million per year for the past 15 years information is being generated from the continuing remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome that will be incorporated into a final remedial action work plan to be submitted in mid 2012 which may result in an increase to the existing reserve 

  

 management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to range from 50 million to 70 million annually through 2016 it is possible that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays specifically the level of expected cash outlays and charges for environmental remediation costs are highly dependent upon activity related to new jersey chrome as ppg expects to submit additional remedial action work plans to the applicable regulatory agencies in 2012 

  

impact of inflation 

in 2011 ppg experienced a reduction in the price of natural gas its primary energy cost but experienced a significant rise in ethylene a commodity chemical raw material and in coatings raw material prices coatings raw materials both organic primarily petroleum based and inorganic materials generally comprise 70to80 percent of coatings cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg’s single largest production cost component in 2011 overall coatings raw materials costs inflated by approximately 10to12 percent for the company the largest inflation impacts were from titanium dioxide pigments and certain propylenebased resins this impact was not entirely offset by higher selling prices in our performance coatings and architectural coatings – emea reportable segments there was also a coverage gap in our industrial coatings reportable segment even with this segment using product reformulations to attempt to counter this impact our commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments were able to more than fully offset the impact of inflation with price increases while inflation was not significant for our optical and specialty materials reportable segment 

  

in 2010 ppg experienced a reduction in its primary energy costs but a steady increase in its coatings raw material costs most notably in the second half of the year this was driven by higher global demand as a result of the gradual recovery in the global economy and tightness of supply as suppliers have not increased their capacities this impact was offset by higher selling prices in our performance coatings and architectural coatings – emea reportable segments and partially offset in our industrial coatings reportable segment industrial coatings partially addressed the remaining impact of raw material inflation with further cost reductions in 2010 the impact of inflation net of price was positive in the optical and specialty materials reportable segment and negative in the commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments 

  

in 2009 ppg experienced a reduction in our energy and raw material costs following the significant increases in these costs experienced in 2008 and 2007 which was driven by lower global demand as a result of the recession and the delayed impact of lower oil prices this impact was largely offset by reductions in our selling prices the impact of inflation net of price was negative in our commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments and was positive in our three coatings and the optical and specialty materials reportable segments 

  

in 2012 we expect the majority of our raw material costs in all of our coatings reportable segments to stabilize although the price of some raw materials are expected to remain volatile and to result in inflation while others have declined the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs these initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy qualifying multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and strategic initiatives with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance ppg’s supply of titanium dioxide and other materials we expect these efforts combined with increases in our selling prices will offset the negative impact of inflation on our coatings businesses in 2012 and recover margin lost from inflation absorbed in 2011 it is expected however that our selling prices may not be able to cover raw material increases in certain of our segments the company will look to other cost control measures to attempt to manage this negative impact on these reportable segments we will also continue our efforts to manage our energy costs in 2012 

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

  

cash from operating activities was 1436 million 1310 million and 1345 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively higher earnings increased cash from operations in 2011 compared to 2010 but the increase was reduced by cash used to fund an increase in working capital of 212 million driven by our sales growth in 2011 cash provided by working capital was greater in 2009 than 2010 and that decline was more than offset by the cash from higher 2010 earnings 

  

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 trade receivablesnet of the allowance for doubtful accounts plus 2 inventories on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis less 3 trade creditors’ liabilities see note 3 “working capital detail” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses operating working capital at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 27 billion and 26 billion respectively a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales fourth quarter sales annualized 

 

   

the change in operating working capital elements excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions was an increase of 195 million during the year ended december 31 2011 this increase was the net result of an increase in receivables from customers associated with the 2011 increase in sales and an increase in fifo inventory slightly offset by an increase in trade creditors’ liabilities trade receivables from customers net as a percentage of fourth quarter sales annualized for 2011 was 179 percent down slightly from 181 percent for 2010 days sales outstanding was 66 days in 2011 level with 2010 inventories on a fifo basis as a percentage of fourth quarter sales annualized for 2011 was 131 percent level with 2010 inventory turnover was 50 times in 2011 and 46 times in 2010 

  

total capital spending including acquisitions was 446 million 341 million and 265 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was 390 million 307 million and 239 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and is expected to be in the range of 450550 million during 2012 capital spending excluding acquisitions as a percentage of sales was 26 23 and 20 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to 56 million 34 million and 26 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and expect to use cash in 2012 to fund small to midsized acquisitions as part of a balanced deployment of our cash to support growth in earnings in january 2012 the company closed the previously announced acquisitions of colpisa a colombian producer of automotive oem and refinish coatings and dyrup a european architectural coatings company the cost of these acquisitions including assumed debt was 193 million 

  

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 355 million 360 million and 353 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899 and 2011 marked the 40th consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders 

  

we did not have a mandatory contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2011 however we made voluntary contributions to these plans in 2011 totaling 50 million in 2010 and 2009 we made voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans of 250 and 360 million of which 100 million was made in ppg stock respectively we expect to make voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2012 of up to 60 million contributions were made to our nonus defined benefit pension plans of 71 million 87 million and 90 million of which approximately 20 million was made in ppg stock for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively some of which were required by local funding requirements we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in 2012 of approximately 90 million 

  

the company’s share repurchase activity in 2011 2010 and 2009 was 102 million shares at a cost of 858 million 81 million shares at a cost of 586 million and 15 million shares at a cost of 59 million respectively we expect to make share repurchases in 2012 as part of our cash deployment focused on earnings growth the amount of spending will depend on the level of acquisition spending and other uses of cash but we currently expect to spend in the range of 250 million to 500 million on share repurchases in 2012 we can repurchase about 9 million shares under the current authorization from the board of directors 

  

 in june 2011 the company repaid a 400 million three year unsecured term loan which had a scheduled maturity date of june 2012 there was no prepayment penalty this 400 million three year unsecured loan was entered into in june 2009 with a variable interest rate based on a spread over the london interbank offered rate “libor” this term loan was repaid using a portion of the proceeds from the 1 billion debt we issued in november 2010 

  

on november 12 2010 ppg completed a public offering of 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 1900 notes due 2016 500 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3600 notes due 2020 and 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5500 notes due 2040 these notes were offered by the company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement the proceeds of this offering were 983 million net of discount and issuance costs we used the proceeds to repay 400 million in term debt and to contribute to employee pension plans and we intend to use the remainder of the proceeds to fund certain asbestos claims and for other general corporate purposes of the company 

  

in august 2010 ppg entered into a threeyear credit agreement with several banks and financial institutions the “credit agreement” the credit agreement provides for a 12 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in connection with entering into this credit agreement the company terminated its €650 million and its 1 billion revolving credit facilities that were each set to expire in 2011 there were no outstanding amounts due under either revolving facility at the time of their termination the company has the ability to increase the size of the credit agreement by up to an additional 300 million subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on august 5 2013 there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2011 however the available borrowing rate on a one month us dollar denominated borrowing would have been 105 percent 

  

ppg entered into 400 million of forward starting swaps in 2009 and 2010 which are set to expire during 2012 the company plans to issue 10 year debt in connection with the expiration of these instruments and intends to use the proceeds from this issuance in 2013 to repay the 600 million in notes due in 2013 

  

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 53 at december 31 2011 and 2010 

  

no deferred us income taxes have been provided on undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries which amounted to 2920 million as of december 31 2011 and 2465 million as of december 31 2010 these earnings are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings 

  

we continue to believe that our cash on hand cash from operations and the company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending including acquisitions dividend payments debt service amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table 

 

      

the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases natural gas coal and electricity consistent with customary industry practice these amounts also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from our rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 5 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

see note 8 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

  

 in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which it may issue offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

  

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 13 “income taxes” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually see note 14 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

  

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption at december 31 2011 and for 2012 is 450 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a change in the discount rate of 75 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would impact 2012 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 10 million and 8 million respectively 

  

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2011 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 80 percent this assumption will be lowered to 75 percent for 2012 a change in the rate of return of 75 basis points with other assumptions held constant would impact 2012 net periodic pension expense by approximately 22 million 

  

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of december 31 2011 

  

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters the results of these efforts provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

  

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

 currency 

from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 the us dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the brazilian real and the polish zloty a 188 million decrease in ppg consolidated net assets and shareholders equity resulted from translating ppg’s foreign denominated net assets to us dollars at december 31 2011 compared to december 31 2010 however during much of 2011 the us dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which ppg operates than it was in 2010 which had a favorable impact on 2011 pretax earnings of approximately 40 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

  

from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 the us dollar strengthened against the euro the polish zloty and the british pound sterling while at the same time it weakened against the canadian and australian dollar the chinese yuan the south korean won and the brazilian real which had a nearly offsetting effect on the translation of the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar a 13 million decrease resulted from translating ppg’s foreign denominated net assets at december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 the impact of translating foreign pretax earnings into us dollars was insignificant 

  

from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operated most notably against the euro the canadian dollar the british pound sterling the polish zloty the brazilian real the south korean won and the australian dollar as a result the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets at december 31 2009 by 173 million compared to december 31 2008 during much of the year the us dollar was stronger against the currencies of many countries in which ppg operated than it was in 2008 which had an unfavorable impact on 2009 pretax earnings of 29 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

  

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

  

you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as otherwise required by applicable law you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

  

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 11 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

  

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2011 and 2010 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of december 31 2011 and 2010 were liabilities of 1 million and assets of 2 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 percent for european currencies and 20 percent for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 would have been 23 million and 22 million respectively 

  

ppg entered into nine us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 116 billion of which 600 million were to settle on march 15 2013 and 560 million were to settle on march 15 2018 another contract with a notional amount of 140 million and a settlement date of march 15 2018 was converted to cash during the first quarter of 2010 accordingly on settlement of the contracts ppg will receive 116 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts the company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired sigmakalon businesses and as a result mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of 120 million and 163 million respectively a 10 percent increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by 153 million and 158 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 441 million as of december 31 2011 and 447 million as of december 31 2010 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 percent against european currencies and by 20 percent against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 50 million and 52 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the notional value of outstanding interest rate swaps totaled 445 million and 450 million respectively the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of 26 million and 20 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by 1 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 percent a 10 percent increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 percent increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately 1 million as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively further a 10 percent reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately  90 million and 115 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

  

 the company entered into forward starting swaps in 2009 and in the second quarter of 2010 to effectively lockin a fixed interest rate for future debt refinancings with an anticipated term of ten years based on a the ten year swap rate to which will be added a corporate spread the notional amount of these swaps totaled 400 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the fair value of these swaps was a liability of 92 million as of december 31 2011 and 21 million as of december 31 2010 a 10 percent decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by 9 million and 14 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31 2011 and 2010 was a liability of 9 million and 31 million respectively these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to higher prices of natural gas a 10 percent reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts by increasing the liability by 2 million and 5 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 11 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of december 31 2011 and 2010 was an asset of 56 million and 55 million respectively a 10 percent decrease in ppg’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of 12 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success our primary energy cost is natural gas used in our commodity chemicals and glass businesses inclusive of the impact of ppg’s natural gas hedging activities ppg’s 2010 natural gas cost decreased 12 in the us compared to 2009 

  

during 2010 the incremental cost of coatings raw materials due to inflation was approximately 210 million this compares to a benefit from lower coatings raw material prices of 150 million in 2009 and to raw material inflation of 150 million in 2008 many of our coatings raw materials are petroleum based and changes in pricing for these raw materials traditionally lag oil price fluctuations by several months while crude oil prices remained relatively stable through most of the year the tightness of supply of several key raw materials along with unanticipated stronger global demand drove market price increases in nearly all major coatings raw material categories in addition the adverse effects of a significant number of supplier disruptions including force majeure declarations by key suppliers across most of our product portfolio strained our supply chains and encouraged higher prices 

  

the company’s most significant raw materials are titanium dioxide solvents and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses lenses sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business and sand clay and soda ash in the glass businesses energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass businesses most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs these initiatives include reformulation of certain of our products using both petroleumderived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy another initiative is to qualify multiple and local sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals that impact or could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

  

in december 2006 the european union “eu” member states adopted new comprehensive chemical management legislation known as “reach” registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach applies to all chemical substances manufactured or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more annually and will require the registration of approximately 30000 chemical substances with the european chemicals agency ppg met the requirements for preregistration of such chemicals that ended on december 1 2008 additionally reach requires the registration of these substances entailing the filing of extensive data on their potential risks to human health and the environment registration activities are occurring in three phases over an 11year period based on tonnage and level of concern the first registration deadline was december 1 2010 subsequent phases end in 2013 and 2018 in the case of chemicals with a high level of concern the regulation calls for progressive substitution unless no alternative can be found in these cases authorization of the chemicals will be required 

  

ppg has established a dedicated organization to manage reach implementation we have continued to review of our product portfolio worked closely with our suppliers to assure their commitment to register substances in our key raw materials and begun preparation for registration of substances in ppg manufactured or imported raw materials we will continue to work with our suppliers to understand the future availability and viability of the raw materials we use in our production processes 

  

compliance with the reach legislation will result in increased costs due to registration costs product testing and reformulation risk characterization and participation in substance information exchange forums “siefs” required to coordinate registration dossier preparation ppg identified 10 substances that required registration in 2010 and engaged with other key companies through siefs to develop the required registration dossiers the costs for 2013 and 2018 registrations and potential additional future testing in support of 2010 registrations are currently unclear however our current estimate of the total spend during 20112018 is in the range of 25 million to 40 million we anticipate that some current raw materials and products will be subject to the reach 

  

 authorization process and believe that we will be able to demonstrate adequate risk management for the use and application of the majority of such substances 

  

research and development 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 408 million 403 million and 468 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs totaled approximately 3 of sales in each year of the period from 2008 to 2010 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes additional process and product research and development work is also undertaken at many of the company’s manufacturing plants as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china we have obtained government funding of a small portion of the company’s research efforts and we will continue to pursue government funding because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg earned 58 million in 2010  45 million in 2009 and 52 million in 2008 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

  

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

  

nonus operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

our sales generated by products sold in the developed and emerging regions of the world over the past three years are summarized below 

  

   

seasonality 

ppg’s earnings are typically greater in the second and third quarters and cash flow from operations is greatest in the fourth quarter due to enduse market seasonality primarily in ppg’s architectural coatings businesses demand for ppg’s architectural coatings products is typically strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in north america and europe this higher activity level results in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash flow 

  

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg at december 31 2010 was 38300 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

  

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 16 million 27 million and 15 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2011 will be in the range of 15  20 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

  

ppg completed the conversion of its lake charles la mercury cell chloralkali unit to membrane cell technology in 2007 ppg currently operates one remaining mercury cell production unit located in natrium wva this unit constitutes approximately 4 of ppg’s total chloralkali production capacity 

  

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 106 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 22 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has 

  

 established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of december 31 2010 and 2009 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 272 million and 287 million respectively of which 83 million and 59 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2010 2009 and 2008 totaled 21 million 11 million and 15 million respectively cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 34 million 24 million and 24 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the impact of foreign currency translation decreased the liability by 2 million in 2010 and increased the liability by 1 million in 2009 environmental remediation of a former chromium manufacturing plant site and associated sites in jersey city nj which we refer to as “new jersey chrome” represents the major part of our existing reserves included in the amounts mentioned above were 168 million and 188 million in reserves at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively associated with all new jersey chromium sites 

  

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

  

our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites these charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding 2006 pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 35 million per year for the past 15 years we anticipate that charges against income in 2011 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range 

  

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters 

  

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible these concerns were reflected in the 2005 framework for ghg reduction under the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfccc” the kyoto protocol was adopted by many countries where ppg operates including the european union and canada though not by the us the european union implemented a cap and trade approach with a mandatory emissions trading scheme for ghgs in december 2007 delegates to the unfccc reached agreement on development of a plan for the second phase of kyoto which culminated in the copenhagen accord in december 2009 the copenhagen accord requires annex i parties economically developed countries to further strengthen the emission reductions initiated by the kyoto protocol by submitting economywide emission targets for 2020 ppg has operations in many of these countries however there are indications that some influential annex 1 and nonannex 1 countries may decide to reduce their emission targets or forego signing the accord thereby putting the future of the entire climate change convention into question 

  

a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity took place during 2009 as a result of a us supreme court ruling in april 2007 declaring that ghgs are air pollutants covered by the clean air act the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” proposed and later finalized in december 2009 an endangerment finding that ghg emissions “threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations” based on the endangerment finding the usepa proposed then finalized new “tailored” thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act new source review and title v operating permit programs would be required for new or existing industrial facilities these rules impose new permit requirements on ppg facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year as well as on new equipment installations that will emit more than 75000 tons of ghgs per year the us federal government has committed to a 17 economywide emission reduction target below 2005 levels by 2020 the potential impact on ppg of the implementation of these requirements will not be known until related guidelines are proposed and finalized 

  

with the enactment of usepa’s own ghg reporting verification and permitting regulations ppg made the decision to withdraw from the u s based climate registry program with formal regulations in place ppg no longer saw sufficient value in continuing to belong and pay dues to the voluntary program also in 2010 usepa announced their decision to disband their own voluntary climate leaders program of which ppg had been a 

  

 member ppg has and will continue to annually report our global ghg emissions to the voluntary climate disclosure project which has ranked ppg as a leader in emissions disclosures and reduction 

  

energy prices and supply continue to be a concern for major energy users since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation we committed under the business roundtable’s climate resolve program to reduce our ghg intensity ghgs produced per million dollars of revenue by 18 between 2002 and 2012 ppg achieved this target in 2006 six years ahead of schedule additionally in 2007 ppg announced new corporate targets namely i a reduction in energy intensity by 25 from 2006 to 2016 and ii a 10 absolute reduction in ghg emissions from 2006 to 2011 ppg has joined the us department of energy save energy now leader program reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings chemicals and glass products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business 

  

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy including natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the financial performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each onedollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs in 2010 our natural gas costs on average decreased almost 12 in the us compared to 2009 levels yearoveryear coatings raw material costs increased approximately 210 million following a decline of approximately 150 million in 2009 this increase in costs which was partially linked to increased oil prices later in 2010 was driven by stronger emerging region demand supply disruptions and lack of increased supplier capacity increases occurred in all regions of the world with the most significant impact in north america and europe 

  

we also import raw materials and intermediates particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility our margins are at risk of being lowered 

  

additionally certain raw materials are critical to our production processes these include titanium dioxide solvents and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses lenses sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business and sand clay and soda ash in the glass businesses we have made and plan to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future however an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products and an increase in raw material and energy prices would increase our costs 

  

the lingering effects of the global recession in certain enduse markets could continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the demand for many of our products in europe asia and latin america declined significantly as the impact of the recession which had impacted demand throughout 2008 in the us and uk economies spread globally many global industrial endmarkets remained depressed for most of 2009 the impact of the recession was felt by all of our businesses but most noticeably by those businesses serving the automotive original equipment construction residential and general industrial markets during 2010 the global economy began to mend however the pace of recovery was uneven emerging economies rapidly returned to prerecession levels 

  

 while volume recovery in developed regions was more gradual there was also a contrast in the various enduse markets with global industrial enduse markets demonstrating a rapid and consistent recovery while construction markets particularly commercial and residential in the developed regions and parts of eastern europe remained depressed the outlook for 2011 reflects expectations for the economic recovery to strengthen and broaden the growth rate in emerging regions is expected to moderate somewhat but still easily outpace developed regions it is anticipated that the north american recovery will continue with higher industrial activity and modest improvement in construction markets the recovery rate in europe is expected to once again lag that of asia latin america and north america as export growth moderates and further effects are realized from 2010 austerity measures put in place to ease concerns over european governmental debt loads construction markets in western and eastern europe are forecasted to improve only slightly in 2011 it is anticipated that global industrial activity will grow but at a slower rate than 2010 in many industries remaining at the current low activity levels in the commercial and residential construction markets of the developed regions and eastern europe would continue to result in low demand for many of our products that serve these markets and keep credit risk exposure elevated from customers most impacted by these industries the extent of or the sustainability of the recovery in the global economy or which enduse markets and developed regions will rebound in 2011 is not known 

  

we experience substantial competition from certain lowcost regions 

our flat glass and fiber glass businesses are subject to competition from companies in certain regions of the world including asia eastern europe and latin america where labor costs are lower than those in the us this could result in lower selling prices or reduced demand for some of our flat glass and fiber glass products 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

we have accrued 272 million for estimated environmental remediation costs that are probable at december 31 2010 our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation if necessary of such environmental contingencies and the potential for technological and regulatory developments as such in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million which is a change from the previously reported range of 200 million to 300 million this change in estimate relates principally to the cost of new jersey chrome and legacy glass manufacturing site remediation such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount 

  

for over 30 years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

  

our products are subject to existing and evolving regulations 

regulations concerning the composition and use of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact i the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor ii our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets importexport regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased costs slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains 

  

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region as a result of our expansion outside the us we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in the international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our percentage of sales generated in 2010 by products sold in developing regions including asia eastern europe the middle east africa and latin america was 27 

  

as a producer of commodity chemicals we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature 

we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner however these materials if mishandled or released into the environment could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us in addition evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and 

  

 the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs 

  

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages natural disasters and severe weather events fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

  

the results of any future litigation and the above lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

for over 30 years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed asbestos settlement arrangement see note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

as described in note 16 the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” and the us department of justice conducted an investigation into violations of us export control laws related to the exportation without the required export license of small quantities approximately 1000 gallons of protective coatings for potential use in pakistan in 2006 the company cooperated with the government in this matter the company with the assistance of outside counsel conducted an investigation into these violations of the us export control laws and responded to administrative and federal grand jury subpoenas the company also made disclosures of certain us export control violations to the us department of commerce related to this matter 

  

after reviewing the company’s voluntary selfdisclosure other documents submitted by the company and the findings of its own investigation on december 21 2010 the us attorney’s office for the district of columbia and bis entered into an agreement with the company and the company’s whollyowned chinese subsidiary ppg paints trading shanghai co ltd “spt” to resolve this matter as part of the settlement the company entered into a cooperation and nonprosecution agreement “npa” with the department of justice under which the us attorney’s office for the district of columbia agreed not to bring charges related to this matter against the company or its affiliates except spt as noted below the company is required to meet the conditions of the npa for two years including reporting any future violations and maintaining an ethics and export compliance program the company also agreed to resolve the bis investigation through the payment of a 750000 civil penalty and a commitment to satisfy certain compliance and reporting obligations in addition spt pled guilty in us district court to four charges under us export control laws paid fines of 3 million for civil and criminal violations along with 32319 in criminal forfeitures and will serve five years of corporate probation these costs were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2010 and are reported in other charges in the consolidated statement of income for 2010 

  

over the past several years the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

  

on march 16 2009 ppg received a notice of intent “noi” to file a citizen suit under the federal clean water act from the west virginia rivers coalition and oceana the noi alleges that ppg exceeded permitted discharge limits at its natrium west virginia plant the west virginia department of environmental protection filed suit in state court for the permit exceedances covered by the noi and informed ppg that it intended to seek a civil penalty prior to the expiration of the 60day notice period a lawsuit was filed in state court by the west virginia department of environmental protection “wvdep” for the same alleged violations described in the citizen suit noi blocking the citizen suit for the time being following extensive negotiations with wvdep ppg signed a consent order on june 10 2010 to resolve the lawsuit initiated by the agency which was entered by the court on august 18 2010 the settlement calls for the payment of a cash civil penalty of 102 million in four installments and a commitment to spend an additional 350000 for supplemental environmental projects ppg will also be required to complete certain facility improvements designed to ensure the facility’s compliance with the mercury limits in its water discharge permit by july 2011 which are designed to achieve compliance with the facility’s water discharge permit the 

  

 company has completed a pilot study to evaluate several wastewater treatment technologies for this purpose preliminary engineering design is underway for a treatment system which is currently projected to cost between 4 million and 6 million the company has accrued a reserve of 42 million at december 31 2010 related to this matter 

  

ppg received a consolidated compliance order and notice of proposed penalty “conopp” from the louisiana department of environmental quality “ldeq” in february 2006 alleging violation of various requirements of its lake charles la facility’s air permit based largely upon permit deviations selfreported by ppg the conopp did not contain a proposed civil penalty ppg filed a request for hearing and has engaged ldeq in settlement discussions since 2006 ppg has held discussions with ldeq to try to resolve the conopp in april 2009 ppg offered to settle all of its selfreported air permit deviations through the first half of 2008 for a proposed penalty of 130000 ldeq responded to this settlement offer by asking ppg to make another offer that includes all selfreported air permit deviations through the end of 2009 ppg has increased its offer to settle this matter to 171000

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

performance in 2010 compared with 2009 

  

performance overview 

our sales in 2010 totaled 134 billion compared to 122 billion in 2009 the sales increase totaled 10 sales increased 8 due to higher sales volumes in all reportable segments except architectural coatings  emea reflecting the partial recovery from the impact of the global recession on demand 1 due to higher selling prices and the remainder due to foreign currency and acquisitions 

  

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by 675 million in 2010 to 8214 million compared to 7539 million in 2009 cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 612 in 2010 compared to 616 in 2009 the negative impact of inflation on cost of sales in 2010 was offset by increases in selling prices and lower manufacturing costs the incremental sales volume in 2010 delivered an above average gross margin these factors combined to produce the reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of sales 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 43 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher sales volumes inflation and currency offset partially by specific overhead cost reduction actions selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were 222 in 2010 down from 240 in 2009 

  

during the first quarter of 2009 the company finalized a restructuring plan that was focused on further reducing ppg’s global cost structure the company recorded a charge of 186 million for the cost of these restructuring actions 

  

other charges increased by 19 million due principally to higher environmental remediation expense compared with the prior year 

  

other earnings increased by 36 million in 2010 due primarily to higher equity earnings and royalties offset partially by the absence of gains on nonoperating asset sales that occured in 2009 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2010 was 320 compared to 310 in 2009 the 2010 rate includes expense of 85 million resulting from the reduction of our previously provided deferred tax asset related to our liability for retiree medical costs the deferred tax asset needed to be reduced because the healthcare legislation enacted in march 2010 included a provision that reduces the amount of retiree medical costs that will be deductible after december 31 2012 the 2010 rate also includes a 5 million benefit as a result of enacted changes in statutory tax rates outside the us and a tax benefit of 38 on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the proposed settlement as discussed in note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the rate was approximately 26 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010 

  

the 2009 rate includes a tax benefit of 2 million related to audit settlements and a tax benefit of 245 related to the business restructuring charge the rate for 2009 also includes a tax benefit of 38 on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims the rate was approximately 30 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2009 

  

the decrease in the tax rate on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010 is mainly the result of shifts in the geographic mix of pretax earnings to lower taxed regions of the world 

  

net income attributable to ppg and earnings per share – assuming dilution attributable to ppg for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below 

  

   

  results of reportable business segments 

  

   

performance coatings sales increased 186 million or 5 in 2010 sales improved 3 due to improved pricing and 2 due to the effects of currency along with slight volume increases volume increases in the refinish aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses were offset by a midsingle digit percentage volume decline in the architecturalamericas and asia pacific coatings business segment income in 2010 increased 110 million lead by the automotive refinish protective 

  

 and marine coatings and aerospace businesses the negative earnings impact of inflation was offset by favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs lower overhead costs and the improved margin mix from volume growth in the refinish aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses drove the increased segment earnings 

  

industrial coatings sales increased 640 million or 21 in 2010 sales increased 19 due to higher sales volumes most notably in the automotive oem business and the industrial business’s emerging regions reflecting the gradual recovery from the global recession sales also increased due to favorable pricing and the impact of foreign currency translation segment income improved 219 million in 2010 including about 260 million due to increased volumes partially offset by the negative impact of inflation net of increases in selling prices and lower manufacturing and overhead costs 

  

architectural coatings  emea sales decreased 78 million or 4 in 2010 sales decreased 4 due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation a midsingle digit percentage decline in sales volume was offset by increases in selling prices and the impact of acquisitions segment income decreased 15 million in 2010 the earnings impact of lower sales volumes and mix combined with inflation were not fully offset by lower overhead costs and higher selling prices 

  

optical and specialty materials sales increased 139 million or 14 in 2010 due primarily to increased volumes in both the optical and silicas businesses segment income increased 72 million in 2010 the increase in segment income was primarily the result of higher sales volumes which was partially offset by higher selling and advertising costs to support the increased optical volumes 

  

commodity chemicals sales increased 161 million or 13 in 2010 sales improved 15 due to higher volumes partially offset by a 3 decline in pricing for the year the impact of foreign currency translation was slightly positive segment income increased 37 million in 2010 due to higher volumes as well as favorable manufacturing and overhead costs factors that contributed to offsetting some of the earnings improvement were lower pricing and cost inflation 

  

glass sales increased 136 million or 16 in 2010 the increase in sales was due to higher sales volumes in the fiber glass business partially offset by lower flat glass pricing segment income increased 113 million in 2010 due to the higher fiber glass sales volumes lower manufacturing costs and higher equity earnings partially offset by lower flat glass pricing 

  

outlook 

in 2010 the global economy continued to mend from the severe recession that began during 2008 and continued through most of 2009 the pace of recovery was uneven with emerging economies rapidly returning to prior activity levels while volume recovery in many developed economies has been gradual and has not yet returned to 2008 levels there was also a contrast in the pace of recovery by endmarket global industrial endmarkets which were some of the most significantly impacted endmarkets during the recession demonstrated a more rapid and consistent recovery throughout the year in nearly all regions activity levels in construction markets in the developed regions remained challenging but rose in many emerging regions despite the recovery activity levels in most developed regions still remain well below prerecession levels while emerging regions are at or above prerecession levels after falling in 2009 due to the recession global prices of energy and many related commodities rose in 2010 in recognition of the stronger demand from the gradual economic recovery while supplies of many materials were tight 

  

the north american economy generally followed the global trends with improving industrial activity including nearly 40 percent growth in automotive oem production versus a recessionimpacted 2009 automotive production and sales levels were very consistent throughout the year construction markets in north america showed initial signs of a potential recovery early in the year but demand faded and annual activity levels were negative once again in both the residential and commercial construction segments recovery was evident in other endmarkets such as aerospace transportation and consumer products despite the improved economic pace several factors limited further recovery including the us unemployment rate which remained at a high historical level and a focus on limiting governmental spending and debt loads including the removal of economic stimulus actions instituted during the recession 

  

the rate of recovery in the european economy in 2010 underperformed in comparison with most other major economies led by recurring concerns over governmental spending and the ability to sustain or refinance government debt loads several major european countries initiated significant austerity measures to reign in spending and maintain access to the debt markets eastern european activity levels were mixed with several countries returning to a growth bias while others remained mired in the recession unemployment levels in most countries in the region remained high and the effects of the austerity measures were not fully reflected given that most of them were only beginning to be implemented in the latter stages of 2010 one area where improvement was realized was in higher industrial exports from the region 

  

many of the major emerging economies in which we participate such as asia and latin america maintained late 2009 economic momentum and grew throughout 2010 in many cases surpassing prerecession economic activity levels industrial growth rates remained high including midteen percentage growth in china as 

  

 exports were coupled with higher local consumption other regions such as latin america and india also delivered rapid growth throughout the year these strong growth rates have resulted in some governmental actions to remove previous economic stimulus programs or to dampen the rate of rapid growth some initiatives were also a reflection of concerns over inflation driven by the rapid growth 

  

entering 2011 the expectation is for economic recovery to strengthen and broaden in most endmarkets and most regions the growth rate in emerging regions is expected to moderate somewhat but still easily outpace the developed regions it is anticipated that the north american recovery will continue with higher industrial activity and construction markets no longer acting as a headwind the recovery rate in europe in 2011 is expected to once again lag that of asia latin america and north america as export growth moderates and further impacts are realized from the 2010 austerity measures 

  

in the middle of 2010 commodity and oil prices began to inflate and it is anticipated that these prices will remain at elevated levels during 2011 ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials used in many of our businesses factors which impact our input prices are supplydemand imbalances global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs lower activity levels in 2009 resulted in a decline of 150 million in our coatings raw material costs and the economic recovery in 2010 resulted in an approximate 210 million increase in these costs primarily in the second half of the year we also had inflation in 2008 and 2007 of 150 million and 40 million respectively our current forecast for the early portion of 2011 is for persistent raw material inflation to continue given the volatile supplydemand energy cost and currency environment it is not feasible to project full year raw material pricing 

  

changes in natural gas pricing have a significant impact on the financial performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each one dollar change in our unit price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs our 2010 natural gas costs averaged nearly 550 per mmbtu for the year while our 2009 costs averaged about 615 per unit we currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2011 will be between 500 and 525 per mmbtu we currently have about 12 of full year 2011 us natural gas needs hedged at a price of about 750 per unit from hedges placed prior to 2010 including about 18 of our first quarter needs at a price of about 800 per unit we have additional hedges for the first quarter equating to an additional 10 percent of needs and additional hedges for the hurricane months of august through october representing roughly 12 of our needs which were contracted more recently at closer to current spot pricing which is about 450 per unit while it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we will continue to use a variety of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging 

  

in an effort to offset the impacts of energy and raw materials cost inflation on earnings during 2010 ppg initiated higher selling prices in all operating segments the company has historically raised selling prices to counteract the negative earnings impact from this inflation the higher pricing did not fully counter inflation in our coatings segments in the second half of 2010 which resulted in margin compression in these segments however reflecting strong demand commodity chemicals pricing improved throughout the year and served as an offset to the higher overall inflation for ppg late in the year additional pricing efforts are underway for 2011 in all of our reporting segments to address the inflation we experienced in the second half of 2010 we intend to supplement these sales gains with continued cost actions as necessary to fully offset the earnings impact of raw material cost inflation 

  

our pension and postretirement benefit costs were 258 million in 2010 a decrease of about 69 million from 2009 these costs are expected to decline in 2011 by about 20 million to 30 million including the benefit of our january 2011 plan design change during 2010 and 2009 ppg’s contributions to our pension plans totaled about 340 million and 450 million respectively and we anticipate 2011 contributions will be in the range of 100 million to 125 million 

  

the company announced significant restructuring actions in both the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 in recognition of recessiondriven lower demand levels that focused on reducing our cost structure including actions associated with achieving the synergies from the integration of the acquired sigmakalon business the total annual savings from these fully completed actions is about 250 million including incremental realized savings in 2010 of about 100 million these actions are complete and all of the savings were realized by the end of 2010 

  

we expect our ongoing tax rate in 2011 to be in the range of 26 to 27 consistent with the 2010 rate the reduction we have achieved in 2010 in our ongoing tax rate reflects our sales and earnings growth outside the us where corporate income tax rates are lower particularly in asiapacific and europe 

  

the current global economic outlook for 2011 reflects a broadening of the current recovery as such ppg expects to see higher demand in 2011 compared with 2010 but intends to remain focused on continued cost management the company also entered 2011 with about 2 billion in cash and shortterm investments which is a historically high level 

  

 for the company and includes proceeds from a 1 billion debt offering in november of 2010 despite the recession the company’s cash generation has been consistent and at or near record levels the past three years a stronger operating focus has resulted in lower operating working capital over that same time period the strengthening economic recovery our broad geographic footprint the reductions we have made in our cost structure and our substantial financial flexibility give us optimism regarding the company’s prospects for 2011

performance in 2009 compared with 2008 

  

performance overview 

our sales in 2009 totaled 122 billion compared to 158 billion in 2008 the sales decrease totaled 23 sales decreased 13 due to lower sales volumes in all reportable segments reflecting the adverse impact of the global recession on demand 4 due to weaker foreign currency 5 due to the absence of sales from the divested automotive glass and services business and 1 due to lower selling prices 

  

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased by 2616 million in 2009 to 7539 million compared to 10155 million in 2008 cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 616 in 2009 compared to 641 in 2008 cost of sales in 2008 includes 94 million for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory the reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was due to our higher margin coatings businesses being a larger portion of our total 2009 results favorable manufacturing cost efficiency and favorable price net of inflation 

  

selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 496 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower sales volumes specific overhead cost reduction actions taken in response to the decline in the global economy the impact of foreign currency translation and the absence of the 2008 charge of 19 million for special termination benefits and a pension curtailment loss relating to the sale of the automotive glass and services business 

  

depreciation expense decreased by 74 million in 2009 due to the impact of foreign currency translation our restructuring actions and the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business research and development costs decreased by 63 million in 2009 largely due to cost reduction efforts and the impact of foreign currency translation interest expense decreased by 61 million in 2009 reflective of the lower debt balances and lower interest rates in 2009 

  

during the first quarter of 2009 the company finalized a restructuring plan that is focused on further reducing ppg’s global cost structure the company recorded a charge of 186 million for the cost of this restructuring during the third quarter of 2008 the company finalized a restructuring plan that is part of implementing ppg’s global transformation strategy and the integration of its acquisition of sigmakalon the company recorded a charge of 163 million for the cost of this restructuring 

  

other earnings increased by 13 million in 2009 due primarily to the impact of gains on nonoperating asset sales 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2009 was 310 compared to 313 in 2008 the 2009 rate includes a tax benefit of 2 million related to audit settlements the 2009 rate also includes a tax benefit of 245 related to the business restructuring charge and a tax benefit of 38 related to the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the proposed asbestos settlement as discussed in note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the tax rate was approximately 30 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2009 

  

the 2008 rate includes a tax benefit of 14 million related to the settlement with the internal revenue service of our us tax returns for tax years 2004 2005 and 2006 the 2008 rate also includes a total net tax benefit of 265 on costs related to the acquisition of sigmakalon the charges for the catchup of depreciation expense and the impact of benefit changes related to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business the business restructuring charge the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement and the gain on divestiture of the automotive glass and services business the tax rate was approximately 31 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2008 

  

 net income attributable to ppg and earnings per share – assuming dilution attributable to ppg for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below 

  

   

       

results of reportable business segments 

  

   

performance coatings sales decreased 621 million or 13 in 2009 sales declined 13 as a result of lower sales volumes particularly in the automotive refinish business and architectural coatings – americas and asiapacific businesses the volume decline in automotive refinish was most pronounced in the us and europe while the decline in architectural coatings was mainly in the us and latin america weaker foreign currency also reduced sales by 3 sales increased 3 due to improved pricing segment income in 2009 decreased 31 million including a decline of 24 million due to currency the earnings impact of lower sales volume was largely offset by favorable pricing and lower overhead manufacturing and input costs 

  

industrial coatings sales decreased 931 million or 23 in 2009 sales decreased 21 due to lower sales volumes most notably in the automotive oem and industrial businesses reflecting the severe decline in demand resulting from the global recession volume declines in the segment occurred in all major regions sales also declined 3 due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation sales increased 1 due to increased selling prices segment income declined 53 million in 2009 the decline in earnings due to lower volumes was about 320 million factors increasing segment income were lower overhead manufacturing and input costs and improved selling prices 

  

architectural coatings – emea sales decreased 297 million or 13 in 2009 sales decreased 9 due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and 7 from lower sales volumes sales increased 3 due to increased selling prices segment income decreased 13 million in 2009 including 19 million due to currency the earnings impact of lower sales volumes and inflation were more than offset by lower overhead costs and higher selling prices and other income 

  

optical and specialty materials sales decreased 132 million or 12 in 2009 sales decreased 10 due to volume in part reflecting strong 2008 volumes associated with the launch of transitions optical’s next generation lens product in north america volumes were also lower in the silicas business as a result of the slowdown in the automotive oem market sales declined 2 due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation segment income decreased 9 million in 2009 the decrease in segment income was primarily the result of lower sales volumes which was partially offset by lower manufacturing and overhead costs 

  

commodity chemicals sales decreased 564 million or 31 in 2009 sales declined 21 due to lower selling prices 9 due to lower sales volumes and 1 due to currency segment income decreased 188 million in 2009 due to the negative impact of lower selling prices and volumes factors that contributed to offsetting some of the earnings decline were lower input costs particularly energy lower overhead costs and higher other income 

  

glass sales decreased 1065 million or 56 in 2009 about 725 million of the sales decrease was due to the divestiture of a majority interest in the automotive glass and services business which was completed in september 2008 the remaining decrease in sales was due mainly to lower sales volumes in the flat glass and fiber glass businesses reflecting reduced construction and general industrial demand and to a lesser extent weaker foreign currency and lower selling prices segment income decreased 109 million 

  

 in 2009 with 16 million due to the absence of earnings from the divested automotive glass and services business the remaining decline in segment earnings was due to the negative impact of lower sales volumes and lower selling prices lower overhead manufacturing and input costs positively impacted segment income

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement and a description of the antitrust suits against ppg related to the flat glass industry 

  

as discussed in item 3 and note 16 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 16 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 

  

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 272 million and 287 million respectively of which 83 million and 59 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2010 2009 and 2008 totaled 21 million 11 million and 15 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 34 million 24 million and 24 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the impact of foreign currency decreased the liability by 2 million in 2010 and increased the liability by 1 million in 2009 

  

in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million which is a change from the previously reported range of 200 million to 300 million this change in estimate relates principally to the cost of new jersey chrome and legacy glass manufacturing site remediation such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and at the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites these charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding 2006 pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 35 million per year for the past 15 years we anticipate that charges against income in 2011 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range 

  

management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately 80 million in 2011 and to range from 50 million to 70 million annually through 2014 it is possible that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays specifically the level of expected cash outlays and charges for environmental remediation costs are highly dependent upon activity related to the former chromium manufacturing plant site in new jersey as ppg awaits approval of work plans that have been submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies 

  

impact of inflation 

in 2010 ppg experienced a reduction in its primary energy costs but a steady increase in its coatings raw material costs most notably in the second half of the year this was driven by higher global demand as a result of the gradual recovery in the global economy and tightness of supply as suppliers have not increased their capacities this impact was offset by higher selling prices in our performance coatings and architectural coatings  emea reportable segments and partially offset in our industrial coatings reportable segment industrial coatings partially addressed the remaining impact of raw material inflation 

  

 with further cost reductions in 2010 the impact of inflation net of price was positive in the optical and specialty materials reportable segment and negative in the commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments 

  

in 2009 ppg experienced a reduction in our energy and raw material costs following the significant increases in these costs experienced in 2008 and 2007 which was driven by lower global demand as a result of the recession and the delayed impact of lower oil prices this impact was largely offset by reductions in our selling prices the impact of inflation net of price was negative in our commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments and was positive in our three coatings and the optical and specialty materials reportable segments 

  

in 2008 through increased selling prices ppg was able to more than offset the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs in our commodity chemicals reportable segment the increase in our costs due to inflation was more than offset by higher selling prices in our performance coatings and optical and specialty materials reportable segments the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was offset by higher selling prices however in our industrial coatings and glass reportable segments the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not offset by higher selling prices 

  

in 2011 we expect the costs in all our reportable segments to increase due to the negative effects of inflation most notably the cost of certain raw materials in our coatings segments as a result of increases in global demand for these materials without an associated increase in supply we will continue our efforts to manage our energy costs we will also continue our efforts to manage our material costs through product reformulation and qualification of additional suppliers particularly those from lower cost regions of the world we expect those efforts combined with increases in our selling prices will offset the negative impact of inflation in 2011 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

  

cash from operating activities was 1310 million 1345 million and 1437 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively higher earnings increased cash from operations in 2010 compared to 2009 cash provided by working capital was greater in 2009 than 2010 and that decline more than offset the cash from higher 2010 earnings 

  

operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents 1 trade receivables net of the allowance for doubtful accounts plus 2 inventories on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis less 3 trade creditor’s liability see note 4 “working capital detail” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the components of the company’s operating working capital we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses operating working capital at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 26 billion and 27 billion respectively a key metric we are using to measure improvement in our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales fourth quarter sales annualized 

  

   

the change in operating working capital elements excluding the impact of currency was a reduction of 55 million during the year ended december 31 2010 this reduction was the net result of an increase in receivables from customers associated with the 2010 increase in sales being more than offset by a larger increase in the trade creditors liability receivables from customers net as a percentage of fourth quarter sales annualized for 2010 was 181 down slightly from 183 for 2009 days sales outstanding decreased to 66 days in 2010 from 67 days in 2009 inventories on a fifo basis as a percentage of fourth quarter sales annualized for 2010 was 131 down from 142 for 2009 inventory turnover was 5 times in 2010 and 4 times in 2009 

  

total capital spending was 341 million 265 million and 2056 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was 307 million 239 million and 383 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and is expected to be in the range of 375425 million during 2011 capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to 34 million 26 million and 1673 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and expect to use cash in 2011 to fund bolton acquisitions as part of a balanced deployment of our cash to support growth in earnings 

  

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 360 million 353 million and 343 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899 and 2010 marked the 39th consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders 

  

we did not have a mandatory contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2010 however due in large part to the negative investment return on pension plan assets in 2009 we made voluntary contributions to 

  

 these plans in 2010 totaling 250 million in 2009 and 2008 we made voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans of 360 million of which 100 million was made in ppg stock and 50 million respectively contributions were made to our nonus defined benefit pension plans of 87 million 90 million of which approximately 20 million was made in ppg stock and 69 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively some of which were required by local funding requirements in january of 2011 we made an additional voluntary contribution to our us plans of 50 million and we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in 2011 of approximately 75 million 

  

the company’s share repurchase activity in 2010 2009 and 2008 totaled 81 million shares at a cost of 586 million 15 million shares at a cost of 59 million and 01 million shares at a cost of 7 million respectively 

  

in october of 2009 the company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase up to 12 million shares of the company’s stock of which 11 million shares were purchased in the open market the counterparty held the shares until september of 2010 when the company paid 65 million and took possession of these shares 

  

in december of 2008 the company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase 15 million shares of the company’s stock under the terms of the agreement the counterparty purchased the shares in the open market in january of 2009 and held the shares until december of 2009 when the company paid the agreed upon price of 3953 per share and took possession of these shares the total cost of this share repurchase was approximately 59 million 

  

on january 2 2008 ppg completed the acquisition of sigmakalon a worldwide coatings producer based in uithoorn netherlands from global private investment firm bain capital “the seller” the acquired business produces architectural protective and marine and industrial coatings and is a leading coatings supplier in europe and other key markets across the globe with an increasing presence in africa and asia the total transaction value was approximately 32 billion consisting of cash paid to the seller of 1673 million and debt assumed of 1517 million 

  

on march 18 2008 ppg completed a public offering of 600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 575 notes due 2013 the “2013 notes” 700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 665 notes due 2018 the “2018 notes” and 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 770 notes due 2038 the “2038 notes” and together with the 2013 notes and the 2018 notes the “notes” the notes were offered by the company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement the proceeds of this offering of 1538 million net of discount and issuance costs and additional borrowings of 195 million under a €650 million revolving credit facility were used to repay existing debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of sigmakalon the discount and issuance costs related to the notes which totaled 12 million will be amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the notes 

  

in july 2008 the company entered into an agreement to divest its automotive oem glass and automotive replacement glass and services businesses “automotive glass and services business” under the agreement ppg received a noncontrolling ownership interest in the new company formed by the buyer the transaction was completed on september 30 2008 the company received cash proceeds of 225 million at closing and two sixyear notes totaling 90 million from this transaction 

  

in the fourth quarter 2008 the company monetized certain cross currency foreign exchange swap contracts which had been designated as hedges of our euro denominated net investment in sigmakalon and replaced them with new swap contracts as a result of these swap monetizations the company received 208 million in cash proceeds see item 7a of this form 10k for further information regarding these instruments 

  

in june 2009 ppg entered into a 400 million three year unsecured term loan we used 116 million of the proceeds from this term loan to retire our 705 notes due 2009 the remainder of the loan proceeds of approximately 284 million were used to retire outstanding amounts under our former €650 million revolving credit facility the principal amount of this term loan is due in three years and the interest rate is variable based on a spread over libor 

  

in august 2010 ppg entered into a threeyear credit agreement with several banks and financial institutions the “credit agreement” the credit agreement provides for a 12 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in connection with entering into this credit agreement the company terminated its €650 million and its 1 billion revolving credit facilities that were each set to expire in 2011 there were no outstanding amounts due under either revolving facility at the time of their termination the company has the ability to increase the size of the credit agreement by up to an additional 300 million subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on august 5 2013 

  

on november 12 2010 ppg completed a public offering of 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 1900 notes due 2016 the “2016 notes” 500 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3600 notes due 2020 the “2020 notes” and 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5500 notes due 2040 the “2040 notes” these notes were offered by the company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement the proceeds of this 

  

 offering were 983 million net of discount and issuance costs we intend to use the proceeds to repay our 400 million threeyear unsecured term loan due in 2012 contribute to employee pension plans fund certain asbestos claims and for other general corporate purposes of the company 

  

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 53 at december 31 2010 and 47 at december 31 2009 the increase at year end 2010 is primarily due to the issuance of additional debt during 2010 

  

we continue to believe that our cash on hand cash from operations and the company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities capital spending including acquisitions dividend payments debt service amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table 

  

      

the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases natural gas coal and electricity consistent with customary industry practice these amounts also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 6 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

see note 9 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

  

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which it may issue offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 9 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

  

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 4 “working capital detail” note 14 “income taxes” and note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually see note 15 “pensions and other postretirement 

  

 benefits” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

  

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption at december 31 2010 and for 2011 is 535 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a change in the discount rate of 75 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would impact 2011 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 12 million and 6 million respectively 

  

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2010 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 85 this assumption will be lowered to 80 for 2011 a change in the rate of return of 75 basis points with other assumptions held constant would impact 2011 net periodic pension expense by approximately 21 million 

  

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of december 31 2010 

  

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

  

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

currency 

  

from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 the us dollar strengthened against the euro the polish zloty and the british pound sterling while at the same time it weakened against the canadian and australian dollar the chinese yuan the south korean won and the brazilian real which had a nearly offsetting effect on the translation of the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar a 13 million decrease resulted from translating ppg’s foreign denominated net assets at december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 the impact of translating foreign pretax earnings into us dollars was insignificant 

  

from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the canadian dollar the british pound sterling the polish zloty the brazilian real the south korean won and the australian dollar as a result the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets at december 31 2009 by 173 million compared to december 31 2008 during much of the year the us dollar was stronger against the currencies of many countries in which ppg operates than it was in 2008 which had an unfavorable impact on 2009 pretax earnings of 29 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

  

from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 the us dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling the polish zloty the brazilian real the south korean won and the australian dollar as a result the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar decreased consolidated net assets at december 31 2008 by 499 million compared to december 31 2007 during much of the year the us dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which ppg operates than it was in 2007 which had a favorable impact on 2008 pretax earnings of 45 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

  

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

  

you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “project” “outlook” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company 

  

 undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates fluctuations in tax rates the impact of future legislation the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

  

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 12 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

  

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2010 and 2009 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of december 31 2010 and 2009 were assets of 2 million and liabilities of 3 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 would have been 22 million and 17 million respectively 

  

concurrent with the march 18 2008 completion of the 155 billion public debt offering ppg entered into ten us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 13 billion of which 600 million were to settle on march 15 2013 and 700 million were to settle on march 15 2018 on march 18 2008 ppg paid the counterparties to the contracts a total of 13 billion and received euros which were used to repay most of a €1 billion bridge loan which the company employed to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon during the fourth quarter of 2008 ppg converted 116 billion of these contracts to 208 million of cash and replaced them with new cross currency swap contracts one contract with a notional amount of 140 million and a settlement date of march 15 2018 was converted to cash during the first quarter of 2010 accordingly on settlement of the contracts ppg will receive 12 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts the company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired sigmakalon businesses and as a result mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of 163 million and 308 million respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by 158 million and 182 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 447 million as of december 31 2010 and 723 million as of december 31 2009 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 52 million and 81 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of 20 million and 10 million as of 

  

 december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by  1 million and 3 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately 1 million as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately  115 million and 91 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

  

the company entered into forward starting swaps in the third quarter of 2009 to effectively lockin a fixed interest rate based on the 10year swap rate to which will be added a corporate spread related to future debt refinancings the notional amount of these swaps totaled 250 million in the second quarter of 2010 the company entered into additional forward starting swaps arrangements with a notional amount of 150 million as of december 31 2010 the fair value of these swaps was a liability of 21 million as of december 31 2009 the fair value of these swaps was an asset of 3 million a 10 decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by 14 million and 10 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31 2010 and 2009 was a liability of 31 million and 50 million respectively these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to higher prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by 5 million and 14 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 12 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” and note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of december 31 2010 and 2009 was an asset of 55 million and 18 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of 12 million and 8 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success our primary energy cost is natural gas used in our commodity chemicals and glass businesses in 2009 our natural gas costs continued to be volatile and on average decreased almost 33 percent in the us compared to 2008 levels the decrease can be linked to yearoveryear weak consumption favorable weather and inflated inventories 

  

during 2009 the benefit of lower coatings raw material costs totaled 150 million globally recovering a portion of the raw material cost increases that occurred over the prior three years of 150 million in 2008 40 million in 2007 and 75 million in 2006 many of our coatings raw materials are petroleum based and changes in pricing for these raw materials traditionally lag oil price fluctuations by several months our costs are also dependent on global supply and demand for these materials which can vary by geographic region sluggish global demand resulting from the economic recession combined with overcapacity and high inventory levels caused our raw material costs to decline in 2009 particularly in the first half of the year during the fourth quarter of 2009 we experienced some cost increases as demand improved gradually and supplier inventories contracted 

  

the company’s most significant raw materials are titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses lenses sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass businesses most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company has aggressive sourcing initiatives underway to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest total material costs these initiatives include reformulation of certain of our products using both petroleum derived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy another initiative is to qualify multiple sources of supply including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals that impact or could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards 

  

in december 2006 the european union “eu” member states adopted a new comprehensive chemical management legislation known as “reach” registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach applies to all chemical substances manufactured or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more annually and will require the registration of approximately 30000 chemical substances with the european chemicals agency ppg met the requirements for preregistration of such chemicals that ended on december 1 2008 additionally reach requires the registration of these substances entailing the filing of extensive data on their potential risks to human health and the environment registration activities will occur in three phases over an 11year period based on tonnage and level of concern with the first registration deadline set for december 1 2010 subsequent phases end in 2013 and 2018 in the case of chemicals with a high level of concern the regulation calls for progressive substitution unless no alternative can be found in these cases authorization of the chemicals will be required 

  

ppg has established a dedicated organization to manage reach implementation we have continued review of our product portfolio worked closely with our suppliers to assure their commitment to register substances in our key raw materials and begun preparation for registration of substances in ppg manufactured or imported raw materials we will continue to work with our suppliers to understand the future availability and viability of the raw materials we use in our production processes 

  

compliance with the reach legislation will result in increased costs due to registration costs product testing and reformulation risk characterization and participation in substance information exchange forums “siefs” required to coordinate registration dossier preparation ppg has identified a number of substances that may require 2010 registration and is engaged with other key companies through siefs to develop the required registration dossiers the costs for 2013 and 2018 registrations and potential additional future testing in 

  

   

support of 2010 registrations are currently unclear however our preliminary estimate in total is in the range of 30 million to 45 million we anticipate that some current raw materials and products will be subject to the reach authorization process and believe that we will be able to demonstrate adequate risk management for the use and application of the majority of such substances 

  

the us environmental protection agency “usepa” has formally withdrawn their previously announced program called “champ” chemical assessment and management program this program had been intended to address hazard and risk characterization of chemicals imported or manufactured in the us in quantities above 25000 pounds annually further the usepa announced that champ will be superseded by a comprehensive approach to enhancing the agency’s current chemicals management program 

  

at this time it is not possible to quantify the financial impact of these regulatory initiatives on ppg’s businesses 

  

research and development 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 403 million 468 million and 363 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these costs totaled approximately 3 of sales in each of these years representing a level of expenditure that is expected to continue in 2010 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes additional process and product research and development work is also undertaken at many of the company’s manufacturing plants as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our costs effectively we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in china have outsourcing arrangements with several laboratories and have been actively pursuing government funding of a small but growing portion of the company’s research efforts because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg earned 45 million in 2009  52 million in 2008 and 48 million in 2007 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

  

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

  

nonus operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations and as a result we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 75 of sales and operating income is generated by products sold in the united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and latin america 

  

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2009 was 39900 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

  

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 27 million 15 million and 16 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2010 will be in the range of 2025 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

  

ppg completed the conversion of its lake charles la mercury cell chloralkali unit to membrane cell technology in 2007 ppg currently operates one remaining mercury cell production unit located in natrium wva this unit constitutes approximately 4 of ppg’s total chloralkali production capacity 

  

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 104 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 22 sites on the national priority list while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company 

  

   

has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of december 31 2009 and 2008 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 287 million and 299 million respectively of which 59 million and 44 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2009 2008 and 2007 totaled 11 million 15 million and 12 million respectively cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 24 million 24 million and 19 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively as part of the allocation of the sigmakalon purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the reserve for environmental contingencies was increased by 37 million in 2008 the impact of foreign currency translation increased the liability by 1 million in 2009 and decreased the liability by 5 million in 2008 environmental remediation of a former chromium manufacturing plant site and associated sites in jersey city nj represents the major part of our existing reserves included in the amounts mentioned above were 188 million and 193 million in reserves at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively associated with all new jersey chromium sites 

  

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

  

our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites these charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding 2006 pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year for the past 15 years we anticipate that charges against income in 2010 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range 

  

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters 

  

public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible these concerns were reflected in the 2005 framework for ghg reduction under the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfccc” the kyoto protocol was adopted by many countries where ppg operates including the european union and canada though not in the us the european union implemented a cap and trade approach with a mandatory emissions trading scheme for ghgs in december 2007 delegates to the unfccc reached agreement on development of a plan for the second phase of kyoto which culminated in the copenhagen accord in december 2009 the copenhagen accord requires annex i parties economically developed countries to further strengthen the emission reductions initiated by the kyoto protocol by submitting economywide emission targets for 2020 ppg has operations in many of these countries however there are indications that some influential annex 1 and nonannex 1 countries may decide to reduce their emission targets or forego signing the accord thereby putting the future of the entire climate change convention into question 

  

a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has taken place during 2009 as a result of a us supreme court ruling in april 2007 declaring that ghgs are air pollutants covered by the clean air act the usepa proposed and later finalized in december 2009 an endangerment finding that ghg emissions “threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations” based on the endangerment finding the usepa proposed new “tailored” thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act new source review and title v operating permit programs would be required for new or existing industrial facilities as proposed the rules would impose new permit requirements on ppg facilities emitting more than 25000 tons of ghgs per year the us federal government has committed to a 17 economywide emission reduction target below 2005 levels by 2020 the potential impact of these proposed regulations on ppg will not be known until they are finalized 

  

ppg is a member of the usbased climate registry an organization that sets standards to calculate verify and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions into a single registry the registry assists in verification of current and future ppg ghg reduction achievements in preparation for potential imposition in the us of ghg reduction goals ppg is also a member of the usepa’s climate leaders program which works with companies to develop comprehensive climatechange strategies in addition 

  

   

ppg has been recognized by the climate disclosure project as a leader in emissions disclosure and reduction 

  

energy prices and supply continue to be a concern for major energy users since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation we committed under the business roundtable’s climate resolve program to reduce our ghg intensity ghgs produced per million dollars of revenue by 18 between 2002 and 2012 ppg achieved this target in 2006 six years ahead of schedule additionally in 2007 ppg announced new corporate targets namely i a reduction in energy intensity by 25 from 2006 to 2016 and ii a 10 absolute reduction in ghg emissions from 2006 to 2011 ppg has joined the us department of energy save energy now leader program reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the company’s progress in this area

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings glass and chemicals products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business 

  

the global recession and credit crisis could continue to have negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the demand for many of our products in europe asia and latin america declined significantly as the impact of the recession which had impacted demand throughout 2008 in the us and uk economies spread globally many global industrial endmarkets remained depressed for most of 2009 the impact of the recession was felt by all of our businesses but most noticeably by those businesses serving the automotive original equipment construction housing and general industrial markets entering 2010 the global economic outlook reflects expectations of gradual yearoveryear improvement in many industrial sectors but the breadth and pace of the recovery is uncertain anticipation is for growth to continue in most asian economies driven by these global demand improvements modest recovery is expected to continue in the north american economy with some offsets due to later economic cycle sectors such as commercial construction which is projected to continue to decline the recovery rate of the european economy is expected to lag both asia and north america a source of concern is the anticipation that various government stimulus programs will gradually be removed without a consensus conviction that consumer spending in these countries will provide an offset to support the recovery continued weakness in the global economy would be expected to result in lower demand for many of our products and increase our exposure to credit risk from customers in the industries most impacted by the weak economy how strongly the rebound of the global economy takes hold or if the signs of recovery will last is not known 

  

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy including natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each onedollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs in 2009 our natural gas costs on average decreased almost 33 in the us compared to 2008 levels yearoveryear coatings raw material costs declined by approximately 150 million in 2009 following a rise of approximately 150 million in 2008 this increase in costs which was partially linked to increased oil prices occurred in all regions of the world with the most significant impact in the us whether oil prices and our raw material costs will increase in 2010 is not known 

  

we also import raw materials particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the 

  

   

currency of the supplier and therefore our margins are at risk of being lowered if those foreign currencies strengthen against the local currencies of our manufacturing facilities 

  

additionally certain raw materials are critical to our production processes these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses lenses photochromic dye sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses we have made and plan to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future however an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products 

  

we experience substantial competition from certain lowcost regions 

growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world including asia eastern europe and latin america where energy and labor costs are lower than those in the us could result in lower selling prices or reduced demand for some of our glass and fiber glass products 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

we have accrued 287 million for estimated environmental remediation costs that are probable at december 31 2009 our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation if necessary of such environmental contingencies and the potential for technological and regulatory developments as such in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 300 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount 

  

for over 30 years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

  

our products are subject to existing and evolving regulations 

regulations concerning the composition and use of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact i the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor ii our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets 

  

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

because we are a global company our results are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 75 of sales and operating income in 2009 was generated by products sold in the united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and latin america 

  

as a producer of chemicals we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature 

we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner however these materials if mishandled or released into the environment could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us in addition evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs 

  

we sell products to global and regional automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers 

the economic downturn caused declines in global production of automobiles and light trucks which adversely impacted our sales volumes while the automotive market experienced higher and more consistent production and sales levels in the second half of 2009 the overall market still remained at a very low activity level 

  

the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change including the loss of us market share by general motors and chrysler during 2009 both companies emerged from bankruptcy with the assistance of equity infusions by the us government these developments have mitigated any potential credit exposure we may face however we remain focused on the continual management of automotive customer credit risk as further deterioration of market conditions could 

  

   

cause additional liquidity problems potentially resulting in the writeoff of amounts due from these customers and cost impacts of changing suppliers 

  

additionally the same economic conditions that are impacting our continuing businesses that serve the automotive original equipment manufacturer “oem” market are affecting the divested automotive glass and services business in which ppg maintains an approximate 40 percent interest 

  

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages natural disasters and severe weather events fires war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s current and past business activities to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

  

the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

for over 30 years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed asbestos settlement arrangement see note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

   

over the past several years the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

  

a notice of intent “noi” to file a citizen suit under the federal clean water act has been received by ppg from the west virginia rivers coalition and oceana the noi alleges that ppg exceeded permitted discharge limits at its natrium west virginia plant the west virginia department of environmental protection filed suit in state court for the permit exceedances covered by the noi and informed ppg that it intended to seek a civil penalty prior to the expiration of the 60day notice period a lawsuit was filed in state court by the west virginia department of environmental protection “wvdep” for the same alleged violations described in the citizen suit noi blocking the citizen suit for the time being ppg is in the process of negotiating with wvdep in an attempt to settle this matter in ppg’s experience resolution of matters such as these is difficult to predict 

  

ppg has received a consolidated compliance order and notice of proposed penalty “conopp” from the louisiana department of environmental quality “deq” alleging violation of various requirements of its lake charles la facility’s air permit based largely upon permit deviations selfreported by ppg the conopp did not contain a proposed civil penalty ppg filed a request for hearing and has engaged deq in settlement discussions in ppg’s experience resolution of such matters is difficult to predict

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

performance in 2009 compared with 2008 

  

performance overview 

our sales in 2009 totaled 122 billion compared to 158 billion in 2008 the sales decrease totaled 23 sales decreased 13 due to lower sales volumes in all reportable segments reflecting the adverse impact of the global recession on demand 4 due to weaker foreign currency 5 due to the absence of sales from the divested automotive glass and services business and 1 due to lower selling prices 

  

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased by 2616 million in 2009 to 7539 million compared to 10155 million in 2008 cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 616 in 2009 compared to 641 in 2008 cost of sales in 2008 includes 94 million for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory the reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was due to our higher margin coatings businesses being a larger portion of our total 2009 results favorable manufacturing cost efficiency and favorable price net of inflation 

  

selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 496 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower sales volumes specific overhead cost reduction actions taken in response to the decline in the global economy the impact of foreign currency translation and the absence of the 2008 charge of 19 million for special termination benefits and a pension curtailment loss relating to the sale of the automotive glass and services business 

  

depreciation expense decreased by 74 million in 2009 due to the impact of foreign currency translation our restructuring actions and the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business research and development costs decreased by 63 million in 2009 largely due to cost reduction efforts and the impact of foreign currency translation interest expense decreased by 61 million in 2009 reflective of the lower debt balances and lower interest rates in 2009 

  

  

during the first quarter of 2009 the company finalized a restructuring plan that is focused on further reducing ppg’s global cost structure the company recorded a charge of 186 million for the cost of this restructuring during the third quarter of 2008 the company finalized a restructuring plan that is part of implementing ppg’s global transformation strategy and the integration of its acquisition of sigmakalon the company recorded a charge of 163 million for the cost of this restructuring 

  

other earnings increased by 13 million in 2009 due primarily to the impact of gains on nonoperating asset sales 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2009 was 310 compared to 313 in 2008 the 2009 rate includes a tax benefit of 2 million related to audit settlements the 2009 rate also includes a tax benefit of 245 related to the business restructuring charge and a tax benefit of 385 related to the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the proposed asbestos settlement as discussed in note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the tax rate was approximately 30 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2009 

  

the 2008 rate includes a tax benefit of 14 million related to the settlement with the internal revenue service of our us tax returns for tax years 2004 2005 and 2006 the 2008 rate also includes a total net tax benefit of 265 on costs related to the acquisition of sigmakalon the charges for the catchup of depreciation expense and the impact of benefit changes related to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business the business restructuring charge the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement and the gain on divestiture of the automotive glass and services business the tax rate was approximately 31 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2008 

  

net income attributable to ppg and earnings per share – assuming dilution attributable to ppg for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below 

  

   

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

       

results of reportable business segments 

  

   

performance coatings sales decreased 621 million or 13 in 2009 sales declined 13 as a result of lower sales volumes particularly in the automotive refinish business and architectural coatings – americas and asiapacific businesses the volume decline in automotive refinish was most pronounced in the us and europe while the decline in architectural coatings was mainly in the us and latin america weaker foreign currency also reduced sales by 3 sales increased 3 due to improved pricing segment income in 2009 decreased 31 million including a decline of 24 million due to currency the earnings impact of lower sales volume was largely offset by favorable pricing and lower overhead manufacturing and input costs 

  

industrial coatings sales decreased 931 million or 23 in 2009 sales decreased 21 due to lower sales volumes most notably in the automotive and industrial businesses reflecting the severe decline in demand resulting from the global recession volume declines in the segment occurred in all major regions sales also declined 3 due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation sales increased 1 due to increased selling prices segment income declined 53 million in 2009 the decline in earnings due to lower volumes was about 320 million factors increasing segment income were lower overhead manufacturing and input costs and improved selling prices 

  

architectural coatings  emea sales decreased 297 million or 13 in 2009 sales decreased 9 due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and 7 from lower sales volumes sales increased 3 due to increased selling prices segment income decreased 13 million in 2009 including 19 million due to currency the earnings impact of lower sales volumes and inflation were more than offset by lower overhead costs and higher selling prices and other income 

  

optical and specialty materials sales decreased 132 million or 12 in 2009 sales decreased 10 due to volume in part reflecting strong 2008 volumes associated with the launch of transitions optical’s next generation lens product in north america volumes were also lower in the silicas business as a result of the slowdown in the automotive oem market sales declined 2 due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation segment income decreased 9 million in 2009 the decrease in segment income was primarily the result of lower sales volumes which was partially offset by lower manufacturing and overhead costs 

  

commodity chemicals sales decreased 564 million or 31 in 2009 sales declined 21 due to lower selling prices 9 due to lower sales volumes and 1 due to currency segment income decreased 188 million in 2009 due to the negative impact of lower selling prices and volumes factors that contributed to offsetting some of the earnings decline were lower input costs particularly energy lower overhead costs and higher other income 

  

glass sales decreased 1065 million or 56 in 2009 about 725 million of the sales decrease was due to the divestiture of a majority interest in the automotive glass and services business which was completed in september 2008 the remaining decrease in sales was due mainly to lower sales volumes in the performance glazings and fiber glass businesses reflecting reduced construction and general industrial demand and to a lesser extent weaker foreign currency and lower selling prices segment income decreased 109 million in 2009 with 16 million 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

due to the absence of earnings from the divested automotive glass and services business the remaining decline in segment earnings was due to the negative impact of lower sales volumes and lower selling prices lower overhead manufacturing and input costs positively impacted segment income 

  

outlook 

in 2009 the global economy was mired in a severe recession which began during 2008 the severity of the recession prompted intervention by many governments to introduce a variety of stimulus measures to stabilize economies and various industries or sectors including the banking sector due to intense global liquidity concerns global industrial endmarkets experienced rapid declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 and many of these markets remained depressed throughout 2009 in addition in late 2008 and early 2009 many industries destocked inventory levels which further reduced manufacturing demand in the latter half of 2009 the majority of this inventory destocking was completed and some endmarkets began to experience gradual demand improvements from what were extremely low levels in comparison with recent history in recognition of the global economic slowdown prices of energy and many related commodities dramatically declined in late 2008 and early 2009 from what were in many cases historically high price levels directly preceding the recession 

  

the north american economy began 2009 at very low activity levels with some industries such as automotive oem down 4050 percent versus the prior year level as a result the us automotive industry experienced a significant retrenchment early in the year and two major auto companies emerged from bankruptcy with the help of extensive government financial aid in the second half of 2009 the automotive market experienced higher and more consistent production and sales levels although the overall market still remained at a very low activity level construction markets continued to weaken as residential construction experienced a third consecutive year of slower demand and commercial construction which grew in 2008 declined swiftly in 2009 this overall declining economic environment resulted in a continued upward shift of the us unemployment rate and further declines in consumer confidence levels toward the end of the year some sectors began to experience a gradual recovery in demand but still remained at levels well below those of 2008 or 2007 

  

the european economy in 2009 experienced similar industrial inventory destocking and demand declines these declines were offset somewhat with strong government stimulus programs targeted at manufacturing including automotive production 

  

the primary asian economies in which we participate started 2009 with low gdp growth largely due to fewer exports as a result of the weak global economy growth levels accelerated toward the middle of 2009 due largely to a variety of focused government stimulus programs in china aimed at increasing local consumption as a result of the success of these programs china’s gdp grew at just below 9 percent for the year despite lower yearoveryear exports also in asiapacific india experienced solid gdp growth exceeding 6 percent and australia grew but at less than 1 percent for the year in total the economies of this region well outperformed those of the other major regions of the world 

  

entering 2010 the overall global economic outlook is cautiously optimistic with expectations of gradual yearoveryear improvement in many industrial sectors it is also anticipated that growth will continue in most asian economies driven by these global demand improvements modest recovery is expected to continue in the north american economy with some offsets due to later economic cycle sectors such as commercial construction which is projected to continue to decline and aerospace the recovery rate in europe in 2010 is expected to lag that of both asia and north america 

  

ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials used in many of our businesses price inflation has resulted from global industrial expansion supplydemand imbalance and increases in supplier feedstock costs price deflation stemmed from lower economic activity and resulting supplydemand imbalances from our suppliers as was the case in 2009 when our coatings raw material costs declined about 150 million following increases of 150 million and 40 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively our current forecast for the early portion of 2010 is for moderate raw material inflation stemming from higher global energy prices in comparison to the full year of 2009 and moderate global economic growth given the volatile supplydemand energy cost and currency environment it is not feasible to project full year raw material pricing but the main drivers will continue to be overall economic conditions and resulting supply and demand factors 

  

changes in natural gas pricing have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each one dollar change in our price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs our 2009 natural gas costs averaged over 600 per mmbtu for the year while our 2008 costs averaged about 900 per unit we currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2010 will be 700 per mmbtu which is roughly equal to the first quarter of 2009 we currently have about 30 of our first quarter 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

2010 us natural gas purchases hedged at a price of about 850 per unit and about 25 of the remainder of 2010 at a price of about 775 per unit the current spot price for natural gas is just below 600 per unit while it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we will continue to use a variety of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging 

  

consistent with deflation in energy costs and because of lower endmarket demand the selling prices and profitability of our commodity chemicals segment dropped severely during 2009 following near alltime high levels in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 us caustic demand weakened because of falling industrial production at the end of the year as customer inventory destocking began to diminish demand and selling prices began to modestly recover 

  

our ongoing pension and postretirement benefit costs were 327 million in 2009 an increase of about 100 million from 2008 these costs are expected to decline in 2010 by about 50 million during 2009 ppg contributions to our pension plans totaled about 450 million and we anticipate 2010 contributions will be about 240 million 

  

the company announced significant restructuring actions in both the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 in recognition of lower demand levels that focused on reducing our cost structure including actions associated with achieving the synergies from the integration of the acquired sigmakalon business the total annual savings from these actions are expected to be about 250 million upon full implementation including incremental savings in 2010 of about 100 million 

  

we expect our tax rate in 2010 to be 30 including a tax benefit of approximately 2 associated with the federal subsidy under medicare part d as described in note 15 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k the tax benefit associated with the medicare part d subsidy could be changed by the healthcare reform legislation currently being considered by congress 

  

the current global economic outlook for 2010 reflects a gradual recovery but that outlook remains somewhat fragile due in part to the uncertainty of whether consumer spending is expected to rise enough to offset the impact of removal of government stimulus spending as such ppg expects to see some recovery in demand in 2010 compared with 2009 and will remain focused on continued effective cost management the company also entered 2010 with 1 billion of cash on hand which is a historically high level for the company and follows an exemplary year of cash generation in 2009 our second highest year of cash generation on record this strong cash performance is a direct result of lower 2009 activity levels a management focus on lowering our working capital and the impact of several years of portfolio changes that diversified our geographic sales mix and broadened our endmarkets served resulting in lower exposure to any individual endmarket or region this ability to generate high levels of cash our prudent deployment of this cash to continuously strengthen the company the expected full year benefit of our recent cost restructuring actions and the expectation of a gradual economic recovery gives us optimism regarding the company’s prospects for 2010

divestiture of automotive glass and services business 

during the third quarter of 2007 the company entered into an agreement to sell its automotive glass and services business to platinum equity “platinum” for approximately 500 million accordingly the assets and liabilities of this business were classified as held for sale and the results of operations and cash flows of this business were classified as discontinued operations as of september 30 2007 in the fourth quarter of 2007 ppg was notified that affiliates of platinum had filed suit in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york alleging that platinum was not obligated to consummate the agreement platinum also terminated the agreement ppg has sued platinum and certain of its affiliates for damages including the 25 million breakup fee stipulated by the terms of the agreement based on various alleged actions of the platinum parties while the transaction with platinum was terminated ppg management remained committed to a sale of the automotive glass and services business and continued to classify its assets and liabilities as held for sale and report its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations through the first quarter of 2008 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

in july 2008 ppg entered into an agreement with affiliates of kohlberg  company llc under which ppg would divest the automotive glass and services business to a new company formed by affiliates of kohlberg under the agreement ppg would receive a noncontrolling interest in the new company and as such the accounting requirements for classifying the business as assets held for sale and reporting its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations had no longer been met the assets and liabilities of the business were classified as held for use in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2007 and the results of operations and cash flows of the business through september 30 2008 have been classified as continuing operations in the glass reportable segment in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under item 8 of this form 10k for the three years ended december 31 2009 

  

in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of the reclassification of the automotive glass and services business to continuing operations ppg recorded a onetime noncash charge of 17 million 11 million aftertax to reflect a catchup of depreciation expense which was suspended when the business was classified as a discontinued operation additionally in the second quarter of 2008 ppg recorded a charge of 19 million 12 million aftertax for special termination benefits and a pension curtailment loss relating to the impact of benefit changes including accelerated vesting negotiated as part of the sale 

  

the transaction with affiliates of kohlberg was completed on september 30 2008 with ppg receiving total proceeds of 315 million including 225 million in cash and two 6year notes totaling 90 million 60 million at 85 interest and 30 million at 10 interest both notes which may be prepaid at any time without penalty are senior to the equity of the new company in addition ppg has received a noncontrolling interest of approximately 40 percent in the new company pittsburgh glass works llc this transaction resulted in a third quarter 2008 gain of 15 million pretax net of transaction costs and is included in “other income” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2008 under item 8 the aftertax gain on the transaction was 3 million reflective of tax expense of 12 million tax expense on the gain includes the tax cost of repatriating certain transaction proceeds from canada to the us and the impact of certain permanent booktax differences which resulted in a larger taxable gain ppg accounts for its interest in pittsburgh glass works llc under the equity method of accounting from october 1 2008 onward ppg has retained certain liabilities for pension and postemployment benefits earned for service up to september 30 2008 

  

divestiture of fine chemicals business 

  

in the third quarter of 2007 ppg entered into an agreement to sell its fine chemicals business to zach system spa a subsidiary of zambon company spa for approximately 65 million the sale of this business was completed in november 2007 the results of operations and cash flows of this business which had previously been included in the optical and specialty materials reportable segment have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under item 8 for the year ended december 31 2007 ppg recorded a pretax loss on sale of the fine chemicals business of 25 million 19 million aftertax in 2007 

  

performance overview 

our sales increased 30 to 158 billion in 2008 compared to 122 billion in 2007 sales increased 28 due to the impact of acquisitions 4 due to increased selling prices and 2 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation these sales increases were offset by a 2 decline due to lower sales volumes and by a 2 decline related to the automotive glass and services business divestiture 

  

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by 2327 million in 2008 to 10155 million compared to 7828 million in 2007 this increase corresponds with the increase in sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 641 in both 2008 and 2007 cost of sales in 2008 includes 94 million for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory related to the sigmakalon acquisition 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 1122 million in 2008 due principally to the impact of the acquisition of sigmakalon selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 217 for 2008 compared to 189 for 2007 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due largely to the addition of sigmakalon and reflects the distribution nature of these businesses which requires higher selling distribution advertising and regional management costs to serve their broad customer profile selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in the architectural coatings  emea reportable segment are in line with ppg’s other architectural coatings businesses other factors causing the increase in these expenses were higher levels of cost to support growth in our coatings and optical businesses higher bad debt expense associated with the impact of the weakening economy on our customers a second quarter charge of 19 million for special termination benefits and foreign currency translation 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

depreciation expense increased by 83 million due primarily to the acquisition of sigmakalon research and development costs increased by 103 million and amortization increased by 77 million compared to 2007 these increases were primarily due to the acquisition of sigmakalon interest expense increased by 161 million in 2008 due to debt incurred to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon 

  

during the third quarter of 2008 the company finalized a restructuring plan that is part of implementing ppg’s global transformation strategy and the integration of its acquisition of sigmakalon the company recorded a charge of 163 million for the cost of this restructuring 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2008 was 313 compared to 291 in 2007 the 2008 rate includes a tax benefit of 14 million related to the settlement with the internal revenue service of our us tax returns for tax years 2004 2005 and 2006 the 2008 rate also includes a total net tax benefit of 265 on costs related to the acquisition of sigmakalon the charges for the catchup of depreciation expense and the impact of benefit changes related to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business the business restructuring charge the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement and the gain on divestiture of the automotive glass and services business the tax rate was approximately 31 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2008 

  

the rate in 2007 includes the benefit of 15 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against the benefit of a tax net operating loss carryforward the benefit associated with an enacted reduction in the canadian federal corporate income tax rate and a tax benefit of 39 on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement the tax rate was 305 on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 was 252 the rate in 2007 included a tax benefit of 24 on the loss on the sale of the fine chemicals business the tax rate was 365 on the remaining pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 

  

net income and earnings per share – assuming dilution for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below 

  

   

         

results of reportable business segments 

  

   

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

performance coatings sales increased 905 million or 24 in 2008 sales increased 21 due to acquisitions largely due to the impact of the sigmakalon protective and marine coatings business sales also grew by 3 due to higher selling prices and 2 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation sales volumes declined 2 as reduced volumes in architectural coatings – americas and asia pacific and automotive refinish were not fully offset by improved volumes in the aerospace and protective and marine businesses volume growth in the aerospace businesses occurred throughout the world while the volume growth in protective and marine coatings occurred primarily in asia segment income increased 19 million in 2008 factors increasing segment income were the positive impact of acquisitions lower overhead costs and the positive impact of foreign currency translation the benefit of higher selling prices more than offset the negative impact of inflation including higher raw materials and benefit costs segment income was reduced by the impact of the lower sales volumes in architectural coatings and automotive refinish which more than offset the benefit of volume gains in the aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses 

  

industrial coatings sales increased 353 million or 10 in 2008 sales increased 11 due to acquisitions including the impact of the sigmakalon industrial coatings business sales also grew 3 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and 1 from higher selling prices sales volumes declined 5 as reduced volumes were experienced in all three businesses reflecting the substantial declines in global demand volume declines in the automotive and industrial businesses were primarily in the us and canada additional volume declines in the european and asian regions were experienced by the industrial coatings business in packaging coatings volume declines in europe were only partially offset by gains in asia and north america segment income declined 158 million in 2008 due to the lower volumes and inflation including higher raw material and freight costs the impact of which was only partially mitigated by the increased selling prices segment income also declined due to higher selling and distribution costs including higher bad debt expense factors increasing segment income were the earnings of acquired businesses the positive impact of foreign currency translation and lower manufacturing costs 

  

architectural coatings  emea sales for the year were 2249 million this business was acquired in the sigmakalon acquisition segment income was 141 million which included amortization expense of 63 million related to acquired intangible assets and depreciation expense of 58 million 

  

  

optical and specialty materials sales increased 105 million or 10 in 2008 sales increased 5 due to higher volumes in our optical products business resulting from the launch of transitions optical’s next generation lens product 3 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and 2 due to increased selling prices segment income increased 9 million in 2008 the increase in segment income was the result of increased sales volumes and the favorable impact of currency partially offset by increased selling and marketing costs in the optical products business related to the transitions optical product launch mentioned above increased selling prices only partially offset higher raw material costs primarily in our silicas business 

  

commodity chemicals sales increased 298 million or 19 in 2008 sales increased 18 due to higher selling prices and 1 due to improved sales volumes segment income increased 97 million in 2008 segment income increased in large part due to higher selling prices which more than offset the negative impact of inflation primarily higher raw material and energy costs segment income also improved due to lower manufacturing costs while lower margin mix and equity earnings reduced segment income 

  

glass sales decreased 281 million or 13 in 2008 sales decreased 11 due to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business in september 2008 and 4 due to lower sales volumes sales increased 2 due to higher selling prices segment income decreased 68 million in 2008 segment income decreased due to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business lower volumes the negative impact of inflation and lower equity earnings from our asian fiber glass joint ventures factors increasing segment income were lower manufacturing costs higher selling prices and stronger foreign currency 

  

see note 25 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the company’s operating segments and reportable business segments 

  

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement and a description of the antitrust suits against ppg related to the flat glass and automotive refinish industries as discussed in item 3 and note 16 although 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 16 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time as of december 31 2009 and 2008 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 287 million and 299 million respectively of which 59 million and 44 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2009 2008 and 2007 totaled 11 million 15 million and 12 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the consolidated statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 24 million 24 million and 19 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively as part of the allocation of the sigmakalon purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the reserve for environmental contingencies was increased by 37 million in 2008 the impact of foreign currency translation increased the liability by 1 million in 2009 and decreased the liability by 5 million in 2008 

  

in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 300 million which range is unchanged since december 31 2008 such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and at the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites these charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than ppg’s historical range excluding 2006 pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year for the past 15 years we anticipate that charges against income in 2010 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range 

  

management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately 70 million in 2010 and to range from 50 million to 70 million annually through 2014 it is possible that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays specifically the level of expected cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to the former chromium manufacturing plant site in new jersey as ppg awaits approval of workplans that have been submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies 

  

impact of inflation 

in 2009 ppg experienced a reduction in our energy and raw material costs following the significant increases in these costs experienced in 2008 and 2007 which was driven by lower global demand as a result of the recession and the delayed impact of lower oil prices this impact was largely offset by reductions in our selling prices the impact of inflation net of price was negative in our commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments and was positive in our three coatings and the optical and specialty materials reportable segments 

  

in 2008 ppg was able to more than offset the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs with increased selling prices in our commodity chemicals reportable segment the increase in our costs due to inflation was more than offset by higher selling prices in our performance coatings and optical and specialty materials reportable segments the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was offset by higher selling prices however in our industrial coatings and glass reportable segments the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not offset by higher selling prices 

  

in 2007 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material costs in our industrial coatings commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments were not offset by higher selling prices higher selling prices did offset the negative impact of inflation in our performance coatings and optical and specialty materials reportable segments 

  

in 2010 we expect the costs in all our businesses to increase due to the negative effects of inflation including the cost of certain raw materials as a result of increases in global demand we will continue our efforts to manage our energy efficiency and our material costs through product reformulation and qualification of additional suppliers particularly those from lower cost regions of the world we expect those efforts combined with increases in our selling prices and manufacturing cost 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

efficiencies will offset the negative impact of inflation in 2010 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

  

cash from operating activities was 1345 million 1437 million and 1063 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in cash from operations in 2009 compared to 2008 of 92 million was due in large part to lower earnings higher pension contributions and higher cash spending on restructuring in 2009 offset by an increase in cash from a reduction in our working capital we used the 2009 cash from operating activities to fund our capital spending pay dividends and repay 646 million of debt during the year and still have over 1 billion of cash on hand at december 31 2009 

  

the change in working capital elements excluding the impact of currency included in cash from operating activities was a source of cash of 377 million during the year ended december 31 2009 accounts receivable as a percentage of fourth quarter sales annualized for 2009 was 211 down from 22 for 2008 days sales outstanding decreased to 65 days in 2009 from 71 days in 2008 inventories as a percentage of fourth quarter sales annualized for 2009 was 124 down from 133 for 2008 inventory turnover was 4 times in 2009 and 2008 

  

total capital spending was 265 million 2056 million and 597 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was 239 million 383 million and 364 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and is expected to be approximately 350 million during 2010 capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to 26 million 1673 million and 233 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 353 million 343 million and 335 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899 and 2009 marked the 38th consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders over time our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately onethird of our earnings per share 

  

we did not have a mandatory contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2009 however due in large part to the negative investment return on pension plan assets in 2008 we made voluntary contributions to these plans in 2009 totaling 360 million in 2008 and 2007 we made voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans of 50 million and 100 million respectively contributions were made to our nonus defined benefit pension plans of 90 million 69 million and 49 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively some of which were required by local funding requirements of the total 2009 contributions of 450 million approximately 120 million was made in the form of ppg stock we expect to make voluntary contributions to our us plans in 2010 of approximately 150 million and we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in 2010 of approximately 90 million 

  

in december of 2008 the company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase 15 million shares of the company’s stock under the terms of the agreement the counterparty purchased the shares in the open market in january of 2009 and held the shares until december of 2009 when the company paid the agreed upon price of 3953 per share and took possession of these shares the total cost of this share repurchase was approximately 59 million 

  

in 2008 the company purchased 01 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 7 million and during 2007 the company repurchased 37 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 274 million 

  

on january 2 2008 ppg completed the acquisition of sigmakalon a worldwide coatings producer based in uithoorn netherlands from global private investment firm bain capital “the seller” the acquired business produces architectural protective and marine and industrial coatings and is a leading coatings supplier in europe and other key markets across the globe with an increasing presence in africa and asia the total transaction value was approximately 32 billion consisting of cash paid to the seller of 1673 million and debt assumed of 1517 million 

  

in order to provide financing for the sigmakalon acquisition in december 2007 ppg and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a three year €650 million revolving credit facility with several banks and financial institutions and societe generale as facility agent for the lenders in addition ppg and a subsidiary entered into two bridge loan agreements one in the amount of €1 billion with multiple lenders and credit suisse as administrative agent for those lenders and the other in the amount of 500 million with credit suisse as the lender 

  

in december 2007 ppg issued 617 million of commercial paper and borrowed 1056 million €717 million under the €1 billion bridge loan agreement the proceeds from these borrowings were deposited into escrow in december 2007 upon closing of the acquisition on january 2 2008 these amounts were released from escrow and paid to the seller also in january 2008 ppg borrowed 1143 million representing the remaining 417 million €283 million available under the €1 billion bridge loan agreement and 726 million €493 million under the €650 million revolving 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

credit facility the proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand of 116 million were used to refinance 1259 million of the 1517 million of sigmakalon debt outstanding on the date of acquisition no amounts were borrowed under the 500 million bridge loan agreement and due to the passage of time and the specific purpose of this agreement ppg can no longer make borrowings under this agreement 

  

on march 18 2008 ppg completed a public offering of 600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 575 notes due 2013 the “2013 notes” 700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 665 notes due 2018 the “2018 notes” and 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 770 notes due 2038 the “2038 notes” and together with the 2013 notes and the 2018 notes the “notes” the notes were offered by the company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement the proceeds of this offering of 1538 million net of discount and issuance costs and additional borrowings of 195 million under the €650 million revolving credit facility were used to repay existing debt including certain shortterm debt and the amounts outstanding under the €1 billion bridge loan no further amounts can be borrowed under the €1 billion bridge loan the discount and issuance costs related to the notes which totaled 12 million will be amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the notes 

  

in july 2008 the company entered into an agreement to divest its automotive oem glass and automotive replacement glass and services businesses “automotive glass and services business” under the agreement ppg received a noncontrolling ownership interest in the new company formed by the buyer the transaction was completed on september 30 2008 the company received cash proceeds of 225 million at closing and two sixyear notes totaling 90 million from this transaction 

  

in the fourth quarter 2008 the company monetized certain cross currency foreign exchange swap contracts which had been designated as hedges of our euro denominated net investment in sigmakalon and replaced them with new swap contracts as a result of these swap monetizations the company received 208 million in cash proceeds see item 7a of this form 10k for further information regarding these instruments 

  

in june 2009 ppg entered into a 400 million three year unsecured term loan we used 116 million of the proceeds from this term loan to retire our 705 notes due 2009 the remainder of the loan proceeds of approximately 284 million were used to retire outstanding amounts under our €650 million revolving credit facility the principal amount of this term loan is due in three years and the interest rate is variable based on a spread over libor 

  

  

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 47 at december 31 2009 and 54 at december 31 2008 the decrease at year end 2009 is primarily due to the reduction of the company’s debt during 2009 

  

we continue to believe that our cash on hand cash from operations and the company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund operating activities capital spending including acquisitions dividend payments debt service amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table 

  

      

the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases natural gas coal and electricity consistent with customary industry practice these amounts also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 6 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

see note 9 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

  

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company has an automatic shelf registration on file with the sec pursuant to which it may issue offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 9 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

  

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 4 “working capital detail” note 14 “income taxes” and note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually see note 15 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

  

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption for 2010 is 590 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a change in the discount rate of 75 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would impact 2010 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 12 million and 9 million respectively 

  

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2009 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 85 we will use the same assumption for 2010 a change in the rate of return of 75 basis points with other assumptions held constant would impact 2010 net periodic pension expense by approximately 18 million 

  

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of december 31 2009 

  

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

  

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

currency 

  

from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the canadian dollar the british pound sterling the polish zloty the brazilian real the south korean won and the australian dollar as a result the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets at december 31 2009 by 173 million compared to december 31 2008 during much of the year the us dollar was stronger against the currencies of many countries in which ppg operates than it was in 2008 which had an unfavorable impact on 2009 pretax earnings of 29 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

  

from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 the us dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling the polish zloty the brazilian real the south korean won and the australian dollar as a result the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar decreased consolidated net assets at december 31 2008 by 499 million compared to december 31 2007 during much of the year the us dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which ppg operates than it was in 2007 which had a favorable impact on 2008 pretax earnings of 45 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

  

during 2007 the us dollar weakened against certain of the currencies in the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the canadian dollar and the brazilian real the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets at december 31 2007 by 260 million compared to december 31 2006 in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2007 pretax earnings of 47 million 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

  

forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include global economic conditions increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets which also depends on economic and political conditions foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

  

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

company’s risk management policies are provided in note 12 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

  

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2009 and 2008 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of december 31 2009 and 2008 were liabilities of 3 million and 17 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 would have been 17 million and 27 million respectively 

  

concurrent with the march 18 2008 completion of the 155 billion public debt offering ppg entered into ten us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 13 billion of which 600 million were to settle on march 15 2013 and 700 million were to settle on march 15 2018 on march 18 2008 ppg paid the counterparties to the contracts a total of 13 billion and received euros which were used to repay most of the €1 billion bridge loan which the company employed to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon during the fourth quarter of 2008 ppg converted 116 billion of these contracts to 208 million of cash and replaced them with new cross currency swap contracts on settlement of the contracts ppg will receive 13 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts the company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired sigmakalon businesses and as a result mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of 308 million and 130 million respectively a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increase the liability by 182 million and 181 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 723 million as of december 31 2009 and 1373 million as of december 31 2008 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 81 million and 118 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of 10 million and 3 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by  3 million and 05 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately 1 million as of december 31 2009 and 3 million as of december 31 2008 further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately  91 million and 118 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

  

the company entered into forward starting swaps in the third quarter of 2009 to effectively lockin a fixed interest rate based on the 10year swap rate to which will be added a corporate spread related to future debt refinancings the notional amount of these swaps totaled 250 million as of december 31 2009 the fair value of these swaps was an asset of 3 million a 10 decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by 10 million 

  

the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31 2009 and 2008 was a liability of 50 million and 85 million respectively these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to higher prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by 14 million and 27 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 12 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” and note 16 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of december 31 2009 and 2008 was an asset of 18 million and a liability of 6 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of 8 million and 6 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success our primary energy cost is natural gas used in our commodity chemicals and glass businesses in 2008 our natural gas costs were volatile and on average increased almost 25 percent in the us compared to 2007 levels the increase can be linked to yearoveryear strong pricing for energy commodities including the run up in the price of crude oil by midyear 

  

during 2008 our average coatings raw material costs increased about 5 percent with differing results by region coatings raw material costs rose 1 percent and 3 percent in 2007 and 2006 respectively many of our coatings raw materials are petroleum based and changes in pricing for these raw materials traditionally lags oil price fluctuations by about six months our costs are also dependent on global supply and demand for these materials escalating crude oil prices and global economic growth rates especially in emerging regions in the first two quarters of 2008 resulted in higher inflation impacts to ppg’s coatings raw materials in the third and most of the fourth quarter of 2008 this inflation was more acute and volatile in north america asia and other emerging regions however rapid second half 2008 oil price declines along with the sudden drop in global industrial demand late in the year resulted in a decline in the price of certain raw materials in these same regions as we were exiting the year 

  

the company’s most significant raw materials are titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses lenses photochromic dye sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass businesses most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company has aggressive sourcing initiatives underway to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest total material costs these initiatives include reformulation of certain of our products using both petroleum derived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy another initiative is to qualify multiple sources of supply including supplies from asia and other lower cost regions of the world 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals that impact or could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards in december 2006 the environment ministers of the european union “eu” member states gave final approval to comprehensive chemical management legislation known as “reach” registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach applies to all chemical substances manufactured or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more annually and will require the registration of approximately 30000 chemical substances with the european chemicals agency the preregistration period for such chemicals ended on december 1 2008 additionally reach requires the registration of these materials entailing the filing of extensive data on their potential risks to human health and the environment registration activities will be phased over an 11year period based on tonnage and level of concern with the first registration deadline set for december 1 2010 in the case of chemicals with a high level of concern the regulation calls for progressive substitution unless no alternative can be found in these cases authorization of the chemicals will be required 

  

ppg has established a dedicated organization to manage reach implementation we have reviewed our product portfolio worked closely with our suppliers to assure their commitment to preregister our key raw materials and completed preregistrations of ppg manufactured or imported raw materials we will continue to work with our suppliers to understand the future availability and viability of the raw materials we use in our production processes 

  

ppg anticipates that some current raw materials and products will be subject to the reach authorization process and believes that ppg will be able to demonstrate adequate risk management for the use and application of the majority of such substances compliance with the reach legislation will result in increased costs due to registration costs product testing and reformulation risk characterization participation in substance information exchange forums and consortia and dossier preparation the reach legislation has prompted a growing number of initiatives in other regions the most notable of which is the “champ” chemical assessment and management program that has been initiated in the us under champ chemicals imported or manufactured in the us above 25000 pounds annually will undergo hazard and risk characterization by the us environmental protection agency “usepa” chemicals identified by 

  

   

the usepa as high risk or of special concern will be subject to further data development andor regulatory control at this time it is not possible to quantify the financial impact of these regulatory initiatives on ppg’s businesses 

  

research and development 

technology innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 468 million 363 million and 330 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these costs totaled approximately 3 of sales in each of these years representing a level of expenditure that is expected to continue in 2009 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes additional process and product research and development work is also undertaken at many of the company’s manufacturing plants as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our costs effectively we operate a laboratory in china have outsourcing arrangements with several laboratories and have been actively pursuing government funding of a small but growing portion of the company’s research efforts because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg received 52 million in 2008  48 million in 2007 and 44 million in 2006 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

  

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

  

nonus operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations and as a result we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 75 of sales and operating income is generated by products sold in the united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and latin america with the acquisition of sigmakalon in january 2008 we have increased our international operations as substantially all of its sales are outside the united states 

  

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2008 was 44900 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

  

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 15 million 16 million and 14 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2009 will be in the range of 1525 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

  

prior to 2007 about 20 of our chloralkali production capacity used mercury cell technology ppg strives to operate these cells in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and these cells are reviewed at least annually by state authorities the usepa has issued new regulations imposing significantly more stringent requirements on mercury emissions these new rules took effect in december 2006 in order to meet the usepa’s new air quality standards a decision was made in july 2005 to replace the existing mercury cell production unit at the lake charles la chloralkali plant with newer membrane cell technology the louisiana department of environmental quality granted the company a one year extension to meet the new requirements on mercury emissions this capital project began in 2005 and was completed in 2007 with the completion of this project in 2007 4 of ppg’s chloralkali production uses mercury cell technology 

  

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 105 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 23 sites on the national priority list the number of sites has increased when compared to the prior year primarily as a result of sites that were assumed as a result of the sigmakalon acquisition while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature 

  

   

and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of december 31 2008 and 2007 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 299 million and 276 million respectively of which 44 million and 57 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2008 2007 and 2006 totaled 15 million 12 million and 207 million respectively cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 24 million 19 million and 22 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as part of the allocation of the sigmakalon purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the reserve for environmental contingencies was increased by 37 million in 2008 the impact of foreign currency translation decreased the liability by 5 million in 2008 environmental remediation of a former chromium manufacturing plant site and associated sites in jersey city nj represented the major part of our 2006 environmental charges and our existing reserves included in the amounts mentioned above were 185 million of 2006 charges against income and 193 million and 195 million in reserves at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively associated with all new jersey chromium sites 

  

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

  

charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites excluding 2006 pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year for the past 15 years we anticipate that charges against income in 2009 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range 

  

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters 

  

there are growing public and governmental concerns related to climate change which have led to efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions these concerns were reflected in the 2005 framework for ghg reduction under the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change the kyoto protocol has been adopted by many countries where ppg operates including the eu and canada though not in the us the eu has implemented a cap and trade approach with a mandatory emissions trading scheme for ghgs in december 2007 delegates to the united nations framework convention on climate change reached agreement on development of a plan for the second phase of kyoto scheduled to start in 2013 this could potentially lead to further reduction requirements a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us however at this time it is uncertain whether the us will set ghg reduction goals under the kyoto protocol or by some other mechanism ppg has joined the usbased climate registry to assist in verification of future ghg reduction achievements in preparation for potential imposition in the us of ghg reduction goals 

  

energy prices and availability of supply continue to be a concern for major energy users since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation we committed under the business roundtable’s climate resolve program to reduce our ghg intensity ghgs produced per million dollars of revenue by 18 between 2002 and 2012 ppg achieved this target in 2006 six years ahead of schedule recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has appointed an energy security and climate change steering group to guide the company’s progress in this area additionally in 2007 ppg announced new corporate targets namely i a reduction in energy intensity by 25 from 2006 to 2016 and ii a 10 absolute reduction in ghg emissions from 2006 to 2011 ppg’s public disclosure on energy security and climate change can be viewed at the carbon disclosure project wwwcdprojectnet

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings glass and chemicals products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business 

  

the current us and worldwide recession and credit crisis could have a continuing negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the demand for many of our products in europe asia and latin america declined significantly as the impact of the recession in the us economy which had impacted demand throughout 2008 spread globally the impact of the recession was felt most noticeably by our businesses serving the automotive original equipment construction and general industrial markets entering 2009 the global economic outlook in terms of gdp and industrial production is for weak conditions to prevail many economists are forecasting that the recession will persist through at least the first half of 2009 continued weakness in the global economy would be expected to result in lower demand for many of our products and increase our exposure to credit risk from customers in the industries most impacted by the weak economy how deep and how long the recession will last is not known 

  

we sell products to global and regional automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers 

global production of automobiles and light trucks declined by 2 in 2008 reflecting declines of 19 in the us and canada and 7 in western europe that were substantially offset by growth in production in eastern europe asia and latin america the industry forecast for 2009 projects a global decline of nearly 10 with declines in production in all regions of the world led by the us and canada where vehicle production is forecast to be down approximately 25 declines in the global production of automobiles and light trucks of this magnitude would adversely impact our sales volume 

  

the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change including the loss of us market share by general motors ford and chrysler further deterioration of market conditions could cause certain of our customers and suppliers to experience liquidity problems potentially resulting in the writeoff of amounts due from these customers and cost impacts of changing suppliers our worldwide sales to general motors ford and chrysler are made under normal credit terms and we expect to collect substantially all of the approximately 45 million due from these customers at december 31 2008 in the first quarter of 2009 however we remain focused on the continual management of this credit risk 

  

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy including natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each onedollar change in our unit price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs in 2008 our natural gas costs were volatile and on average increased almost 25 in the us compared to 2007 levels yearoveryear coatings raw material costs rose by 150 million in 2008 following a rise of 40 million in 2007 this inflation which was partially linked to increased oil prices occurred in all regions of the world with the most significant impact in the us the impact was most significant in the automotive industrial architectural coatings–americas and asia pacific and automotive refinish businesses 

  

we also import raw materials particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world in most cases those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and therefore our margins are at risk of being lowered if those foreign currencies strengthen against the local currencies of our manufacturing facilities 

  

additionally certain raw materials are critical to our production processes these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses lenses photochromic dye sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses we have made and plan to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future however an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products 

  

   

we experience substantial competition from certain lowcost regions 

growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world including asia eastern europe and latin america where energy and labor costs are lower than those in the us could result in lower selling prices or reduced demand for some of our glass and fiber glass products 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

excluding 2006 pretax charges against income for environmental remediation ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year over the past 15 years in 2006 those charges totaled 207 million we have accrued 299 million for estimated remediation costs that are probable at december 31 2008 our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation if necessary of such environmental contingencies and the potential for technological and regulatory developments as such in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 300 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount 

  

for over 30 years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

  

our products are subject to existing and evolving regulations 

regulations concerning the composition and use of chemical products continue to evolve developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations andor our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets 

  

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

because we are a global company our results are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 75 of sales and operating income in 2008 was generated by products sold in the united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and latin america 

  

as a producer of chemicals we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature 

we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner however these materials if mishandled or released into the environment could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us in addition evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs 

  

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages natural disasters and severe weather events fires or war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and to deliver products to customers

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

divestiture of automotive glass and services business 

during the third quarter of 2007 the company entered into an agreement to sell its automotive glass and services business to platinum equity “platinum” for approximately 500 million accordingly the assets and liabilities of this business were classified as held for sale and the results of operations and cash flows of this business were classified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2007 ppg was notified that affiliates of platinum had filed suit in the supreme court of the state 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

of new york county of new york alleging that platinum was not obligated to consummate the agreement platinum also terminated the agreement ppg has sued platinum and certain of its affiliates for damages including the 25 million breakup fee stipulated by the terms of the agreement based on various alleged actions of the platinum parties while the transaction with platinum was terminated ppg management remained committed to a sale of the automotive glass and services business and continued to classify its assets and liabilities as held for sale and report its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations through the first quarter of 2008 

  

in july 2008 ppg entered into an agreement with affiliates of kohlberg  company llc under which ppg would divest the automotive glass and services business to a new company formed by affiliates of kohlberg under the agreement ppg would receive a minority interest in the new company and as such the accounting requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” for classifying the business as assets held for sale and reporting its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations had no longer been met the assets and liabilities of the business have been classified as held for use in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2007 and the results of operations and cash flows of the business through september 30 2008 have been classified as continuing operations in the glass reportable segment in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under item 8 of this form 10k for the three years ended december 31 2008 

  

in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of the reclassification of the automotive glass and services business to continuing operations ppg recorded a onetime noncash charge of 17 million 11 million aftertax to reflect a catchup of depreciation expense which was suspended when the business was classified as a discontinued operation additionally in the second quarter of 2008 ppg recorded a charge of 19 million 12 million aftertax for special termination benefits and a pension curtailment loss relating to the impact of benefit changes including accelerated vesting negotiated as part of the sale 

  

the transaction with affiliates of kohlberg was completed on september 30 2008 with ppg receiving total proceeds of 315 million including 225 million in cash and two 6year notes totaling 90 million 60 million at 85 interest and 30 million at 10 interest both notes which may be prepaid at any time without penalty are senior to the equity of the new company in addition ppg has received a minority interest of approximately 40 percent in the new company pittsburgh glass works llc this transaction resulted in a third quarter 2008 gain of 15 million pretax net of transaction costs and is included in “other income” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2008 under item 8 the aftertax gain on the transaction was 3 million reflective of tax expense of 12 million tax expense on the gain includes the tax cost of repatriating certain transaction proceeds from canada to the us and the impact of certain permanent booktax differences which resulted in a larger taxable gain ppg will account for its interest in pittsburgh glass works llc under the equity method of accounting from october 1 2008 onward ppg has retained certain liabilities for pension and postemployment benefits earned for service up to september 30 2008 

  

divestiture of fine chemicals business 

  

in the third quarter of 2007 ppg entered into an agreement to sell its fine chemicals business to zach system spa a subsidiary of zambon company spa for approximately 65 million the sale of this business was completed in november 2007 the results of operations and cash flows of this business which had previously been included in the optical and specialty materials reportable segment have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under item 8 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 ppg recorded a pretax loss on sale of the fine chemicals business of 25 million 19 million aftertax in 2007 

  

performance in 2008 compared with 2007 

  

performance overview 

our sales increased 30 to 158 billion in 2008 compared to 122 billion in 2007 sales increased 28 due to the impact of acquisitions 4 due to increased selling prices and 2 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation these sales increases were offset by a 2 decline due to lower sales volumes and by a 2 decline related to the automotive glass and services business divestiture 

  

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by 2327 million in 2008 to 10155 million compared to 7828 million in 2007 this increase corresponds with the increase in sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 641 in both 2008 and 2007 cost of sales in 2008 includes 94 million for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory related to the sigmakalon acquisition 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 1122 million in 2008 due principally to the impact of the acquisition of sigmakalon selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 217 for 2008 compared to 189 for 2007 the increase 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due largely to the addition of sigmakalon and reflects the distribution nature of these businesses which requires higher selling distribution advertising and regional management costs to serve their broad customer profile selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in the architectural coatings  emea reportable segment are in line with ppg’s other architectural coatings businesses other factors causing the increase in these expenses were higher levels of cost to support growth in our coatings and optical businesses higher bad debt expense associated with the impact of the weakening economy on our customers a second quarter charge of 19 million for special termination benefits and foreign currency translation 

  

depreciation expense increased by 83 million due primarily to the acquisition of sigmakalon research and development costs increased by 103 million and amortization increased by 77 million compared to 2007 these increases were primarily due to the acquisition of sigmakalon interest expense increased by 161 million in 2008 due to debt incurred to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon 

  

during the third quarter of 2008 the company finalized a restructuring plan that is part of implementing ppg’s global transformation strategy and the integration of its acquisition of sigmakalon the company recorded a charge of 163 million for the cost of this restructuring 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2008 was 313 compared to 291 in 2007 the 2008 rate includes a tax benefit of 14 million related to the settlement with the internal revenue service of our us tax returns for tax years 2004 2005 and 2006 the 2008 rate also includes a total net tax benefit of 265 on costs related to the acquisition of sigmakalon the charges for the catchup of depreciation expense and the impact of benefit changes related to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business the business restructuring charge the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement as discussed in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k and the gain on divestiture of the automotive glass and services business the tax rate was 313 on the remaining pretax earnings in 2008 

  

the rate in 2007 includes the benefit of 15 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against the benefit of a tax net operating loss carryforward the benefit associated with an enacted reduction in the canadian federal corporate income tax rate and a tax benefit of 39 on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement the tax rate was 305 on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 was 252 this rate includes a tax benefit of 24 on the loss on the sale of the fine chemicals business the tax rate was 365 on the remaining pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 

  

net income and earnings per share – assuming dilution for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below 

  

   

         

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

results of reportable business segments 

  

   

performance coatings sales increased 905 million or 24 in 2008 sales increased 21 due to acquisitions largely due to the impact of the sigmakalon protective and marine coatings business sales also grew by 3 due to higher selling prices and 2 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation sales volumes declined 2 as reduced volumes in architectural coatings – americas and asia pacific and automotive refinish were not fully offset by improved volumes in the aerospace and protective and marine businesses volume growth in the aerospace businesses occurred throughout the world while the volume growth in protective and marine coatings occurred primarily in asia segment income increased 19 million in 2008 factors increasing segment income were the positive impact of acquisitions lower overhead costs and the positive impact of foreign currency translation the benefit of higher selling prices more than offset the negative impact of inflation including higher raw materials and benefit costs segment income was reduced by the impact of the lower sales volumes in architectural coatings and automotive refinish which more than offset the benefit of volume gains in the aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses 

  

industrial coatings sales increased 353 million or 10 in 2008 sales increased 11 due to acquisitions including the impact of the sigmakalon industrial coatings business sales also grew 3 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and 1 from higher selling prices sales volumes declined 5 as reduced volumes were experienced in all three businesses reflecting the substantial declines in global demand volume declines in the automotive and industrial businesses were primarily in the us and canada additional volume declines in the european and asian regions were experienced by the industrial coatings business in packaging coatings volume declines in europe were only partially offset by gains in asia and north america segment income declined 158 million in 2008 due to the lower volumes and inflation including higher raw material and freight costs the impact of which was only partially mitigated by the increased selling prices segment income also declined due to higher selling and distribution costs including higher bad debt expense factors increasing segment income were the earnings of acquired businesses the positive impact of foreign currency translation and lower manufacturing costs 

  

architectural coatings  emea sales for the year were 2249 million this business was acquired in the sigmakalon acquisition segment income was 141 million which included amortization expense of 63 million related to acquired intangible assets and depreciation expense of 58 million 

  

optical and specialty materials sales increased 105 million or 10 in 2008 sales increased 5 due to higher volumes in our optical products business resulting from the launch of transitions optical’s next generation lens product 3 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and 2 due to increased selling prices segment income increased 9 million in 2008 the increase in segment income was the result of increased sales volumes and the favorable impact of currency partially offset by increased selling and marketing costs in the optical products business related to the transitions optical product launch mentioned above increased selling prices only partially offset higher raw material costs primarily in our silicas business 

  

commodity chemicals sales increased 298 million or 19 in 2008 sales increased 18 due to higher selling prices and 1 due to improved sales volumes segment income increased 97 million in 2008 segment income increased in large part due to higher selling prices which more than offset the negative impact of inflation primarily higher raw material and energy costs segment income also improved due to lower manufacturing costs while lower margin mix and equity earnings reduced segment income 

  

glass sales decreased 281 million or 13 in 2008 sales decreased 11 due to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business in september 2008 and 4 due to lower sales volumes sales increased 2 due to higher selling prices segment income decreased 68 million in 2008 segment income decreased due to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business lower volumes the negative impact of inflation and lower equity earnings from our asian fiber glass joint ventures factors increasing segment income were lower manufacturing costs higher selling prices and stronger foreign currency 

  

outlook 

overall global economic activity was volatile in 2008 with an overall downward trend the north american economy continued a slowing trend which began during the second half of 2006 and continued all of 2007 the impact of the weakening us economy was particularly 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

evident in lower automotive production housing starts and consumer confidence many economies in other regions were stable early in 2008 but then began to slow during the year with nearly all global economies slowing rapidly in the fourth quarter the significance of access to credit and overall liquidity concerns increased as the year progressed triggering intervention by many governments to provide interim financial aid to the global banking system and to lower interest rates and implement other measures intended to stimulate economic activity industrial endmarkets experienced rapid declines in the fourth quarter as global demand dropped reflecting a deepening us recession and the spread of the banking crisis and recessionary conditions to many european asian and latin american economies 

  

early in 2008 global inflation intensified as oil prices accelerated to alltime highs these inflationary trends continued well into the third quarter driving up costs of other energy sources and many of the products that are dependent upon energy as a feedstock then in recognition of the global economic slowing prices of energy and many related commodities declined in the latter part of the year 

  

the north american economy continued to slow during the year residential construction continued to decline while rising unemployment high levels of mortgage foreclosures and real estate pricing declines were among the primary causal factors of the ongoing banking crisis industrial output sagged with the us automotive oem market declining the most of any of the major industrial markets by yearend declines in many industrial endmarkets exceeded 10 percent with several declining 2030 percent the declining economic environment resulted in a continued upward shift of the us unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence to alltime lows 

  

the european economy was more stable early in the year with softness beginning to appear in a few countries such as spain italy and the united kingdom most of the remaining parts of western europe began to experience similar declines to the us later in the year eastern european growth once again outpaced growth in western europe with most countries continuing to grow throughout the year albeit at declining rates however several countries including hungary poland and russia began to experience economic decline stemming from either the spread of the banking crisis or the drop in commodity pricing 

  

the asian economies continued to post very high growth rates well into the year but the impact of the decline in the us and european economies eventually led to declines in the asian growth rates late in the year overall china gdp grew to the point that china now represents the third largest economy globally but even this growth rate fell below 10 percent for the first time in over five years 

  

entering 2009 the overall economic outlook is uncertain and extremely bearish many economists believe the us will experience its worst recession in at least 50 years with other major regional economies possibly following suit as a result we expect the 2008 inflationary pressures on our input cost to at least in part reverse the company is anticipating a generally stronger us dollar in 2009 resulting in negative sales and earnings impacts relating to translation of the sales and earnings from our foreign affiliates compared to 2008 

  

pension and postretirement benefit costs will increase in 2009 due largely to the significant declines in plan assets due to 2008 investment performance our pension and postretirement benefit costs totaled 258 million in 2008 including charges of 34 million related to plan changes stemming from the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business and our 2008 restructuring actions based on our current estimates we expect our ongoing pension and other postretirement benefits costs to increase by approximately 100125 million in 2009 

  

our natural gas costs in 2008 were volatile and on average increased by almost 25 percent in the us as compared to 2007 changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each one dollar change in our price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs our 2008 natural gas costs averaged over 900 per mmbtu for the year while our 2007 costs averaged about 725 while it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we use a variety of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging we currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2009 will be lower than the first quarter of 2008 we currently have about 50 of our first quarter 2009 us natural gas purchases hedged at a price of about 850 and approximately 50 of our 2009 us annual requirements hedged at about 800 the current spot price for natural gas is about 500 

  

in the past year we experienced increases in the prices we pay for raw materials used in many of our businesses particularly in our coatings businesses the increases have resulted from global industrial expansion supplydemand imbalance and increases in supplier feedstock costs we have and plan to continue to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate and global supply sources for our raw materials reformulating our products 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

improving our production processes and raising our selling prices yearoveryear coatings raw material costs rose by about 150 million in 2008 or about a 5 percent increase up notably from 2007 which increased by about 40 million or 1 percent our current forecast for the early portion of 2009 is for the cost of certain raw materials to decline resulting from the delayed impact of lower oil prices and lower global demand for the materials we purchase we also expect a negative impact on our margins in the united kingdom eastern europe and latin america where raw materials are purchased in currencies that are expected to be stronger than the local currencies about 30 of our coatings sales in europe are made outside the eurozone given the dynamic supplydemand energy cost and currency environment it is not feasible to project full year raw material pricing but the main drivers will continue to be overall economic conditions and resulting supply and demand factors 

  

the combination of a tight supply position for caustic and high energy costs resulted in chloralkali pricing that ended 2008 at an alltime record high and pricing for the fourth quarter that was up 20 over the prior year chloralkali demand was strong at the beginning of the fourth quarter following the adverse impact of third quarter hurricanes on industrial activity in the us gulf coast demand softened in november and december and we are anticipating that early 2009 demand levels will be less than in the fourth quarter 

  

we completed significant portfolio changes in 2008 that have been crucial in the transformation of the company we completed the acquisition of sigmakalon the total transaction value was approximately 32 billion consisting of cash paid of 1673 million and debt assumed of 1517 million we also completed a few other targeted acquisitions at a cost totaling nearly 140 million as in past years these acquisitions are intended to strengthen our coatings businesses by extending their geographic breadth andor product offering the sales for businesses held for less than one year added approximately 34 billion to ppg’s 2008 sales with midsingle digit operating margins excluding certain onetime acquisition related costs and including amortization expense stemming from the acquisitions which amortization totaled 79 million interim financing from the sigmakalon acquisition was replaced with permanent financing in march 2008 as ppg placed term debt with five ten and thirty year maturities at a cost of 575 665 and 770 respectively which we believe is favorable to the cost of placing that debt today 

  

also in 2008 we completed the divestiture of a majority interest in the automotive glass and services business we retained about a 40 percent interest in the business and will account for this interest using the equity method of accounting the weak economic conditions that are adversely impacting our continuing businesses that serve the automotive oem market are also significantly impacting this divested business 

  

the company announced restructuring actions in the third quarter of 2008 focused on reducing its cost structure including actions associated with achieving the synergies from the integration of the acquired sigmakalon business and in reflection of the lower demand levels we are considering additional costreduction actions which may result in additional restructuring charges and related cost savings in 2009 

  

global economic conditions entering 2009 are extremely challenging due to continued lack of industrial demand and global credit issues the transformation of the company including the 2008 portfolio changes has enhanced our geographic sales mix as now only about 45 percent of sales are derived in the us and canada and emerging regions account for nearly 25 percent of sales additionally we have broadened our endmarkets served resulting in lower exposure to any individual endmarket entering the year we have 1 billion of cash on hand following record cash generation in 2008 we anticipate that our increased diversification and our cash and existing borrowing capacity will provide the company with the liquidity it needs to finance operations and reward shareholders in 2009 even in the face of today’s weakened global economy and the possibility that the recovery does not begin until 2010

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

performance in 2007 compared with 2006 

  

performance overview 

our sales increased 12 to 122 billion in 2007 compared to 109 billion in 2006 sales increased 6 due to the impact of acquisitions 3 due to increased volumes and 3 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 641 compared to 636 in 2006 due to the adverse impact of inflation net of selling price changes selling general and administrative expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 189 compared to 181 in 2006 these costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to growth including increased advertising costs and the impact of inflation 

  

business restructuring expense decreased 37 million in 2007 in 2006 the company finalized plans for certain actions to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities and recorded a charge of 37 million 

  

other charges decreased 195 million in 2007 the reduction was primarily due to a reduction in environmental expenses which were 195 million lower in 2007 as compared to 2006 

  

other earnings increased 18 million in 2007 due to higher royalty income higher interest income and gains from asset sales 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007 was 291 compared to 261 in 2006 the rate in 2007 included the benefit of 15 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against the benefit of a tax net operating loss carryforward the benefit associated with an enacted reduction in the canadian federal corporate income tax rate and a tax benefit of 39 on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement the tax rate was 305 on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007 the effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included the benefit of a tax refund from canada resulting from the favorable resolution of a tax dispute dating back to 1998 and a tax benefit related to the settlement with the internal revenue service of our tax returns for the years 20012003 in the aggregate these benefits reduced 2006 income tax expense by 39 million the 2006 effective tax rate also included a tax benefit of 36 on the charge for business restructuring and a tax benefit of 39 on the third quarter environmental remediation charge for sites in new jersey and louisiana on the charges for legal settlements and on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement income tax expense of 39 was recognized on certain insurance recoveries and income tax expense of 294 was recognized on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2006 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 was 252 compared to 39 in 2006 the rate in 2007 included a tax benefit of 24 on the loss on the sale of the fine chemicals business the tax rate was 365 on the remaining pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 

  

net income and earnings per share – assuming dilution for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below 

  

  

   

       

results of reportable business segments 

  

   

performance coatings sales increased 723 million or 23 in 2007 sales increased 15 due to sales from acquisitions in all performance coatings businesses 4 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

and 3 due to improved sales volumes in our aerospace and automotive refinish businesses which more than offset slightly lower volumes in architectural coatings the volume growth in the aerospace and refinish businesses occurred throughout the world while the volume decline in architectural coatings was in north america sales also increased 1 due to higher selling prices segment income increased 49 million to a total of 563 million in 2007 factors increasing segment income were improved sales volumes earnings from acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation additionally the benefit of higher selling prices more than offset the impact of inflation segment income decreased due to higher overhead costs to support growth initiatives in this segment 

  

industrial coatings sales increased 410 million or 13 in 2007 sales increased 6 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation 4 due to acquisitions in our automotive and industrial coatings businesses and 3 from improved sales volumes as volume increases in automotive coatings and packaging coatings more than offset declines in the volume of the industrial coatings business in the us and canada volume growth in the automotive coatings business occurred in all regions of the world while the volume growth in packaging coatings was experienced mainly in asia and europe the decline in industrial coatings’ north american volumes overshadowed solid growth for this business in europe asia and latin america segment income increased 21 million in 2007 due to improved sales volumes the impact of acquisitions lower manufacturing costs and the positive impact of foreign currency translation factors decreasing segment income were inflation including higher raw material costs which more than offset a slight improvement in selling prices and increased overhead costs to support growth initiatives 

  

optical and specialty materials sales increased 125 million or 14 in 2007 sales increased 8 due to higher volumes primarily in the optical products business 4 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation 1 as the result of sales from acquisitions in the optical products business and 1 due to higher selling prices segment income increased 18 million in 2007 the increase in segment income was primarily the result of the increased sales volumes partially offset by higher advertising expense related to optical products volume growth initiatives in all regions and to the impending launch of transitions optical’s next generation lens product in the first quarter of 2008 

  

commodity chemicals sales increased 56 million or 4 in 2007 sales increased 9 due to higher sales volumes of caustic and derivatives which was partially offset by a 5 decrease in selling prices in part due to lower natural gas input costs segment income decreased 42 million in 2007 segment income was lower in large part due to lower selling prices higher manufacturing costs including maintenance costs and higher raw material costs segment income also decreased as a result of the absence of an insurance recovery received in 2006 for damage caused by hurricane rita in 2005 the benefit of lower energy and environmental costs and improved sales volumes were factors that increased segment income in 2007 

  

glass sales decreased by 32 million or 1 in 2007 sales decreased 1 due to lower sales volumes in our automotive glass and services business and 1 due to the negative impact of lower selling prices primarily in our performance glazings business pricing in the performance glazings business includes a surcharge related to the cost of energy lagged by one quarter the surcharge in 2006 exceeded the 2007 surcharge due to higher energy costs during the comparable periods sales increased by 1 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation segment income decreased 10 million in 2007 segment income decreased due to the negative impact of inflation and lower pricing including the lower energy surcharge in performance glazings these factors were only partially offset by the benefit from lower manufacturing and selling costs 

  

see note 24 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the company’s operating segments and reportable business segments 

  

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement and a description of the antitrust suits against ppg related to the flat glass and automotive refinish industries as discussed in item 3 and note 15 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 15 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time as of december 31 2008 and 2007 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 299 million and 276 million respectively of which 44 million and 57 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2008 2007 and 2006 totaled 15 million 12 million and 207 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the consolidated statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 24 million 19 million and 22 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as part of the allocation of the sigmakalon purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the reserve for environmental contingencies was increased by 37 million in 2008 the impact of foreign currency translation decreased the liability by 5 million in 2008 

  

in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 300 million which range is unchanged since december 31 2007 such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and at the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites excluding 2006 pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year for the past 15 years we anticipate that charges against income in 2009 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range 

  

management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately 50 million in 2009 and to range from 45 million to 75 million annually through 2013 it is possible that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays specifically the level of expected cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to the former chromium manufacturing plant site in new jersey as ppg awaits approval of workplans that have been submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies 

  

impact of inflation 

in 2008 ppg was able to more than offset the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs with increased selling prices in our commodity chemicals reportable segment the increase in our costs due to inflation was more than offset by higher selling prices in our performance coatings and optical and specialty materials reportable segments the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was offset by higher selling prices however in our industrial coatings and glass reportable segments the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not offset by higher selling prices 

  

in 2007 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material costs in our industrial coatings commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments were not offset by higher selling prices higher selling prices did offset the negative impact of inflation in our performance coatings and optical and specialty materials reportable segments 

  

in 2006 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material costs in our coatings businesses was offset by higher selling prices in our industrial coatings performance coatings and commodity chemicals reportable segments and by reduced manufacturing costs in our glass and optical and specialty materials reportable segments 

  

in 2009 we expect that the combined impact of productivity improvements lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices will offset any negative impact of inflation on raw materials energy and other costs we expect erosion in the cost of certain raw materials in some regions of the world in the beginning of 2009 resulting from the delayed impact of lower oil prices and lower global demand for these raw materials however our forecast for raw material inflation remains uncertain for the full year 2009 given the current economic uncertainty and the volatility in commodity and raw material costs we experienced in 2008 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

  

cash from operating activities was 1358 million 996 million and 1115 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

respectively the increase in cash from operations in 2008 compared to 2007 of 362 million was due in large part to an increase in earnings after adjustment for noncash charges for amortization depreciation sigmakalon acquired inventory stepup and inprocess research and development costs and business restructuring and to less growth in working capital the major factors contributing to these higher yearoveryear earnings were the earnings from the acquired sigmakalon business and higher commodity chemicals earnings our strong 2008 performance in terms of cash from operating activities has enabled us to repay 681 million of debt during the year and still have over 1 billion of cash on hand at december 31 2008 our debt reduction activity has lowered our us commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2008 to 222 million the credit crisis in the us drove up our cost of borrowing in the commercial paper market late in 2008 by about 300 basis points compared to our cost earlier in 2008 shortened the term of our commercial paper borrowings and effectively reduced the amount of credit available to us in this market from time to time however our strong cash position and other available credit facilities were sufficient to fund the shortfall we experienced in terms of commercial paper availability in 2008 in the early part of 2009 our cost of borrowing in the commercial paper market has declined by about 400 basis points and the amount of credit available to us in this market has returned to a more normal level 

  

total current assets less total current liabilities net working capital decreased 171 million to 2138 million at december 31 2008 from 2309 million at december 31 2007 the decrease in net working capital is principally related to the change in net shortterm borrowings and the growth in accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset with increases in accounts receivable and inventory driven by acquisitions and an increase in cash due to our cash flow focus in the fourth quarter of 2008 accounts receivable as a percent of annual sales for 2008 decreased to 177 percent from 206 percent in 2007 days sales outstanding decreased to 65 days in 2008 from 75 days in 2007 inventories as a percent of annual sales decreased to 107 percent from 125 percent in 2007 inventory turnover was 5 times in 2008 and 2007 

  

total capital spending was 2056 million 597 million and 771 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was 383 million 364 million and 369 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and is expected to be approximately 200 million during 2009 capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to 1673 million 233 million and 402 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

on january 2 2008 ppg completed the acquisition of sigmakalon a worldwide coatings producer based in uithoorn netherlands from global private investment firm bain capital “the seller” sigmakalon produces architectural protective and marine and industrial coatings and is a leading coatings supplier in europe and other key markets across the globe with an increasing presence in africa and asia the total transaction value was approximately 32 billion consisting of cash paid to the seller of 1673 million and debt assumed of 1517 million 

  

in order to provide financing for the sigmakalon acquisition in december 2007 ppg and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a three year €650 million revolving credit facility with several banks and financial institutions and societe generale as facility agent for the lenders the facility has an annual fee of 7 basis points in addition ppg and a subsidiary entered into two bridge loan agreements one in the amount of €1 billion with multiple lenders and credit suisse as administrative agent for those lenders and the other in the amount of 500 million with credit suisse as the lender 

  

in december 2007 ppg issued 617 million of commercial paper and borrowed 1056 million €717 million under the €1 billion bridge loan agreement the proceeds from these borrowings were deposited into escrow in december 2007 upon closing of the acquisition on january 2 2008 these amounts were released from escrow and paid to the seller also in january 2008 ppg borrowed 1143 million representing the remaining 417 million €283 million available under the €1 billion bridge loan agreement and 726 million €493 million under the €650 million revolving credit facility the proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand of 116 million were used to refinance 1259 million of the 1517 million of sigmakalon debt outstanding on the date of acquisition no amounts were borrowed under the 500 million bridge loan agreement and due to the passage of time and the specific purpose of this agreement ppg can no longer make borrowings under this agreement 

  

on march 18 2008 ppg completed a public offering of 600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 575 notes due 2013 the “2013 notes” 700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 665 notes due 2018 the “2018 notes” and 250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 770 notes due 2038 the “2038 notes” and together with the 2013 notes and the 2018 notes the “notes” the notes were offered by the company pursuant to its existing shelf registration the proceeds of this offering of 1538 million net of discount and issuance costs and additional borrowings of 195 million under the €650 million revolving credit 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

facility were used to repay existing debt including certain shortterm debt and the amounts outstanding under the €1 billion bridge loan no further amounts can be borrowed under the €1 billion bridge loan the discount and issuance costs related to the notes which totaled 12 million will be amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the notes 

  

in the fourth quarter 2008 the company monetized certain cross currency foreign exchange swap contracts which had been designated as hedges of our euro denominated net investment in sigmakalon and replaced them with new swap contracts as a result of these swap monetizations the company received 208 million in cash proceeds see item 7a of this form 10k for further information regarding these instruments 

  

in july 2008 the company entered into an agreement to divest its automotive oem glass and automotive replacement glass and services businesses “automotive glass and services business” under the agreement ppg received a minority ownership interest in the new company formed by the buyer the transaction was completed on september 30 2008 the company received proceeds of 225 million from this transaction 

  

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 343 million 335 million and 316 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899 and 2008 marked the 37th consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders over time our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately onethird of our earnings per share 

  

during 2008 the company repurchased 01 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 7 million under a previously authorized share repurchase program in 2007 the company purchased 37 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 274 million and during 2006 the company repurchased 23 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 153 million 

  

on august 17 2006 the pension protection act of 2006 the “ppa” was signed into law changing the funding requirements for our us defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008 under the requirements of ppa we did not have a mandatory contribution to these plans in 2008 however we made a voluntary contribution of 50 million to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2008 we do not currently expect to have a mandatory contribution to these plans in 2009 however due in large part to the negative investment return on pension plan assets in 2008 we made a voluntary contribution in the amount of 160 million to these plans in january 2009 and we may make additional voluntary contributions to these plans in 2009 in an amount up to 140 million in both 2007 and 2006 we made voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans of 100 million contributions were made to our nonus defined benefit pension plans of 69 million 49 million and 24 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively some of which were required by local funding requirements we expect to make contributions to our nonus plans in 2009 of approximately 60 million all of which are mandatory 

  

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 54 at december 31 2008 and 42 at december 31 2007 the increase in 2008 is primarily due to the additional debt borrowed to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon combined with a reduction in equity driven by currency and pension adjustments to other comprehensive income loss 

  

we continue to believe that our cash on hand cash from operations and the company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund operating activities capital spending including acquisitions dividend payments debt service amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement share repurchases contributions to pension plans and ppg’s significant contractual obligations these significant contractual obligations along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table 

  

      

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases natural gas coal and electricity consistent with customary industry practice these amounts also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 6 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

see note 9 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

  

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company has an automatic shelf registration on file with the sec pursuant to which it may issue offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 9 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

  

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 4 “working capital detail” note 13 “income taxes” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually see note 14 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

  

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption for 2009 is 615 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would increase 2009 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 9 million and 5 million respectively 

  

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2008 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 85 we will use the same assumption for 2009 a reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points with other assumptions held constant would increase 2009 net periodic pension expense by approximately 10 million 

  

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of december 31 2008 

  

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

currency 

  

from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 the us dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling the polish zloty the brazilian real the south korean won and the australian dollar as a result the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar decreased consolidated net assets at december 31 2008 by 499 million compared to december 31 2007 during much of the year the us dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which ppg operates than it was in 2007 which had a favorable impact on 2008 pretax earnings of 45 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into us dollars 

  

during 2007 the us dollar weakened against certain of the currencies in the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the canadian dollar and the brazilian real the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets at december 31 2007 by 260 million compared to december 31 2006 in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2007 pretax earnings of 47 million 

  

during 2006 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling and the australian dollar the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by 179 million for the year ended december 31 2006 in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2006 pretax earnings of 9 million 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

  

forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets which also depends on economic and political conditions foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

  

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 11 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

  

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2008 and 2007 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of december 31 2008 and 2007 were liabilities of 17 million and assets of 04 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 would have been 27 million and 03 million respectively 

  

concurrent with the march 18 2008 completion of the 155 billion public debt offering ppg entered into ten us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of 13 billion of which 600 million were to settle on march 15 2013 and 700 million were to settle on march 15 2018 on march 18 2008 ppg paid the counterparties to the contracts a total of 13 billion and received euros which were used to repay most of the €1 billion bridge loan which the company employed to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon during the fourth quarter of 2008 ppg converted 116 billion of these contracts to 208 million of cash and replaced them with new cross currency swap contracts on settlement of the contracts ppg will receive 13 billion us dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts of which 600 million will settle on march 15 2013 and 700 million will settle on march 15 2018 the company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in sigmakalon and as a result mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as of december 31 2008 the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of 130 million a 10 increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by 181 million at december 31 2008 

  

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt outstanding of 1373 million as of december 31 2008 and 1636 million as of december 31 2007 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 118 million and 203 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of 3 million and 6 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by  05 million and 8 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately 3 million as of december 31 2008 and 10 million as of december 31 2007 further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately  118 million and 48 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

  

the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31 2008 and 2007 was a liability of 85 million and 8 million respectively these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to higher prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by 27 million and 26 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 11 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of december 31 2008 and 2007 was a liability of 6 million and an asset of  18 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument and increased the liability by 6 million at december 31 2008 and reduced the asset by 6 million at december 31 2007

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success our primary energy cost is natural gas used in our glass and commodity chemicals businesses in 2007 natural gas costs declined slightly in the us compared to 2006 levels the decline can be linked to a second consecutive year of relatively low hurricane activity impacting upon natural gas production in the gulf of mexico and record high natural gas inventory levels in the fourth quarters of 2007 and 2006 in 2007 our coatings raw material costs increased by approximately 1 following an approximate 3 rise in 2006 the combination of continued strong global demand particularly in asia and the rising cost of crude oil resulted in upward pressure on material prices as well as transportation costs in addition the growth of global industrial production particularly in china and a slowing in the rate at which our suppliers have added production capacity in north america have resulted not only in upward pressure on price but also have increased the importance of managing our supply chain 

  

the company’s most significant raw materials are titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses lenses photochromic dye sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass businesses most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible the company has aggressive sourcing initiatives underway to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest total material costs these initiatives include reformulation of certain of our products using both petroleum derived and biobased materials as part of a product renewal strategy another initiative is to qualify multiple sources of supply including supplies from asia and other lower cost regions of the world 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals that impact or could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards in december 2006 the environment ministers of the european union “eu” member states gave final approval to comprehensive chemical 

  

   

management legislation known as “reach” registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach will apply to all chemical substances manufactured or imported into the eu in quantities of one metric ton or more annually and will require the registration of approximately 30000 chemical substances with the european chemicals agency the preregistration deadline for such chemicals is december 1 2008 subsequently reach will require the registration and in some cases authorization of these chemicals over an 11year period with the first registration deadline set for december 1 2010 

  

ppg is currently reviewing the implementation guidance being developed by the european chemicals agency activities underway include establishing a dedicated organization within ppg to manage our implementation of reach reviewing our raw materials to identify substances potentially affected by reach working with our suppliers to understand the future availability and viability of the raw materials we use in our production process and creating a reach steering committee consisting of highlevel stakeholders to guide review and approve overall company activities 

  

ppg anticipates that some current raw materials and products may be subject to the reach authorization process and believes that ppg will be able to demonstrate adequate risk management for the use and application of the majority of such substances ppg anticipates that compliance with the reach legislation will increase costs due to registration costs product testing and reformulation risk characterization and report preparation however at this time it is not possible to quantify the financial impact on ppg’s businesses 

  

research and development 

technologic innovation has been a hallmark of ppg’s success throughout its history research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities were 354 million 321 million and 310 million during 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively these costs totaled over 3 of sales in each of these years representing a level of expenditure that is expected to continue in 2008 ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development involving new and improved products and processes additional process and product research and development work is also undertaken at many of the company’s manufacturing plants as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our costs effectively we have a laboratory in china and an outsourcing arrangement with a laboratory in the ukraine and have been actively pursuing government funding of a small but growing portion of the company’s research efforts because of the company’s broad array of products and customers ppg is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg received 48 million in 2007  43 million in 2006 and 35 million in 2005 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

  

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

  

nonus operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations and as a result we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 80 of sales and operating income is generated by products sold in the united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and latin america with the acquisition of sigmakalon in january 2008 we have increased our international operations as substantially all of its sales are outside the united states 

  

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2007 was 34900 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on the ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

  

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 16 million 14 million and 18 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2008 will approximate 31 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

  

prior to 2007 about 20 of our chloralkali production capacity used mercury cell technology ppg strives to operate these cells in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and these cells are reviewed at least 

  

   

annually by state authorities the us environmental protection agency “usepa” has issued new regulations imposing significantly more stringent requirements on mercury emissions these new rules took effect in december 2006 in order to meet the usepa’s new air quality standards a decision was made in july 2005 to replace the existing mercury cell production unit at the lake charles la chloralkali plant with newer membrane cell technology the louisiana department of environmental quality granted the company a one year extension to meet the new requirements on mercury emissions this capital project began in 2005 and was completed in 2007 with the completion of this project 4 of ppg’s chloralkali production uses mercury cell technology 

  

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 94 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 22 sites on the national priority list the number of sites is comparable with the prior year while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of december 31 2007 and 2006 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 276 million and 282 million respectively of which 57 million and 65 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2007 2006 and 2005 totaled 12 million 207 million and 27 million respectively cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 19 million 22 million and 14 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively environmental remediation of a former chromium manufacturing plant site and associated sites in jersey city nj represented the major part of our 2006 environmental charges and our existing reserves included in the amounts mentioned above were 185 million of 2006 charges against income and 195 million and 198 million in reserves at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively associated with all new jersey chromium sites 

  

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time 

  

charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites excluding 2006 pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year for the past 15 years we anticipate that charges against income in 2008 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range 

  

in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters 

  

there are growing public and governmental concerns related to climate change which have led to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions believed to be responsible these concerns were reflected in the 2005 framework for ghg reduction under the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change the kyoto protocol has been adopted by many countries where ppg operates including the european union and canada but not in the us the european union has implemented a cap and trade approach with a mandatory emissions trading scheme for ghgs in december 2007 delegates to the united nations framework convention on climate change reached agreement on development of a plan for the second phase of kyoto scheduled to start in 2013 this could potentially lead to further reduction requirements a substantial portion of ppg’s ghg emissions are generated by locations in the us however at this time it is uncertain whether the us will set ghg reduction goals under the kyoto protocol or by some other mechanism ppg has joined the usbased climate registry to assist in verification of current and future ghg reduction achievements in preparation for potential imposition in the us of ghg reduction goals 

  

energy prices and scarcity of supply continue to be a concern for major energy users since ppg’s ghg emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels ppg has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and ghg generation we committed under the business roundtable’s climate 

  

   

resolve program to reduce our ghg intensity ghgs produced per million dollars of revenue by 18 between 2002 and 2012 ppg achieved this target in 2006 six years ahead of schedule recognizing the continuing importance of this matter ppg has appointed an energy security and climate change steering group to guide the company’s progress in this area additionally in 2007 ppg announced new corporate targets namely i a reduction in energy intensity by 25 from 2006 to 2016 and ii a 10 absolute reduction in ghg emissions from 2006 to 2011 ppg’s public disclosure on energy security and climate change can be viewed at the carbon disclosure project wwwcdprojectnet

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings glass and chemicals products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business 

  

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy including natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each onedollar change in our unit price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs in 2007 natural gas costs declined slightly in the us compared to 2006 levels yearoveryear coatings raw material costs rose by 40 million in 2007 following a rise of 75 million in 2006 additionally certain raw materials are critical to our production processes these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses lenses photochromic dye sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses we have made and plan to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future however an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products 

  

we experience substantial competition from certain lowcost regions 

growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world including asia eastern europe and latin america where energy and labor costs are lower than those in the us could result in lower selling prices or reduced demand for some of our glass and fiber glass products 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment 

excluding 2006 pretax charges against income for environmental remediation ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year over the past 15 years in 2006 those charges totaled 207 million we have accrued 276 million for estimated remediation costs that are probable at december 31 2007 our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation if necessary of such environmental contingencies and the potential for technological and regulatory developments as such in addition to the amounts currently reserved we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 300 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount 

  

for over 30 years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation “pc” ppg is a 50 shareholder of pc although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome 

  

   

could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

  

we sell products to usbased automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers 

the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change including the loss of us market share by general motors ford and chrysler further deterioration of market conditions could cause certain of our customers and suppliers to have liquidity problems potentially resulting in the writeoff of amounts due from these customers and cost impacts of changing suppliers 

  

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

because we are a global company our results are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 80 of sales and operating income in 2007 was generated by products sold in the united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and latin america with the acquisition of sigmakalon in january 2008 we have increased our international operations as substantially all of its sales are outside the united states 

  

as a producer of chemicals we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature 

we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner however these materials if mishandled or released into the environment could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us in addition evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs 

  

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages natural disasters and severe weather events fires or war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and to deliver products to customers 

  

the failure to successfully integrate the acquisition of sigmakalon could adversely affect our financial results 

on january 2 2008 we completed the acquisition of sigmakalon a worldwide coatings producer based in uithoorn netherlands the total cost of the transaction including assumed debt was approximately 32 billion in the event that we do not successfully integrate sigmakalon into our operations our consolidated operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our performance is affected by the economic conditions in the us and in other nations where we do business 

declining economic conditions may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows overall demand for our products could be reduced as a direct result of an economic recession

generally the company’s plants are suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are intended and overall have sufficient capacity to conduct business in the upcoming year 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s business to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

  

the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

for over 30 years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status 

  

   

of the proposed ppg settlement arrangement announced may 14 2002 see note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

over the past several years the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

  

ppg received a notice of violation in july 2007 from the north carolina department of environment and natural resources division of air quality regarding alleged exceedances of air opacity limits at its shelby north carolina fiber glass facility ppg settled this matter in the fourth quarter for stipulated civil penalty of 75000

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

presentation of discontinued operations 

during the third quarter of 2007 the company entered into an agreement to sell its automotive glass businesses to platinum equity “platinum” for approximately 500 million accordingly the assets and liabilities of these businesses were classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2007 ppg was notified that affiliates of platinum had filed suit in the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york alleging that platinum was not obligated to consummate the agreement platinum subsequently terminated the agreement ppg has sued platinum and certain of its affiliates for damages including the 25 million breakup fee stipulated by the terms of the agreement based on various alleged actions of the platinum parties 

  

while the transaction with platinum was terminated ppg management remains committed to a sale of the automotive glass businesses accordingly the assets and liabilities of these businesses continue to be classified as held for sale and are stated at depreciated cost which is lower than fair value less cost to sell in the consolidated balance sheet under item 8 of this form 10k as of december 31 2007 and 2006 further the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses which had previously been included in the glass reportable segment have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under item 8 for the three years ended december 31 2007 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

the decision to sell these businesses triggered curtailments related to certain of ppg’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2007 ppg recorded a pretax charge of 17 million 11 million aftertax primarily representing curtailment losses on certain defined benefit pension plans the sale of these businesses may result in additional curtailments and possibly settlements of other ppg employee benefit plans to be recorded upon or after the closing of a sale 

  

in the third quarter of 2007 ppg entered into an agreement to sell its fine chemicals business to zach system spa a subsidiary of zambon company spa for approximately 65 million the sale of this business was completed in november 2007 accordingly the assets and liabilities of this business have been reclassified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet under item 8 as of december 31 2006 further the results of operations and cash flows of this business which had previously been included in the optical and specialty materials reportable segment have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under item 8 for the three years ended december 31 2007 ppg recorded a pretax loss on sale of the fine chemicals business of 25 million 19 million aftertax in 2007 

  

performance in 2007 compared with 2006 

  

performance overview 

our sales increased 14 to 112 billion in 2007 compared to 99 billion in 2006 sales increased 6 due to the impact of acquisitions 4 due to increased volumes and 4 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 632 compared to 624 in 2006 due to the adverse impact of inflation net of selling price changes selling general and administrative expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 191 compared to 186 in 2006 these costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to growth including increased advertising costs and the impact of inflation 

  

business restructuring expense decreased 35 million in 2007 in 2006 the company finalized plans for certain actions to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities and recorded a charge of 35 million 

  

other charges decreased 193 million in 2007 the reduction was primarily due to a reduction in environmental expenses which were 195 million lower in 2007 as compared to 2006 

  

other earnings increased 24 million in 2007 due to higher royalty income higher interest income and gains from asset sales 

  

net income and earnings per share – assuming dilution for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below 

  

  

   

     

results of reportable business segments 

  

   

performance coatings sales increased 723 million or 23 in 2007 sales increased 15 due to sales from acquisitions in all three performance coatings businesses 4 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and 3 due to improved sales volumes in our aerospace and automotive refinish businesses which more than offset slightly lower volumes in architectural coatings the volume growth in the aerospace and refinish businesses occurred throughout the world while the volume decline in architectural coatings was in north america sales also increased 1 due to higher selling prices segment income increased 49 million to a total of 563 million in 2007 factors increasing segment income were improved sales volumes earnings from acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

additionally the benefit of higher selling prices more than offset the impact of inflation segment income decreased due to higher overhead costs to support growth initiatives in this segment 

  

industrial coatings sales increased 410 million or 13 in 2007 sales increased 6 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation 4 due to acquisitions in our automotive and industrial coatings businesses and 3 from improved sales volumes as volume increases in automotive coatings and packaging coatings more than offset declines in the volume of the industrial coatings business in the us and canada volume growth in the automotive coatings businesses occurred in all regions of the world while the volume growth in packaging coatings was experienced mainly in asia and europe the decline in industrial coatings’ north american volumes overshadowed solid growth for this business in europe asia and latin america segment income increased 21 million in 2007 due to improved sales volumes the impact of acquisitions lower manufacturing costs and the positive impact of foreign currency translation factors decreasing segment income were inflation including higher raw material costs which more than offset a slight improvement in selling prices and increased overhead costs to support growth initiatives 

  

optical and specialty materials sales increased 125 million or 14 in 2007 sales increased 8 due to higher volumes primarily in the optical products business 4 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation 1 as the result of sales from acquisitions in the optical products business and 1 due to higher selling prices segment income increased 18 million in 2007 the increase in segment income was primarily the result of the increased sales volumes partially offset by higher advertising expense related to optical products volume growth initiatives in all regions and to the impending launch of transitions optical’s next generation lens product in the first quarter of 2008 

  

commodity chemicals sales increased 56 million or 4 in 2007 sales increased 9 due to higher sales volumes of caustic and derivatives which was partially offset by a 5 decrease in selling prices in part due to lower natural gas input costs segment income decreased 42 million in 2007 segment income was lower in large part due to lower selling prices higher manufacturing costs including maintenance costs and higher raw material costs segment income also decreased as a result of the absence of an insurance recovery received in 2006 for damage caused by hurricane rita in 2005 the benefit of lower energy and environmental costs and improved sales volumes were factors that increased segment income in 2007 

  

glass sales increased by 31 million or 3 in 2007 sales increased 3 due to higher sales volumes and 2 due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation the negative impact of lower selling prices in our performance glazings business reduced segment sales by 2 pricing in the performance glazings business includes a surcharge related to the cost of energy lagged by one quarter the surcharge in 2006 exceeded the current year surcharge due to higher energy costs during the comparable periods segment income decreased 9 million in 2007 segment income decreased due to the negative impact of inflation and lower pricing including the lower energy surcharge in performance glazings these factors were only partially offset by the benefit from higher sales volumes 

  

see note 24 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to the company’s operating segments and reportable business segments 

  

other significant factors 

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007 was 286 compared to 251 in 2006 the rate in 2007 includes the benefit of 15 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against the benefit of a tax net operating loss carryforward the benefit associated with an enacted reduction in the canadian federal corporate income tax rate and a tax benefit of 39 on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement as discussed in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the tax rate was 303 on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007 the effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included the benefit of a tax refund from canada resulting from the favorable resolution of a tax dispute dating back to 1998 and a tax benefit related to the settlement with the internal revenue service of our tax returns for the years 20012003 in the aggregate these benefits reduced 2006 income tax expense by 39 million the 2006 effective tax rate also included a tax benefit of 36 on the charge for business restructuring and a tax benefit of 39 on the third quarter environmental remediation charge for sites in new jersey and louisiana on the charges for legal settlements and on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement income tax expense of 39 was recognized on certain insurance recoveries and income tax expense of 31 was recognized on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2006 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 was 476 compared to 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

378 in 2006 the rate in 2007 includes a tax benefit of 35 on the curtailment charge related to the automotive glass businesses and a tax benefit of 24 on the loss on the sale of the fine chemicals business the tax rate was 39 on the remaining pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 

  

outlook 

in 2007 the us and overall north american economy continued a slowing trend which began during the second half of 2006 us gross domestic product “gdp” increased about 2 for the year growth rates slowed in several us endmarkets in the latter part of the year but the growth rates were aided by higher exports and decreased imports us residential construction rates declined approximately 25 yearoveryear and north american vehicle production decreased by 3 despite these and other slowing markets overall industrial production increased by 2 industrial production remains the economic metric that most positively correlates with our us organic volume growth because it reflects activity in ppg’s broad enduse markets the us commercial construction sector continued to grow consistently throughout the year increasing by approximately 15 

  

overall inflation remained modest as low labor rates in emerging regions have continued to hold labor rates in the mature regions relatively flat global energy prices primarily oil and other basic raw material costs increased to new or close to new record high levels natural gas costs in the us declined for the second consecutive year but remain at elevated levels when viewed historically 

  

the european economy grew at one of its highest rates in the past decade due to continued industrial activity and higher consumer spending western european vehicle production improved by 3 and eastern european automotive production grew by nearly 18 overall industrial production grew by 25 

  

the asian economies continued to post very high growth rates both relative to other major economies and historically driven by strong growth in china and india chinese industrial production once again grew at just under 20 supported in part by growth exceeding 20 in automobile production overall china gdp improved by 11 for the second consecutive year 

  

entering 2008 the overall economic outlook is generally bearish with many economists concerned about the potential of a us recession and its potential impact on the overall global economy meanwhile inflation concerns have risen in basic materials due primarily to oil prices which are at or close to alltime record highs interest rates which had been rising in many of the world’s major economies are now expected to decrease or remain flat due to lower anticipated growth rates 

  

overall global growth is expected to continue as rapidly growing emerging regions including china india latin america and eastern europe continue to grow into a more meaningful portion of the global economy despite slowing in the us economy and a variety of government actions in china designed to slow its growth rate these emerging economies are expected to continue to produce growth rates well above those in more mature economies due in part to ongoing internal infrastructure expansion this growth has benefited global companies such as ppg as evidenced in 2007 when ppg grew organically by over 10 in these emerging regions 

  

in 2008 we expect cost pressures in certain raw materials transportation and healthcare to remain as ppg has historically done we anticipate offsetting these cost increases with aggressive raw material sourcing manufacturing cost improvements productivity gains and selling price increases 

  

our pension and post retirement benefit costs totaled 233 million in 2007 including a curtailment charge of 17 million related to discontinued operations excluding the curtailment charge these costs decreased by 55 million compared to 2006 based on our current estimates we expect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs to decline by approximately 20 million in 2008 this decline is due primarily to an increase in the discount rate for 2008 as well as the impact of the 100 million contribution we made to our us pension plans in 2007 

  

with respect to energy costs 2007 natural gas costs remained high but declined as compared to 2006 changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each one dollar change in our price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs our 2007 natural gas costs averaged about 750 per mmbtu for the year while our 2006 costs averaged about 800 while it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we use a variety of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging we currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2008 will be higher than the first quarter of 2007 we currently have nearly 40 of our first quarter 2008 natural gas purchases hedged at a price of about 875 and approximately 30 of our 2008 annual requirements hedged at about 825 

  

over the past few years we have also experienced increases in the prices we pay for raw materials used in many of our businesses particularly in our coatings 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

businesses the increases have resulted from global industrial expansion supplydemand imbalance and increases in supplier feedstock costs we have and plan to continue to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate and global supply sources for our raw materials reformulating our products improving our production processes and raising our selling prices yearoveryear coatings raw material costs rose by 75 million in 2006 and the rate of increase slowed to approximately 40 million in 2007 which represented about a one percent increase our current forecast for the early portion of 2008 is for coatings raw material inflation likely in the two to four percent range supported primarily by higher oil prices however full year raw material inflation may increase or decrease with the main driver likely being overall economic conditions and resulting supply and demand factors 

  

in 2007 we completed several acquisitions that are intended to strengthen our coatings businesses by extending their geographic breadth in addition several acquisitions were completed in the middle or toward the end of 2006 the sales for businesses held for less than one year added slightly less than 600 million to ppg’s 2007 sales with operating margins approaching but just below coatings industry averages 

  

also in 2007 we sold our fine chemicals business and our azdel fiber glass joint venture and closed our venezulean fiber glass joint venture additionally we signed a contract for the sale of our automotive glass businesses however this contract was later terminated by the purchaser nevertheless we intend to sell the automotive glass businesses during 2008 

  

on january 2 2008 ppg completed the purchase of sigmakalon a worldwide coatings producer based in the netherlands for approximately 32 billion ppg expects 2008 sales from this acquisition of about 3 billion this acquisition is not expected to be accretive to ppg’s earnings in 2008 due in part to certain acquisition related costs ppg utilized interim debt financing upon closing of the transaction and will install longerterm financing during 2008 the acquisition greatly extends ppg’s european coatings operations and customer breadth and is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2009 

  

economic conditions entering 2008 are challenging due primarily to continued softness in several us markets and concern over global credit issues the acquisition of sigmakalon will result in a shift of our geographic sales mix as now less than 50 of our sales will be derived in the us and canada we anticipate continued organic growth in 2008 due to this more diverse geographic sales mix along with our larger sales base in emerging regions we anticipate this growth coupled with our focus on cost improvement will allow us to continue with our legacy of cash generation for the ongoing benefit of our shareholders 

  

accounting standard adopted in 2007 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the company adopted the provisions of fin no 48 as of january 1 2007 as a result of the implementation of fin no 48 the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by 11 million which was recorded as a direct increase in retained earnings refer to note 13 “income taxes” under item 8 for additional information 

  

accounting standards to be adopted in future years 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 157 “fair value measurements” which defines fair value establishes a framework in generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this standard only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities it does not increase the use of fair value measurement sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 except as it relates to nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 the company evaluated the impact of adopting this statement and concluded it will not have a significant effect on ppg’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities – including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company evaluated the impact of adopting this statement and concluded it will not have an effect on ppg’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” sfas no141r which replaces sfas no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r retains the underlying 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

concepts of sfas no 141 in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting but sfas no 141r changes the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinitelived intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense sfas no 141r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december 15 2008 with an exception related to the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired contingencies related to acquisitions completed before the effective date sfas no 141r amends sfas no 109 to require adjustments made after the effective date of this statement to valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and income tax positions to be recognized as income tax expense beginning january 1 2009 ppg will apply the provisions of sfas no 141r to its accounting for applicable business combinations 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” this statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 sfas no 160 requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent’s equity the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement sfas no 160 amends certain of arb no 51’s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of sfas no 141r  this statement requires changes in the parent’s ownership interest of consolidated subsidiaries to be accounted for as equity transactions this statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest we are currently evaluating the effects that sfas no 160 may have on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in november 2007 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued eitf issue no 071 “accounting for collaborative arrangements” which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and disclosure requirements for such arrangements eitf 071 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the company is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting the provisions eitf 071 however it does not anticipate that adoption will have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

  

in march 2007 eitf issue no 0610 “accounting for collateral assignment splitdollar life insurance arrangements” was issued under the provisions of eitf 0610 an employer is required to recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment splitdollar life insurance arrangement in accordance with either sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” or accounting principles board opinion no 12 “omnibus opinion – 1967” if the employer has agreed to maintain a life insurance policy during the employee’s retirement or provide the employee with a death benefit based on the substantive arrangement with the employee the provisions of eitf 0610 also require an employer to recognize and measure the asset in a collateral assignment splitdollar life insurance arrangement based on the nature and substance of the arrangement eitf 0610 is effective as of january 1 2008 ppg has collateral assignment splitdollar life insurance arrangements within the scope of eitf 0610 the company will adopt the provisions of eitf 0610 as of january 1 2008 and does not expect it to have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

  

performance in 2006 compared with 2005 

  

performance overview 

our sales increased 9 to 99 billion in 2006 compared to 90 billion in 2005 sales increased 4 due to the impact of acquisitions 2 due to increased volumes 2 due to increased selling prices and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 624 compared to 620 in 2005 due to the adverse impact of inflation net of selling price changes selling general and administrative expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 186 compared to 180 in 2005 these costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to expansion of the companyowned store network in our architectural coatings business and increased advertising to promote sales growth in our optical products business 

  

business restructuring expense increased 35 million in 2006 as the company finalized plans for certain actions to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities and recorded a related charge 

  

other charges decreased 56 million in 2006 other charges in 2006 included pretax charges of 185 million for estimated environmental remediation costs at sites in 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

new jersey and 42 million for legal settlements offset in part by pretax earnings of 44 million for insurance recoveries related to the marvin legal settlement and to hurricane rita other charges in 2005 included pretax charges of 132 million related to the marvin legal settlement net of related insurance recoveries of 18 million 61 million for the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement 34 million of direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes rita and katrina and 19 million for debt refinancing costs 

  

other earnings increased 24 million in 2006 due to higher equity earnings primarily from our asian fiber glass joint ventures and higher royalty income 

  

net income and earnings per share – assuming dilution for 2006 and 2005 are summarized below 

  

   

      

results of reportable business segments 

  

   

performance coatings sales increased 420 million or 16 in 2006 sales increased 8 due to acquisitions 4 due to higher selling prices in the refinish aerospace and architectural coatings businesses 3 due to increased volumes in our aerospace and architectural coatings businesses and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation segment income increased 50 million in 2006 the increase in segment income was primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume and higher selling prices which more than offset the impact of inflation segment income was reduced by increased overhead costs to support growth in our architectural coatings business 

  

industrial coatings sales increased 315 million or 11 in 2006 sales increased 4 due to acquisitions 4 due to increased volumes in the automotive industrial and packaging coatings businesses 2 due to higher selling prices particularly in the industrial and packaging coatings businesses and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation segment income increased 65 million in 2006 the increase in segment income was primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume lower overhead and manufacturing costs and the impact of acquisitions segment income was reduced by the adverse impact of inflation which was substantially offset by higher selling prices 

  

optical and specialty materials sales increased 113 million or 14 in 2006 sales increased 8 due to higher volumes particularly in optical products 5 due to acquisitions in our optical products business and 1 due to higher selling prices segment income increased 18 million in 2006 the increase in segment income was primarily due to increased volumes lower manufacturing costs and the absence of the 2005 hurricane costs of 3 million net of 2006 insurance recoveries which were only partially offset by increased overhead costs in our optical products business to support growth and the negative impact of inflation 

  

commodity chemicals sales decreased 48 million or 3 in 2006 sales decreased 4 due to lower chloralkali volumes and increased 1 due to higher selling prices segment income decreased 28 million in 2006 the yearoveryear decline in segment income was due primarily to lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels the absence of the 2005 charges for direct costs related to hurricanes increased segment income by 29 million the impact of higher selling prices lower inflation primarily natural gas costs and an insurance recovery of 10 million related to the 2005 hurricane losses also increased segment income in 2006 

  

our fourthquarter chloralkali sales volumes and earnings were negatively impacted by production outages at several customers over the last two months of 2006 

  

glass sales increased 33 million or 3 in 2006 sales increased 2 due to improved volumes in our performance glazings business and 1 due to higher 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

selling prices in performance glazings segment income increased 39 million in 2006 this increase in segment 

income was primarily the result of higher selling prices higher equity earnings from our asian fiber glass joint ventures higher other income and lower manufacturing and natural gas costs which more than offset the negative impacts of higher inflation and lower margin mix of sales 

  

our fiber glass business made progress during 2006 in achieving our multiyear plan to improve profitability and cash flow a transformation of our supply chain which includes production of a more focused product mix at each manufacturing plant manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and improved equity earnings from our asian joint ventures are the primary focus and represent the critical success factors in this plan during 2006 our new joint venture in china started producing high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products which allows us to refocus our us production capacity on higher margin direct process products the 2006 earnings improvement by our fiber glass business accounted for the bulk of the 2006 improvement in the glass reportable business segment income 

  

see note 24 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to our operating segments and reportable business segments 

  

other significant factors 

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2006 was 251 compared to 290 in 2005 the effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included the benefit of a tax refund from canada resulting from the favorable resolution of a tax dispute dating back to 1998 and a tax benefit related to the settlement with the internal revenue service of our tax returns for the years 20012003 in the aggregate these benefits reduced 2006 income tax expense by 39 million the 2006 effective tax rate also included a tax benefit of 36 on the charge for business restructuring and a tax benefit of 39 on the third quarter environmental remediation charge for sites in new jersey and louisiana on the charges for legal settlements and on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement as discussed in note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k income tax expense of 39 was recognized on certain insurance recoveries and income tax expense of 310 was recognized on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2006 the effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included a tax benefit of 39 on the charge for the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries the settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case the charge for debt refinancing costs and the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement the 2005 effective tax rate also included tax expense of 9 million related to dividends repatriated under the american jobs creation act of 2004 and tax expense of 303 on the remaining pretax earnings 

  

the effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2006 was 378 compared to 394 in 2005 

  

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed ppg settlement arrangement for asbestos claims announced on may 14 2002 and a description of the antitrust suits against ppg related to the flat glass and automotive refinish industries as discussed in item 3 and note 15 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the ppg settlement arrangement described in note 15 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time as of december 31 2007 and 2006 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 276 million and 282 million respectively of which 57 million and 65 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2007 2006 and 2005 totaled 12 million 207 million and 27 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the consolidated statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 19 million 22 million and 14 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation the company may be subject 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 300 million which range is unchanged since december 31 2006 such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and at the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites excluding 2006 pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year for the past 15 years we anticipate that charges against income in 2008 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range 

  

management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately 45 million in 2008 and to range from 35 million to 60 million annually through 2012 it is possible that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays specifically the level of expected cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to the former chromium manufacturing plant site in new jersey as ppg awaits approval of workplans that have been submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies 

  

impact of inflation 

in 2007 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material costs in our industrial coatings reportable segment was not offset by higher selling prices higher selling prices did offset the negative impact of inflation in our performance coatings and optical and specialty materials reportable segments however in our industrial coatings commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments the negative impact of inflation was not offset by higher selling prices 

  

in 2006 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material costs in our coatings businesses was offset by higher selling prices in our industrial coatings performance coatings and commodity chemicals reportable segments and by reduced manufacturing costs in our glass and optical and specialty materials reportable segments 

  

in 2005 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher coatings raw material costs and higher energy costs in our glass and commodity chemicals businesses were offset by higher selling prices in our commodity chemicals and performance coatings reportable segments but were not offset by the combination of higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs in our industrial coatings optical and specialty materials and glass reportable segments 

  

in 2008 we expect the negative impact of inflation on raw materials energy and employee benefit costs to slightly exceed the combined impacts of productivity improvements lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices lower manufacturing costs and productivity improvements are not expected to offset the negative impacts of lower selling prices and inflation primarily in the cost of raw materials and energy in our industrial coatings and commodity chemicals reporting segments in our remaining reportable segments the combination of higher selling prices lower manufacturing costs and productivity improvements is expected to more than offset negative inflationary impacts 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

  

cash from operating activities was 996 million  1115 million and 1071 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively capital spending was 584 million  738 million and 352 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively this spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses environmental control projects and business acquisitions which amounted to 231 million  387 million and 91 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we also assumed 80 million in debt in connection with acquisitions in 2006 capital spending excluding acquisitions is expected to be approximately 470 million during 2008 

  

total current assets less total current liabilities net working capital increased 436 million to 2475 million at december 31 2007 from 2039 million at december 31 2006 the increase in net working capital is principally related to the 374 million increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to 2006 the impact of foreign currency translation the impact of 2007 acquisitions and an increase in the business outside the us where the working capital intensity is greater accounts receivable as a percent of annual net sales for 2007 increased to 214 percent from 204 percent in 2006 days sales outstanding increased to 72 days in 2007 from 69 days in 2006 inventories as a percent of annual net sales remained stable at 122 percent in 2007 and 2006 inventory turnover decreased to 55 times in 2007 compared to 58 times in 2006 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

on january 2 2008 ppg completed the acquisition of sigmakalon group “sigmakalon” a worldwide coatings producer based in uithoorn netherlands from global private investment firm bain capital “the seller” sigmakalon produces architectural protective and marine and industrial coatings and is a leading coatings supplier in europe and other key markets across the globe with an increasing presence in africa and asia 

  

the total transaction value was approximately 32 billion consisting of cash paid to the seller of 1673 million and debt assumed of 1517 million the cash paid to the seller consisted of €717 million 1056 million and 617 million 

  

in order to provide financing for the sigmakalon acquisition in december 2007 ppg and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a three year €650 million revolving credit facility with several banks and financial institutions and societe generale as facility agent for the lenders in addition ppg and a subsidiary entered into two bridge loan agreements one in an amount of €1 billion with multiple lenders and credit suisse as administrative agent for those lenders and the other in the amount of 500 million with credit suisse as the lender each bridge loan has a term of 364 days 

  

in december 2007 ppg issued 617 million of commercial paper and borrowed 1056 million €717 million under the €1 billion bridge loan agreement the proceeds from these borrowings were deposited into escrow in december 2007 upon closing of the acquisition on january 2 2008 these amounts were released from escrow and paid to the seller also in january 2008 ppg borrowed 1143 million representing the remaining 417 million €283 million available under the €1 billion bridge loan agreement and 726 million €493 million under the €650 million revolving credit facility the proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand of 116 million were used to repay 1259 million of the sigmakalon debt assumed in the acquisition no amounts have been borrowed under the 500 million bridge loan agreement 

  

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 335 million  316 million and 316 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899 and 2007 marked the 36th consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders over time our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately onethird of our earnings per share 

  

during 2007 the company repurchased 37 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 274 million under a previously authorized share repurchase program during 2006 the company repurchased 23 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 153 million and during 2005 the company repurchased 94 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 607 million 

  

cash contributions to our employee stock ownership plan “esop” and related expense were reduced by 30 million in 2007 by the appreciation on old ppg shares purchased prior to december 31 1992 allocated to participant accounts during 2007 all such shares have been allocated to participants accounts as of december 31 2007 as such there will be no corresponding reduction in cash contributions to the esop or expense in 2008 

  

on august 17 2006 the pension protection act of 2006 the “ppa” was signed into law changing the funding requirements for our us defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008 under current funding requirements ppg did not have to make a mandatory contribution to our us plans in 2007 and we do not expect to have a mandatory contribution to these plans in 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact that ppa will have on our funding requirements for 2009 and beyond in 2007 2006 and 2005 we made voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans of 100 million 100 million and 4 million respectively and contributions to our nonus defined benefit pension plans of 49 million 24 million and 26 million respectively some of which were required by local funding requirements we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in 2008 of approximately 62 million and we may make voluntary contributions to our us plans 

  

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 42 at december 31 2007 and 28 at december 31 2006 the increase in 2007 is primarily due to the additional debt borrowed in december to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon on january 2 2008 

  

cash from operations and the company’s debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments contributions to pension plans amounts due under the proposed ppg settlement arrangement and operating requirements including ppg’s significant contractual obligations which are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the proposed ppg settlement arrangement 

  

   

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

       

the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases natural gas coal and electricity consistent with customary industry practice 

these also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 6 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

see note 9 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

  

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company has an automatic shelf registration on file with the sec pursuant to which it may issue offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 9 “debt and bank credit arrangements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

  

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 4 “working capital detail” note 13 “income taxes” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually see note 14 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

  

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption for 2008 is 645 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would increase 2008 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 10 million and 5 million respectively 

  

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2007 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 85 we will use the same assumption for 2008 a reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points with other assumptions held constant would increase 2008 net periodic pension expense by approximately 13 million 

  

net periodic benefit cost for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the year ended december 31 2005 was calculated using the 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

gam 83 mortality table a commonly used mortality table in 2006 we began to use rp 2000 a newer and more relevant mortality table to calculate net periodic benefit costs for these plans this change in the mortality assumption in 2006 increased net periodic benefit costs by approximately 13 million and 4 million for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans respectively 

  

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of december 31 2007 

  

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

  

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

currency 

  

during 2007 the us dollar weakened against certain of the currencies in the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the canadian dollar and the brazilian real the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets at december 31 2007 by 260 million compared to december 31 2006 in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2007 pretax earnings of 47 million 

  

during 2006 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling and the australian dollar the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by 179 million for the year ended december 31 2006 in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2006 pretax earnings of 9 million 

  

the us dollar was weaker than the euro and the british pound sterling for most of the first eight months of 2005 when compared with currency rates of 2004 the us dollar strengthened against these currencies during the last four months of 2005 the effects of translating the net assets of ppg’s operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar decreased consolidated net assets by 215 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the effect of currency rate changes over the course of the year had a net favorable effect on 2005 pretax earnings of 8 million 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

  

forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets which also depends on economic and political conditions foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates the impact of environmental regulations unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if ppg’s settlement agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

  

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 11 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

  

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2007 and 2006 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of december 31 2007 and 2006 were assets of 04 million and 2 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 would have been 03 million and 2 million respectively 

  

in december 2007 ppg borrowed €717 million under the €1 billion bridge loan agreement established in december 2007 to finance a portion of the anticipated acquisition of sigmakalon the euro proceeds were converted to 1056 million and deposited into escrow until the closing of the transaction on january 2 2008 on the same day the 1056 million was placed into escrow the company entered into a foreign currency forward contract to convert the us dollars back to €717 million a 10 decline in the value of the euro would have resulted in a decline in the fair value of this forward contract by 106 million which would have been substantially offset by a gain on the €717 million loan 

  

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt of 1636 million as of december 31 2007 and 472 million as of december 31 2006 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 203 million and 63 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of 6 million as of december 31 2007 and a liability of 7 million as of december 31 2006 the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by  8 million and 2 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately 10 million as of december 31 2007 and 2 million as of december 31 2006 further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately  48 million and 51 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

  

the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31 2007 and 2006 was a liability of 8 million and 25 million respectively these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to higher prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of december 31 2007 and 2006 of approximately  26 million and 23 million respectively 

  

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 11 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” and note 15 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of december 31 2007 and 2006 was an asset of  18 million and 14 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by 6 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 

  

   




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

none 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures

optical and specialty materials and commodity chemicals 

ppg is a major producer and supplier of chemicals ppg’s chemicals operations are comprised of two reportable business segments optical and specialty materials and commodity chemicals ppg’s optical and specialty materials reportable business segment is comprised of the optical products silica and fine chemicals operating segments the primary optical and specialty materials products are transitions ® lenses sunlenses optical materials and polarized film amorphous precipitated silicas for tire battery separator and other enduse markets teslin ® synthetic printing sheet used in such applications as waterproof labels epassports and identification cards and advanced intermediates and bulk active ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry transitions ® lenses are processed and distributed by ppg’s 51owned joint venture with essilor international in the optical and specialty materials businesses product quality and performance and technical service are the most critical competitive factors the optical and specialty materials businesses operate four plants in the united states and one in mexico outside north america these businesses operate three plants in thailand and one plant each in australia brazil france ireland italy the netherlands and the philippines the average number of persons employed by the optical and specialty materials reportable business segment during 2006 was 3000 

  

the commodity chemicals reportable business segment produces chloralkali and derivative products including chlorine caustic soda vinyl chloride monomer chlorinated solvents chlorinated benzenes calcium hypochlorite ethylene dichloride and phosgene derivatives most of these products are sold directly to manufacturing companies in the chemical processing rubber and plastics paper minerals metals and water treatment industries ppg competes with six other major producers of chloralkali products price product availability product quality and customer service are the key competitive factors the chloralkali business operates three production facilities in the united states and one each in canada and taiwan the two largest facilities are located in lake charles la and natrium w va ppg also owns equity interests in operations in the united states the average number of persons employed by the commodity chemicals reportable business segment during 2006 was 1900 

glass 

ppg is a major producer of flat and fabricated glass in north america and a major global producer of continuousstrand fiber glass the glass reportable business segment is comprised of the automotive oem glass automotive replacement glass and services performance glazings and fiber glass operating segments ppg’s major markets are commercial and residential construction the furniture and electronics industries automotive original equipment and automotive aftermarket most glass products are sold directly to manufacturing companies however in the automotive replacement glass business products are sold directly to independent distributors and through ppg distribution outlets ppg manufactures flat glass by the float process and fiber glass by the continuousstrand process ppg also provides third party claims management services to insurance and vehicle fleet companies 

  

the bases for competition in the glass businesses are price quality technology and customer service the company competes with six major producers of flat glass six major producers of fabricated glass and three major producers of fiber glass throughout the world in certain glass and fiber glass markets there is increasing competition from other producers operating in low labor cost countries 

  

ppg’s principal glass production facilities are in north america and europe fourteen plants operate in the united states of which six produce automotive original and replacement glass products five produce flat glass and three produce fiber glass products there are three plants in canada two of which produce automotive original and replacement glass products and one which produces flat glass one plant each in england and the netherlands produces fiber glass ppg owns equity interests in operations in china mexico taiwan the united states and venezuela and a majority interest in a glass distribution company in japan additionally there are four satellite operations in the united states two in

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success our primary energy cost is natural gas used in our glass and commodity chemicals businesses in 2006 natural gas costs declined slightly in the us compared to record 2005 levels this decline was due in large part to relatively low hurricane activity in the us gulf coast and record high natural gas inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2005 prices were elevated due in large part to the adverse impact on supply of the high level of hurricane activity in the gulf coast in 2006 our coatings raw material costs increased by approximately three percent following an approximate ten percent rise in 2005 in addition the growth of global industrial production particularly in china and the united states and a slowing in the rate at which our suppliers have added production capacity in north america have resulted not only in upward pressure on price but also increased the importance of managing our supply chain 

  

the company’s most significant raw materials are titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses and sand soda ash and polyvinyl butyral in the glass businesses energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass businesses most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible we have aggressive sourcing initiatives underway to support our continuous efforts to find the lowest total material costs these initiatives include reformulation of certain of our products as part of a product renewal strategy and qualifying multiple sources of supply including supplies from asia and other lower cost regions of the world 

  

we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals that impact or could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards in december 2006 european union member states gave their final approval to comprehensive chemical management legislation known as “reach” the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach applies to all existing and new chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the european union in quantities greater than one metric ton per year the legislation requires that all such substances be preregistered by dec 31 2008 subsequently reach will require the registration testing and authorization of these preregistered chemicals over an 11year period we are currently reviewing our product portfolio to identify substances that may require preregistration additionally we are working with our suppliers to understand the future availability and viability of the raw materials we use in our production processes we anticipate that reach will result in incremental costs to ppg and our suppliers and may result in some of the chemicals we use being regulated or restricted however at this time it is not possible to quantify the financial impact on ppg’s businesses 

  

research and development 

research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities during 2006 2005 and 2004 were 334 million  325 million and 321 million respectively ppg owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development involving new and improved products and processes additional process and product research and development work is also undertaken at many of the company’s manufacturing plants as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our costs effectively we have a laboratory in china and an outsourcing arrangement with a laboratory in the ukraine and have been actively pursuing government funding of a small but growing portion of our research efforts 

  

patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important the company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg received 44 million in 2006  38 million in 2005 and 40 million in 2004 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

  

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

  

nonus operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations and as a result we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 85 of sales and operating income is generated by products sold in the 

  

   

united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and latin america 

  

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2006 was 32200 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world while we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms to date these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on the ppg’s operating results overall the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

  

environmental matters 

ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 14 million 18 million and 11 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2007 will approximate 24 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase 

  

additionally about 20 of our chloralkali production capacity currently utilizes mercury cell technology we strive to operate these cells in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and these cells are reviewed at least annually by state authorities the us environmental protection agency “usepa” has issued new regulations imposing significantly more stringent requirements on mercury emissions these new rules took effect in december 2006 in order to meet the usepa’s new air quality standards in july 2005 a decision was made to replace the existing mercury cell production unit at our lake charles la chloralkali plant with newer membrane cell technology the louisiana department of environmental quality has granted a one year extension to meet the new requirements on mercury emissions this capital project began in 2005 and will continue through mid2007 we do not expect the project to materially increase ppg’s total capital spending in 2007 

  

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 95 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 22 sites on the national priority list the number of sites is comparable with the prior year while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 282 million and 94 million respectively of which 65 million and 29 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2006 2005 and 2004 totaled 207 million 27 million and 15 million respectively cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 22 million 14 million and 26 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively environmental remediation of a former chromium manufacturing plant site and associated sites in jersey city nj represents the major part of our 2006 environmental charges and reserves included in the amounts mentioned above were 185 million of 2006 charges against income and 198 million in reserves at dec 31 2006 associated with all new jersey chromium sites 

  

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time over the 15 years prior to 2006 the pretax charges against income ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range as a result of our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and at the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant which efforts resulted in a pretax charge of 173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites we anticipate that charges against income in 2007 for environmental remediation costs will be within the prior historical range in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global manufacturer of coatings glass and chemicals products we operate in a business environment that includes risks these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results financial position and liquidity while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business 

  

increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results 

our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy including natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each onedollar change in the unit price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs all time record high natural gas costs in north america were reached in 2005 following the severe hurricanes that impacted the us gulf coast in the third quarter in 2006 natural gas costs in north america remained high by historical standards but did decline slightly versus the 2005 levels yearoveryear coatings raw material costs rose by 75 million in 2006 following a rise of 245 million in 2005 additionally certain raw materials are critical to our production processes these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the industrial coatings and performance and applied coatings businesses and sand soda ash and polyvinyl butyral in the glass businesses the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future however an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products 

  

we experience substantial competition from certain lowcost regions 

growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world including asia eastern europe and latin america where energy and labor costs are lower than those in the us could result in lower selling prices or reduce demand for some of our glass and fiber glass products 

  

our facilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations 

pretax charges against income for environmental remediation ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year over the 15 years prior to 2006 in 2006 those charges totaled 207 million we have accrued 282 million for estimated remediation costs that are probable at dec 31 2006 in addition to the amounts currently reserved the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 300 million such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought 

the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount 

  

for over thirty years we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 

most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by a 50 owned joint venture pittsburgh corning corporation although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and if not approved the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period 

  

we sell products to usbased automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers 

the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change including the loss of us market share by general motors ford and daimler chrysler further deterioration of market conditions could cause certain of our customers and suppliers to have liquidity problems potentially resulting in the writeoff of amounts due from these customers and cost impacts of changing suppliers 

  

our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 

because we are a global company our results are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 85 of sales and operating income is generated by products sold in the united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and latin america 

  

   

as a producer of chemicals and coatings we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature 

we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner however these materials if mishandled or released into the environment could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us in addition evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs 

  

business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including supply disruptions temporary plant andor power outages natural disasters and severe weather events fires or war or terrorist activities could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg our customers and our suppliers it is not possible for ppg to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events however such events could make it difficult or impossible for ppg to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to customers or reduce demand for ppg’s products 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 

  




 item 2 properties 

see “item 1 business” for information on ppg’s production and fabrication facilities 

  

generally the company’s plants are suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are intended and overall have sufficient capacity to conduct business in the upcoming year 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to contract patent environmental product liability antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s business to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

  

the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

for over thirty years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed ppg settlement arrangement announced may 14 2002 see note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

over the past several years the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

  

in 2005 we received a notice of violation “nov” and notice of intent to issue a further nov from the state of north carolina department of environment and natural resources related to our shelby north carolina fiber glass plant specifically the novs related to noncompliant stack air emissions tests in 2005 conducted under the requirements of the clean air act title v regulations in 2006 ppg resolved these novs by entering into a special order by consent “soc” with the north carolina environmental management commission the “emc” pursuant to which ppg paid a civil penalty of 52000 

  

   

in an unrelated matter ppg and the emc entered into an soc in june 2004 pursuant to which ppg agreed to achieve certain specified emission limits for particulate matter from a furnace at the lexington facility by dec 31 2007 in march 2006 ppg requested an extension of the dec 31 2007 deadline for achieving the emission limits for particulate matter until dec 31 2009 the emc has agreed in principal to this extension and has proposed that ppg and emc enter into a new soc which would include among other things a stipulated civil penalty of 125000 and a commitment by ppg to pay an additional 1102500 penalty in the event ppg were to shut down the furnace without installing an emission control system for particulate matter by dec 31 2011 in ppg’s experience matters such as these often can be resolved with civil penalty amounts below 100000 however ppg cannot predict the amount if any of the civil penalty that may be assessed for this matter

our sales increased 8 to 110 billion in 2006 compared to 102 billion in 2005 sales increased 4 due to the impact of acquisitions 2 due to increased volumes and 2 due to increased selling prices 

cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 637 compared to 635 in 2005 selling general and administrative expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 179 compared to 174 in 2005 these costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to store expansions in our architectural coatings operating segment and increased advertising to promote growth in our optical products operating segment 

  

other charges decreased 81 million in 2006 other charges in 2006 included pretax charges of 185 million for estimated environmental remediation costs at sites in new jersey and 42 million for legal settlements offset in part by pretax earnings of 44 million for insurance recoveries related to the marvin legal settlement and to hurricane rita other charges in 2005 included pretax charges of 132 million related to the marvin legal settlement net of related insurance recoveries of 18 million 61 million for the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement 34 million of direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes rita and katrina 27 million for an asset impairment charge in our fine chemicals operating segment and 19 million for debt refinancing costs 

  

other earnings increased 30 million in 2006 due to higher equity earnings primarily from our asian fiber glass joint ventures and higher royalty income 

  

net income and earnings per share – assuming dilution for 2006 were 711 million and 427 respectively compared to 596 million and 349 respectively for 2005 net income in 2006 included aftertax charges of 106 million or 64 cents a share for estimated environmental remediation costs at sites in new jersey and louisiana in the third quarter 26 million or 15 cents a share for legal settlements 23 million or 14 cents a share for business restructuring 17 million or 10 cents a share to reflect the net increase in the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement and aftertax earnings of 24 million or 14 cents a share for insurance recoveries net income in 2005 included aftertax charges of 117 million or 68 cents a share for legal settlements net of insurance 21 million or 12 cents a share for direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 17 million or 10 cents a share related to an asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals operating segment 12 million or 7 cents a share for debt refinancing cost and 13 million or 8 cents a share to reflect the net increase in the current 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement the legal settlements net of insurance included aftertax charges of 80 million for the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries of 11 million and 37 million for the impact of the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement 

  

results of reportable business segments 

   

industrial coatings sales increased 315 million or 11 in 2006 sales increased 4 due to acquisitions 4 due to increased volumes in the automotive industrial and packaging coatings operating segments 2 due to higher selling prices particularly in the industrial and packaging coatings businesses and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation segment income increased 65 million in 2006 the increase in segment income was primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume lower overhead and manufacturing costs and the impact of acquisitions segment income was reduced by the adverse impact of inflation which was substantially offset by higher selling prices 

  

performance and applied coatings sales increased 420 million or 16 in 2006 sales increased 8 due to acquisitions 4 due to higher selling prices in the refinish aerospace and architectural coatings operating segments 3 due to increased volumes in our aerospace and architectural coatings businesses and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation segment income increased 50 million in 2006 the increase in segment income was primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume and higher selling prices which more than offset the impact of inflation segment income was reduced by increased overhead costs to support growth in our architectural coatings business 

  

optical and specialty materials sales increased 134 million or 15 in 2006 sales increased 10 due to higher volumes particularly in optical products and fine chemicals and 5 due to acquisitions in our optical products business segment income increased 65 million in 2006 the absence of the 2005 charge for an asset impairment in our fine chemicals business increased segment income by 27 million the remaining 38 million increase in segment income was primarily due to increased volumes lower manufacturing costs and the absence of the 2005 hurricane costs of 3 million net of 2006 insurance recoveries which were only partially offset by increased overhead costs in our optical products business to support growth and the negative impact of inflation 

  

commodity chemicals sales decreased 48 million or 3 in 2006 sales decreased 4 due to lower chloralkali volumes and increased 1 due to higher selling prices segment income decreased 28 million in 2006 the yearoveryear decline in segment income was due primarily to lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels the absence of the 2005 charges for direct costs related to hurricanes increased segment income by 29 million the impact of higher selling prices lower inflation primarily natural gas costs and an insurance recovery of 10 million related to the 2005 hurricane losses also increased segment income in 2006 

  

our fourthquarter chloralkali sales volumes and earnings were negatively impacted by production outages at several customers over the last two months of 2006 it is uncertain when some of these customers will return to a normal level of production which may impact the sales and earnings of our chloralkali business in early 2007 

  

glass sales increased 15 million or 1 in 2006 sales increased 1 due to improved volumes resulting from a combination of organic growth and an acquisition a slight positive impact on sales due to foreign currency translation offset a slight decline in pricing volumes increased in the performance glazings automotive replacement glass and services and fiber glass businesses automotive oem glass volume declined during 2006 pricing was also up in performance glazings but declined in the other glass businesses segment income increased 25 million in 2006 this increase in segment income was primarily the result of higher equity earnings from our asian fiber glass joint ventures higher royalty income and lower manufacturing and natural gas costs which more than offset the negative impacts of higher inflation lower margin mix of sales and reduced selling prices 

  

our fiber glass operating segment made progress during 2006 in achieving our multiyear plan to improve profitability and cash flow a transformation of our supply chain which includes production of a more focused product mix at each manufacturing plant manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and improved equity earnings from our asian joint ventures are the primary focus and represent the critical success factors in this plan during 2006 our new joint venture in china started producing high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products which will allow us to refocus our us production capacity on higher margin direct process products the 2006 earnings improvement by our fiber glass operating segment accounted for the bulk of the 2006 improvement in the glass reportable business segment income 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

the 2006 earnings of our automotive oem glass operating segment declined year over year by 9 million following a decline of 30 million in 2005 significant structural changes continue to occur in the north american automotive industry including the loss of us market share by general motors ford and daimlerchrysler this has created a challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to the domestic oems including our operating segment in 2007 the automotive oem glass business will continue to focus on cost reduction developing new value added products and increasing sales volume 

  

we have an ongoing process that includes a review of our array of operating segments in relation to our overall strategic and performance objectives in 2007 this process will include considering alternatives for maximizing shareholder value these alternatives may include acquisitions restructure forming strategic alliances and divestiture as part of this process we are initially focused on the automotive oem glass automotive replacement glass and services and fine chemicals operating segments to that end we have engaged outside advisors to assist us in considering our alternatives including the potential sale of one or more of these operating segments 

  

see note 23 “reportable business segment information” under item 8 of this form 10k for further information related to our operating segments and reportable business segments 

  

other significant factors 

the effective tax rate for 2006 was 262 compared to 298 for 2005 the 2006 rate includes the benefit of a tax refund from canada resulting from the favorable resolution of a tax dispute dating back to 1997 and a tax benefit related to the settlement with the internal revenue service “irs” of our tax returns for the years 20012003 in the aggregate these benefits reduced 2006 income tax expense by 39 million the 2006 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of 36 on the charge for business restructuring and a tax benefit of 39 on the third quarter environmental remediation charge for sites in new jersey and louisiana on the charges for legal settlements and on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement as discussed in note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k income tax expense of 39 was recognized on certain insurance recoveries and income tax expense of 315 was recognized on the remaining pretax earnings the 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of 39 on the charge for the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries the settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case the asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals operating segment the charge for debt refinancing costs and the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement the 2005 effective tax rate also included tax expense of 9 million related to dividends repatriated under the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca 2004” and tax expense of 310 on the remaining pretax earnings our current estimate of the effective tax rate for 2007 is 315 

  

outlook 

in 2006 growth slowed in the us and overall north american economy during the year this growth rate decelerated more in the second half of the year due in part to both slower us residential construction and automobile production overall industrial production increased 3 for the year despite a 3 decrease in automotive production industrial production remains the economic metric that most positively correlates with our organic volume growth because it reflects activity in ppg’s broad enduse markets the us commercial construction sector continued to grow throughout the year recording growth of more than 15 a rate well above recent historical trends and overall us gdp growth the european economy grew at a fairly consistent rate throughout the year and overall industrial activity in most emerging regions of the world remained robust 

  

overall inflation rates remained fairly modest as labor rates were fairly flat through most of the world energy prices and other basic raw material costs remained high from an historical perspective with some costs increasing slightly while others declined during the year natural gas costs in the us declined from alltime record highs experienced at the end of 2005 which were due in part to supply disruptions resulting from the us hurricanes while oil costs remained at high levels through yearend 

  

the european economy grew at a rate of about 3 in 2006 the economic growth was fueled primarily by higher industrial production and lower unemployment rates the latter of which aided consumer spending european automotive production rose by about 3 as increases in eastern europe offset a slight decline in western europe overall industrial production expanded by about 1 

  

the asian economy continued to post very high growth relative to historical global trends industrial production which includes vehicle production among other subcategories grew at more than 15 in china 

  

entering 2007 many economists are predicting slower north american growth in the first half of the year compared with 2006 inflation will likely remain fairly 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

modest as globalization and productivity are expected to minimize labor cost inflation additionally a slower us economy would reduce demand for both energy and other commodity materials which could in turn impact costs favorably we currently expect interest rates in the us to decline at some point in 2007 but they may increase further in the european community 

  

overall global economic growth is expected to continue despite the moderation in the north american economy the global growth will continue to be stimulated by growth in the emerging regions of the world including china india and eastern europe western europe is expected to continue to expand but it may be at lower levels than 2006 due in part to a stronger euro and higher interest rates 

  

the strong growth in the emerging regions continues a trend that has been prevalent for several years economic growth in china will be sustained by both continued infrastructure expansion and unrelenting growth in its industrial base the infrastructure expansion will likely be helped by preparations for the 2008 olympics which will be held in china 

  

global companies such as ppg will continue to benefit by this overall global expansion as evidenced in 2006 where ppg’s nonus and noncanadian operations grew organically by almost 10 as this globalization increases customers seek both global solutions and global servicing 

  

in 2007 we expect continued cost pressures including certain raw materials transportation and healthcare costs we remain focused on offsetting these cost pressures through aggressive sourcing initiatives combined with manufacturing cost improvements productivity and selling price increases 

  

our pension and post retirement benefit costs totaled 271 million in 2006 reflecting an increase of 37 million from 2005 these costs remain well above their 2000 level as a result of subpar investment returns over this time period particularly the negative investment returns in the equity market in 2001 and 2002 a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets a lower discount rate environment and rising retiree medical costs particularly for prescription drugs however based on our current estimates we expect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs to decline by approximately 40 million in 2007 this decline is due primarily to improved actual investment returns and an increase in the discount rate environment in 2006 as well as the impact of the 100 million contribution we made to our us pension plans in 2006 

in the area of energy natural gas costs in 2006 remained high by historical standards but did decline slightly versus the 2005 levels in 2005 natural gas supply was disrupted by the two severe hurricanes katrina and rita which impacted the us gulf coast in the third and fourth quarters changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses each onedollar change in the price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” has a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs 

  

our 2006 natural gas costs averaged about 800 per mmbtu for the year while our 2005 costs averaged about 850 while it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we use a variety of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging we currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2007 will be lower than the first quarter of 2006 we currently have about 35 of our first quarter 2007 natural gas purchases hedged at a price of about 830 and roughly 30 of our 2007 annual requirements hedged at about 800 

  

for the past several years we have also experienced increases in the prices we pay for raw materials used in many of our businesses particularly in our coatings businesses these increases have resulted from the industrial expansion supplydemand imbalance and increases in supplier costs for oil and other inputs yearoveryear coatings raw material costs rose by 245 million in 2005 and costs advanced another 75 million in 2006 we have and plan to continue to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate and global supply sources for our raw materials reformulating our products improving our production processes and raising our selling prices 

  

the same economic factors along with high capacity utilization and industry related hurricane outages resulted in tight supplies of chloralkali products in 2005 and a large portion of 2006 this led to record ecu pricing during all of 2005 followed by another record year in 2006 first quarter 2006 ecu prices reached alltime levels for ppg and prices gradually descended each subsequent quarter 

  

separately during 2006 several chloralkali competitors in the industry announced permanent facility shutdowns which equate to approximately 4 of the north american production capacity the largest portion of these approximately 3 was completed in the fourth quarter of 2006 with the remainder scheduled for late 2007 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2006 ppg’s chloralkali volumes were curtailed due to facility shutdowns by several large customers these facility shutdowns were due in part to inventory management initiatives by customers reflecting slowing in several of their us endmarkets 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

we see a continued dynamic chloralkali environment in 2007 it is uncertain when some of these customers will return to a normal level of production which may impact the sales and earnings of our chloralkali business in early 2007 

  

ppg also supplies a variety of product into the us residential and commercial construction markets in 2006 the demand in the us residential market dropped notably as us housing starts declined 13 conversely investment in commercial construction increased by more than 15 

  

also the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change including the loss of us market share by general motors ford and daimlerchrysler this has resulted in continuation of a very challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to this industry these oems are also faced with among other things funding substantial pension and postretirement medical liabilities that place stress on their financial condition our 2006 sales in the us and canada to general motors ford and the automotive tiered suppliers whose standard  poor’s credit rating was bb or lower at dec 31 2006 totaled approximately 4 of our total global sales these sales were made under normal credit terms and we expect to collect substantially all of the amounts due from these customers at dec 31 2006 during the first quarter of 2007 however we continue to focus on the management of this credit risk 

  

in 2006 we continued work on a major business process redesign project in our european coatings businesses that has the objectives of improving our competitiveness supporting our initiatives to grow the business and increasing our margins the project will standardize our business processes throughout the region on a common it application platform in a newly defined business model that includes a new european headquarters established in switzerland we reached the first key milestone in this project in 2006 as we moved our european refinish business to the new business model over the first half of 2006 the net cost savings in 2006 were not significant but will increase as project activities continue through 2008 as we move our other european coatings businesses to this new model in 2007 and 2008 

  

we completed a series of acquisitions in 2006 that are intended to strengthen our coatings and optical products businesses by broadening their product offerings and geographic breadth sales increased in 2006 by 379 million due to acquisitions and the acquired businesses were slightly accretive to earnings in 2006 we expect sales in 2007 from these acquisitions to be 700 million to 800 million with meaningful earnings growth 

  

while we anticipate some ongoing challenges entering 2007 due to continued softness in a few us customer markets we anticipate that solid global economic conditions will remain we expect to continue capitalizing on this environment with organic growth especially in emerging regions and remain committed to continuing our consistent track record of cash generation for the ongoing benefit of our shareholders 

  

accounting standards adopted in 2006 

note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k details the impact of the company’s adoption of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” 

  

accounting standards to be adopted in future years 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin no 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after dec 15 2006 we are in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of this interpretation will have on ppg we currently expect that we will reduce our tax contingency reserve by an amount that will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this standard only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities it does not increase the use of fair value measurement sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after nov 15 2007 the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement however we do not expect it to have an effect on ppg’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

  

performance in 2005 compared with 2004 

  

performance overview 

our sales increased 7 to 102 billion in 2005 compared to 95 billion in 2004 sales increased 6 due to higher selling prices primarily in our commodity chemicals industrial coatings and performance and applied coatings reportable business segments and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation the impact 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

of increased volumes in our performance and applied coatings optical and specialty materials and glass reportable business segments was offset by volume declines in the commodity chemicals reportable business segment the volume decline in the commodity chemicals reportable business segment was due in part to lost sales resulting from the impact of hurricane rita as discussed below 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to 635 as compared to 631 in 2004 inflation including higher coatings raw material costs and higher energy costs in our commodity chemicals and glass reportable business segments increased our cost of sales 

  

selling general and administrative expense declined slightly as a percentage of sales to 174 despite increasing by 56 million in 2005 these costs increased primarily due to increased advertising in our optical products operating segment and higher expenses due to store expansions in our architectural coatings operating segment interest expense declined 9 million in 2005 reflecting the year over year reduction in the outstanding debt balance of 80 million 

  

other charges increased 284 million in 2005 primarily due to pretax charges of 132 million related to the marvin legal settlement net of 18 million in insurance recoveries 61 million for the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement 34 million of direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes rita and katrina 27 million for an asset impairment charge in our fine chemicals operating segment 19 million for debt refinancing costs and an increase of 12 million for environmental remediation costs 

  

net income and earnings per share – assuming dilution for 2005 were 596 million and 349 respectively compared to 683 million and 395 respectively for 2004 net income in 2005 included aftertax charges of 117 million or 68 cents a share for legal settlements net of insurance 21 million or 12 cents a share for direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 17 million or 10 cents a share related to an asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business and 12 million or 7 cents a share for debt refinancing costs the legal settlements net of insurance include aftertax charges of 80 million for the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries and 37 million for the impact of the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement net income for 2005 and 2004 included an aftertax charge of 13 million or 8 cents a share and 19 million or 11 cents a share respectively to reflect the net increase in the current value of the company’s obligation relating to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement 

  

results of reportable business segments 

  

   

sales of industrial coatings increased 103 million or 4 in 2005 sales increased 2 due to higher selling prices in our industrial and packaging coatings businesses and 2 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation volume was flat year over year as increased volume in automotive coatings was offset by lower volume in industrial and packaging coatings segment income decreased 54 million in 2005 the decrease in segment income was due to the adverse impact of inflation including raw materials costs increases of about 170 million which more than offset the benefits of higher selling prices improved sales margin mix formula cost reductions lower manufacturing costs and higher other income 

  

performance and applied coatings sales increased 190 million or 8 in 2005 sales increased 4 due to higher selling prices in all three operating segments 3 due to increased volumes as increases in our aerospace and architectural coatings businesses exceeded volume declines in automotive refinish and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation performance and applied coatings segment income increased 13 million in 2005 segment income increased due to the impact of increased sales volumes described above and higher other income which combined to offset the negative impacts of higher overhead costs to support the growth in these businesses particularly in the architectural coatings business and higher manufacturing costs the impact of higher selling prices fully offset the adverse impact of inflation including raw materials cost increases of about 75 million 

  

optical and specialty materials sales increased 62 million or 8 sales increased 8 due to higher sales volumes in our optical products and silica businesses which offset lower sales volumes in our fine chemicals business sales increased 1 due to an acquisition in our optical products business and decreased 1 due to lower pricing segment income decreased 28 million the primary factor decreasing segment income was the 27 million impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business the impact of higher sales volumes described above was offset by higher inflation including increased energy costs lower selling prices increased overhead costs in our optical products business to support growth 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

and 4 million of direct costs related to the impact of the hurricanes 

  

market conditions such as fewer new drug approvals product withdrawals excess production capacity and increasing share of generic drugs put pressure on the pharmaceutical industry and created a challenging environment for our fine chemicals business these conditions produced an operating performance in fine chemicals in 2005 that was disappointing as a result in the fourth quarter the company evaluated our fine chemicals business for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets” and determined that indicators of impairment were present for certain longlived assets at our manufacturing plant in the united states in measuring the fair value of these assets the company utilized an expected cash flow methodology to determine that the carrying value of these assets exceeded their fair value by 24 million we also wrote down the assets of a small fine chemical facility in france to their estimated net realizable value due to these developments the company recorded an asset impairment charge related to these fine chemicals assets of 27 million pretax which was included in “other charges” in the statement of income for the year ended dec 31 2005 

  

commodity chemicals sales increased 302 million or 25 sales increased 35 due to higher selling prices and decreased 10 due to lower sales volumes which were adversely impacted in the third and fourth quarters by the impact of the hurricanes segment income increased 200 million in 2005 the primary factor increasing segment income was the record high selling prices in 2005 factors decreasing segment income were higher inflation including 127 million due to increased energy and ethylene costs 29 million of direct costs related to the impact of the hurricanes lower sales volumes higher manufacturing costs and increased environmental remediation expense the hurricanes hit the gulf coast in september impacting volumes and costs in september through november and contributing to the rise in natural gas prices which lowered fourth quarter commodity chemicals earnings by 54 million almost 58 of the full year impact of higher natural gas prices 

  

the damage caused by hurricane rita resulted in the shutdown of our lake charles la chemicals plant for a total of eight days in september and an additional five days in october on sept 26 2005 following hurricane rita ppg declared force majeure for products produced at the lake charles facility on oct 6 2005 the facility resumed production at reduced operating rates and returned to full production capability in midnovember ppg recorded a pretax charge in the amount of 34 million in 2005 for direct costs primarily related to hurricane damage to the lake charles facility this charge is included in “other charges” in the statement of income under item 8 of this form 10k for the year ended dec 31 2005 the company also estimates that pretax earnings were reduced by approximately 27 million in 2005 due to lower sales volumes resulting from hurricane rita the company was engaged in discussions in early 2006 with its insurance providers that resulted in insurance recoveries in the third quarter of 2006 

  

glass sales increased 31 million or 1 in 2005 sales increased 1 due to improved volumes as increases in our automotive replacement glass and services and performance glazings businesses offset volume declines in our fiber glass and automotive original equipment glass businesses the positive effects of foreign currency translation were largely offset by lower selling prices primarily in our automotive replacement glass and services and automotive original equipment businesses segment income decreased 43 million in 2005 the 49 million impact of rising natural gas costs and the absence of the 19 million gain in 2004 from the saleleaseback of precious metals combined to account for a reduction in segment income of 68 million the remaining yearoveryear increase in glass segment income of 25 million resulted primarily from improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs exceeding the adverse impact of other inflation 

  

our continuing efforts in 2005 to position the fiber glass business for future growth in profitability were adversely impacted by the rise in fourth quarter natural gas prices slightly lower yearoveryear sales lower equity earnings due to weaker pricing in the asian electronics market and the absence of the 19 million gain which occurred in 2004 stemming from the sale leaseback of precious metals despite high energy costs we expected fiber glass earnings to improve in 2006 because of price strengthening in the asian electronics market which began to occur in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased cost reduction initiatives and the positive impact resulting from the start up of our new joint venture in china this joint venture will produce high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products and take advantage of lower labor costs allowing us to refocus our us production capacity on higher margin direct process products 

  

the 2005 earnings of our north american automotive oem glass operating segment declined by 30 million compared with 2004 significant structural changes continue to occur in the north american automotive industry including the loss of us market share by general motors and ford this has created a challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to the domestic oems including our operating segment about half of the decline in earnings resulted from the impact of rising natural gas costs particularly in the fourth quarter combined with the traditional adverse impact of yearoveryear sales price reductions producing a decline in 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

earnings that exceeded our successful efforts to reduce manufacturing costs the other half of the 2005 decline was due to lower sales volumes and mix and higher new program launch costs 

  

other significant factors 

the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2005 were 12 million lower than in 2004 this decrease represents the impact of market driven growth in pension plan assets that occurred in 2004 and an increased benefit provided by the subsidy offered pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement act of 2003 the “medicare act” in 2005 offset in part by a decrease in the discount rate the majority of the company’s defined benefit plans continued to be underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation “abo” basis at dec 31 2005 the underfunded amount increased in 2005 resulting in an increase in the minimum pension liability and a decrease in shareholders’ equity through a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of 173 million aftertax this increase in the underfunded amount reflects a reduction of 40 basis points in the discount rate and the impact of a change in the mortality assumption for the us plans used to calculate the abo see note 13 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

  

in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca 2004” was signed into law among its many provisions the ajca 2004 provided a limited opportunity through 2005 to repatriate the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries at a us tax cost that could be lower than the normal tax cost on such distributions during 2005 we repatriated 114 million of dividends under the provisions of ajca 2004 resulting in income tax expense of 9 million in the absence of ajca 2004 the company estimates the tax cost to repatriate these dividends would have been 23 million higher 

  

the effective tax rate for 2005 was 298 compared to 303 for 2004 the 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of 39 on the 132 million charge for the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries the 61 million settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case the 27 million asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals operating segment the 19 million charge for debt refinancing costs and the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation related to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement as discussed in note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the effective tax rate also included tax expense of 9 million related to dividends repatriated under the ajca 2004 and tax expense of 310 on the remaining pretax earnings the 2005 effective tax rate also included the benefit of the us manufacturing deduction which was created by ajca 2004 the 2004 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of 39 on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation related to asbestos claims under the ppg settlement arrangement and tax expense of 305 on the remaining pretax earnings

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k and note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed ppg settlement arrangement for asbestos claims announced on may 14 2002 and a description of the antitrust suits against ppg related to the flat glass and automotive refinish industries as discussed in item 3 and note 14 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the ppg settlement arrangement described in note 14 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 282 million and 94 million respectively of which 65 million and 29 million respectively were classified as current liabilities pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2006 2005 and 2004 totaled 207 million 27 million and 15 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 22 million 14 million and 26 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

in addition to the amounts currently reserved the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 300 million which range has been revised since dec 31 2005 to reflect the impact of the 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

submission of a feasibility study work plan for the former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and of the draft remediation feasibility study for the calcasieu river estuary which included the pretax charge of 173 million recorded in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites which actions are more fully described in note 14 such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 

  

management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time over the 15 years prior to 2006 the pretax charges against income ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year consistent with our previous disclosure charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range as a result of our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and at the calcasieu river estuary located near our lake charles la chloralkali plant we anticipate that charges against income in 2007 will be within the prior historical range we expect cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately 65 million in 2007 and to range from 50 million to 70 million annually through 2011 it is possible however that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter these expectations see note 14 for an expanded description of certain of these environmental contingencies in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

impact of inflation 

in 2006 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material costs in our coatings businesses was offset by higher selling prices in our industrial coatings performance and applied coatings and commodity chemicals reportable segments and by reduced manufacturing costs in our glass and optical and specialty materials reportable segments 

  

in 2005 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher coatings raw material costs and higher energy costs in our glass and commodity chemicals businesses were offset by higher selling prices in our commodity chemicals and performance and applied coatings reportable segments but were not offset by the combination of higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs in our industrial coatings optical and specialty materials and glass reportable segments 

  

in 2004 the combined impact of lower overall selling prices and higher production costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material and labor costs across all our reportable segments and higher energy costs in our glass and commodity chemicals businesses was only partially offset by lower manufacturing costs 

  

we expect that the gradual decline in ecu pricing in our commodity chemicals reportable segment that began in the second quarter of 2006 will continue into 2007 we also expect pricing pressure to continue in glass in 2007 the combination of the negative impact of inflation and lower pricing is expected to exceed the productivity improvements and lower manufacturing costs for 2007 in the commodity chemicals and glass reportable segments in the remaining reportable segments the combination of higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs is expected to offset the negative impact of inflation 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

  

cash from operating activities was 1130 million  1065 million and 1018 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively capital spending was 774 million  379 million and 311 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively this spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses environmental control projects and business acquisitions which amounted to 402 million  91 million and 67 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we also assumed 80 million in debt in connection with acquisitions in 2006 capital spending excluding acquisitions is expected to be 350 to 400 million during 2007 

  

during 2007 we anticipate making acquisitions as part of our strategy for accelerating growth any acquisitions would be funded through a combination of cash on hand cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and if necessary external funding sources or the issuance of stock in jan 2007 the company acquired the architectural and industrial coatings business of renner sayerlack sa gravatai brazil 

  

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 316 million  316 million and 307 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted dividends since 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

1899 and 2006 marked the 35th consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders in jan 2007 our board of directors raised the quarterly dividend on our common stock to 50 cents from 48 cents a share over time our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately onethird of our earnings per share 

  

during 2006 the company repurchased 23 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 153 million under a previously authorized share repurchase program during 2005 the company repurchased 94 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 607 million and during 2004 the company repurchased 15 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 100 million 

  

cash contributions to our employee stock ownership plan “esop” and related expense were reduced by 18 million in 2006 by the appreciation on ppg shares purchased prior to dec 31 1992 allocated to participant accounts during 2006 we expect cash contributions to the esop and related expense to be reduced by 10 million in 2007 by the appreciation on such shares 

  

during june 2005 the company completed a debt refinancing consisting of tender offers in the united states to retire outstanding debt combined with the issuance of bonds in europe as part of this refinancing the company issued €300 million of 3875 senior notes due 2015 the “euro notes” the proceeds from the euro notes were used to repay shortterm commercial paper obligations incurred in june 2005 in connection with the purchase of 100 million of 65 notes due 2007 159 million of 705 notes due 2009 and 16 million of 6875 notes due 2012 as well as for general corporate purposes the company recorded a second quarter 2005 pretax charge of approximately 19 million 12 million aftertax or 7 cents per share for debt refinancing costs 

  

on aug 17 2006 the pension protection act of 2006 the “ppa” was signed into law changing the funding requirements for our us defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008 under current funding requirements ppg did not have to make a mandatory contribution to our us plans in 2006 and we do not expect to have a mandatory contribution to these plans in 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact that ppa will have on our funding requirements for 2008 and beyond in 2006 2005 and 2004 we made voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans of 100 million 4 million and 100 million respectively and contributions to our nonus defined benefit pension plans of 24 million 26 million and 40 million respectively some of which were required by local funding requirements we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in 2007 of approximately 37 million we expect to make a 100 million voluntary contribution to our us plans in the first quarter of 2007 and we may make additional voluntary contributions in 2007 

  

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 29 at dec 31 2006 and dec 31 2005 

  

cash from operations and the company’s debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments contributions to pension plans amounts due under the proposed ppg settlement arrangement and operating requirements including ppg’s significant contractual obligations which are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the proposed ppg settlement arrangement 

  

    

the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases natural gas coal and electricity consistent with customary industry practice 

these also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 5 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

see note 8 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

  

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company may issue up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in july 1999 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8 “debt and bank credit arrangements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

  

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable to environmental remediation to pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 12 “income taxes” and note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually see note 13 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

  

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption for 2007 is 590 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would increase 2007 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 11 million and 5 million respectively 

  

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2006 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 85 we will use the same assumption for 2007 a reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points with other assumptions held constant would increase 2007 net periodic pension expense by approximately 12 million 

  

net periodic benefit cost for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for each of the years ended dec 31 2005 and 2004 was calculated using the gam 83 mortality table a commonly used mortality table in 2006 we began to use rp 2000 a newer and more relevant mortality table to calculate net periodic benefit costs for these plans this change in the mortality assumption in 2006 increased net periodic benefit costs by approximately 13 million and 4 million for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans respectively 

  

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill was impaired as of dec 31 2006 the excess of fair value over the carrying value of our fiber glass reporting unit grew during 2006 as a result of progress made during 2006 in achieving our multiyear plan to improve profitability and cash flow 

  

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants engineers lawyers and actuaries the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

  

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

currency 

  

during 2006 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling and the australian dollar the effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by 179 million for the year ended dec 31 2006 in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2006 pretax earnings of 9 million 

  

the us dollar was weaker than the euro and the british pound sterling for most of the first eight months of 2005 when compared with currency rates of 2004 the us dollar strengthened against these currencies during the last four months of 2005 the effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar decreased consolidated net assets by 215 million for the year ended dec 31 2005 the effect of currency rate changes over the course of the year resulted in a net favorable impact on 2005 pretax earnings as compared with 2004 of 8 million 

  

during 2004 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operated most notably against the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar the effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by 180 million for the year ended dec 31 2004 in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2004 pretax earnings of 35 million 

  

research and development 

  

technological innovation has been a hallmark of our company’s success throughout its history research and development costs totaled over 3 of sales in each of the past three years representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2007 these costs include technologydriven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service as well as the costs of developing new products and processes because of our broad array of products and customers we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

  

forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets which also depends on economic and political conditions foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if ppg’s settlement agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

  

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg’s stock price the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 10 “derivative financial instruments and hedge activities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis 

  

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage our exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position 

  

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2006 and 2005 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 were assets of 2 million and 1 million respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies for the years ended dec 31 2006 and 2005 would have been 2 million and 1 million respectively 

  

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt of 472 million as of dec 31 2006 and 433 million as of dec 31 2005 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 63 million and 50 million as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of 7 million as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by  2 million and 3 million as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately 2 million as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately  51 million and 53 million as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

  

the fair value of natural gas contracts in place as of dec 31 2006 was a liability of 25 million the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of dec 31 2005 was an asset of 03 million these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to higher prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 of approximately  23 million and 3 million respectively 

  

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 10 and note 14 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of dec 31 2006 and 2005 was an asset of  14 million and 10 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by 6 million and 5 million respectively as of dec 31 2006 and 2005

ppg is a major producer and marketer of chloralkali chemicals and a supplier of specialty chemicals the primary chloralkali products are chlorine caustic soda vinyl chloride monomer chlorinated solvents chlorinated benzenes calcium hypochlorite and phosgene derivatives most of these products are sold directly to manufacturing companies in the chemical processing rubber and plastics paper minerals metals and water treatment industries the primary products of ppg’s specialty chemicals businesses are transitions ® lenses optical materials amorphous precipitated silicas for tire battery separator and other enduse markets and teslin ® synthetic printing sheet used in such applications as waterproof labels epassports and identification cards and advanced intermediates and bulk active ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry transitions ® lenses are manufactured and distributed by ppg’s 51owned joint venture with essilor international 

ppg competes with six other major producers of chloralkali products price product availability product quality and customer service are the key competitive factors in the specialty chemicals area ppg’s market share varies greatly by business product quality and performance and technical service are the most critical competitive factors 

the chemicals businesses operate production facilities around the world including six plants in the united states and one each in canada and mexico the two largest facilities located in lake charles la and natrium w va primarily produce chloralkali products outside north america ppg operates one plant each in australia brazil france ireland the netherlands taiwan thailand and the philippines ppg owns equity interests in operations in the united states the average number of persons employed by the chemicals segment during 2005 was 4200 

  

raw materials and energy 

the effective management of raw materials and energy is important to ppg’s continued success prices of many of our raw materials energy and transportation rose in 2005 and we expect this trend to continue at a slower rate in 2006 in addition the growth of global industrial production particularly in china and the united states and a slowing in the rate at which our suppliers have added production capacity in north america have resulted not only in upward pressure on price but also increased the importance of managing our supply chain 

the company’s most significant raw materials are titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings segment and sand soda ash and polyvinyl butyral in the glass segment energy is a significant production cost in the chemicals and glass segments most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources and the company has made and plans to continue to make supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible in addition we have initiatives underway to evaluate the reformulation of certain of our 

  

12    2005 ppg annual report and form 10k 

products as part of a product renewal and global sourcing strategy to evaluate alternative sources of supply and alternative materials 

on nov 17 2005 the european parliament completed its first reading of a proposed new european union regulatory framework for chemicals known as “reach” the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals once enacted reach will apply to all existing and new chemical substances produced in or imported into the european union in quantities greater than one metric ton a year reach is expected to come into effect in 2007 as currently envisaged the legislation allows for a multiyear phased implementation it is expected that reach will result in incremental costs to ppg and other companies relating to the registration and testing of chemicals sold in and imported into europe also it is expected that suppliers of covered chemicals will incur registration costs and that use of some chemicals may be regulated or restricted at this time it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of reach on ppg’s businesses ppg will continue to monitor the development of the proposed legislation and assess its potential impact 

research and development 

research and development costs including depreciation of research facilities during 2005 2004 and 2003 were 325 million  321 million and 306 million respectively ppg owns and operates several research and development facilities to conduct research and development involving new and improved products and processes additional process and product research and development work is also undertaken at many of the company’s manufacturing plants as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our costs effectively we have opened a laboratory in china entered into an outsourcing arrangement with a laboratory in the ukraine and have been actively pursuing government funding of a small but growing portion of our research efforts 

  

patents 

ppg considers patent protection to be important the company’s business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents ppg received 38 million in 2005  40 million in 2004 and 29 million in 2003 from royalties and the sale of technical knowhow 

  

backlog 

in general ppg does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders 

  

nonus operations 

ppg has a significant investment in nonus operations and as a result we are subject to certain inherent risks including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while approximately 90 of sales and operating income is generated by products sold in the united states canada and western europe our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions such as asia eastern europe and south america 

  

employee relations 

the average number of persons employed worldwide by ppg during 2005 was 30800 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world and believes it will be able to renegotiate all such agreements on satisfactory terms the company believes it has good relationships with its employees 

  

environmental matters 

like other companies ppg is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 18 million  11 million and 9 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2006 will approximate  25 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and costly 

additionally about 20 of our chloralkali production capacity currently utilizes mercury cell technology these cells are operated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and are reviewed at least annually by state authorities the us environmental protection agency “usepa” has issued new regulations imposing significantly more stringent requirements on mercury emissions these new rules are scheduled to take effect in december 2006 in order to meet the usepa’s new air quality standards in july 2005 a decision was made to replace the existing mercury cell production unit at our lake charles la chemicals plant with newer membrane cell technology the louisiana department of environmental quality has granted a one year extension to meet the new requirements on mercury emissions this capital project began this year and will continue through mid2007 we do not expect the project to materially increase ppg’s total capital spending over this three year period 

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 95 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 22 sites on the national priority list the number of sites is comparable with the prior year while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods 

  

13    2005 ppg annual report and form 10k 

that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 94 million and  81 million respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2005 2004 and 2003 totaled 27 million  15 million and 21 million respectively cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 14 million 26 million and 16 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time over the past 15 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year we currently expect that charges against income for environmental remediation in 2006 will be within that range however it is possible that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors particularly as the work at a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and at the calcasieu river estuary continues to progress could alter this expectation and result in higher charges in 2006 in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to product liability contract patent environmental antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s business to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

the company has been named as a defendant along with various other codefendants in a number of antitrust lawsuits filed in federal and state courts these suits allege that ppg acted with competitors to fix prices and allocate markets in the flat glass and automotive refinish industries the plaintiffs in these cases are seeking economic and in certain cases treble damages and injunctive relief 

twentynine glass antitrust cases were filed in federal courts all of which have been consolidated as a class action in the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania located in pittsburgh pa all of the other defendants in the glass class action antitrust case previously settled with the plaintiffs and were dismissed from the case on may 29 2003 the court granted ppg’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the claims against ppg in the glass class action antitrust case the plaintiffs in that case appealed that order to the us third circuit court of appeals on sept 30 2004 the us third circuit court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the dismissal of ppg and remanded the case for further proceedings ppg petitioned the us supreme court for permission to appeal the decision of the us third circuit court of appeals however the us supreme court rejected ppg’s petition for review 

on oct 19 2005 ppg entered into a settlement agreement to settle the federal glass class action antitrust case in order to avoid the ongoing expense of this protracted case as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with complex litigation involving jury trials pursuant to the settlement agreement ppg agreed to pay 60 million and to bear up to 500000 in settlement administration costs the us district court entered an order on feb 7 2006 approving the settlement this order is subject to a thirty day appeal period if no appeals are filed the settlement will become effective at the expiration of the appeal period ppg has deposited 60 million in an escrow account as of dec 31 2005 pending the settlement becoming effective as a result of the settlement ppg will also pay 900000 pursuant to a preexisting contractual obligation to a plaintiff that is not participating in the federal glass class action antitrust case finally independent state court cases remain pending in california and tennessee involving claims that are not included in the settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case notwithstanding that ppg has agreed to settle the federal glass class action antitrust case ppg’s management remains steadfast in its belief that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the company and also believes that ppg has meritorious defenses to the independent state court cases 

approximately 60 cases alleging antitrust violations in the automotive refinish industry have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions the plaintiffs in these cases have not yet specified an amount of alleged damages the approximately 55 federal cases have been

consolidated as a class action in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania located in philadelphia pa certain of the defendants in the federal automotive refinish case have settled this case is still at an early stage and discovery is continuing with the remaining defendants the automotive refinish cases in state courts have either been stayed pending resolution of the federal proceedings or have been dismissed neither ppg’s investigation conducted through its counsel of the allegations in these cases nor the discovery conducted to date has identified a basis for the plaintiffs’ allegations that ppg participated in a pricefixing conspiracy in the us automotive refinish industry ppg’s management continues to believe that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the company and also believes it has meritorious defenses in these automotive refinish antitrust cases as discovery in the federal class action antitrust case is ongoing we will continue to evaluate any additional information that becomes available in developing our conclusion on the outcome of this contingent liability while currently not expected if future developments in the case are adverse to the company we could consider a settlement of the automotive refinish antitrust case we have no present intention of settling any of the automotive refinish antitrust cases 

for over thirty years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed ppg settlement arrangement announced may 14 2002 see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

over the past several years the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases 

a notice of violation “nov” and notice of intent to issue a further nov have been received from the state of north carolina department of environment and natural resources by ppg’s shelby north carolina fiber glass plant the novs related to noncompliant stack air emissions tests in 2005 conducted under the requirements of the clean air act title v regulations in ppg’s experience matters such as these often can be resolved with penalty amounts below 100000 however ppg cannot predict the amount if any of any civil penalty that may be assessed for either of these matters

performance in 2005 compared with 2004 

  

performance overview 

  

our sales increased 7 to 102 billion in 2005 compared to 95 billion in 2004 sales increased 6 due to higher selling prices primarily in our chemicals and coatings segments and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation the impact of increased volumes in our coatings and glass segments was offset by volume declines in the chemicals segment the volume decline in the chemicals segment was due in part to lost sales resulting from the impact of hurricane rita as discussed below 

gross profit increased 214 million due to higher sales the gross profit percentage decreased slightly to 365 for 2005 compared to 369 in 2004 inflation including higher raw material costs primarily in our coatings segment and higher energy costs in our chemicals and glass segments decreased our gross profit the benefits realized from increased selling prices along with improved manufacturing efficiencies primarily in our coatings and glass segments were all factors which increased our gross profit 

selling general and administrative expense declined slightly as a percentage of sales to 174 despite increasing by 56 million in 2005 these costs increased primarily due to increased advertising in our optical products business and higher expenses due to store expansions in our architectural finishes business interest expense declined 9 million in 2005 reflecting the year over year reduction in the outstanding debt balance of 80 million 

other charges increased 284 million in 2005 primarily due to pretax charges of 132 million related to the marvin legal settlement net of 18 million in insurance recoveries 61 million for the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement 34 million of direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes rita and katrina 27 million for an asset impairment charge in our fine chemicals business 19 million for debt refinancing costs and an increase of 12 million for environmental remediation costs 

net income and earnings per share – assuming dilution for 2005 were 596 million and 349 respectively compared to 683 million and 395 respectively for 2004 net income in 2005 included aftertax charges of 117 million or 68 cents a share for legal settlements net of insurance 21 million or 12 cents a share for direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 17 million or 10 cents a share related to an asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business and 12 million or 7 cents a share for debt refinancing costs the legal settlements net of insurance include aftertax charges of 80 million for the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries and 37 million for the impact of the federal glass class

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

action antitrust legal settlement net income for 2005 and 2004 included an aftertax charge of 13 million or 8 cents a share and 19 million or 11 cents a share respectively to reflect the net increase in the current value of the company’s obligation under the ppg settlement arrangement relating to asbestos claims 

  

results of business segments 

 coatings sales increased 291 million or 5 in 2005 sales increased 3 due to higher selling prices across all businesses except automotive 1 due to improved volumes as increases in our aerospace architectural and original equipment automotive businesses offset volume declines in automotive refinish and industrial coatings and 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation operating income decreased 168 million in 2005 the adverse impact of inflation totaled 315 million of which 245 million was attributable to higher raw material costs higher yearoveryear selling prices increased operating earnings by 169 million coatings operating earnings were reduced by the 132 million charge for the cost of the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries other factors increasing coatings operating income in 2005 were the increased sales volumes described above manufacturing efficiencies formula cost reductions and higher other income 

glass sales increased 33 million or 1 in 2005 sales increased 1 due to improved volumes as increases in our automotive replacement glass insurance and services and performance glazings flat glass businesses offset volume declines in our fiber glass and automotive original equipment glass businesses the positive effects of foreign currency translation were largely offset by lower selling prices primarily in our automotive replacement glass and automotive original equipment businesses operating income decreased 113 million in 2005 the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement of 61 million the 49 million impact of rising natural gas costs and the absence of the 19 million gain in 2004 from the saleleaseback of precious metal combined to account for a reduction in operating earnings of 129 million the remaining yearoveryear increase in glass operating earnings of 16 million resulted primarily from improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs exceeding the adverse impact of other inflation 

our continuing efforts in 2005 to position the fiber glass business for future growth in profitability were adversely impacted by the rise in fourth quarter natural gas prices slightly lower yearoveryear sales lower equity earnings due to weaker pricing in the asian electronics market and the absence of the 19 million gain which occurred in 2004 stemming from the sale leaseback of precious metals despite high energy costs we expect fiber glass earnings to improve in 2006 because of price strengthening in the asian electronics market which began to occur in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased cost reduction initiatives and the positive impact resulting from the start up of our new joint venture in china this joint venture will produce high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products and take advantage of lower labor costs allowing us to refocus our us production capacity on higher margin direct process products 

the 2005 operating earnings of our north american automotive oem glass business declined by 30 million compared with 2004 significant structural changes continue to occur in the north american automotive industry including the loss of us market share by general motors and ford this has created a very challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to the domestic oems including our business about half of the decline in earnings resulted from the impact of rising natural gas costs particularly in the fourth quarter combined with the traditional adverse impact of yearoveryear sales price reductions producing a decline in earnings that exceeded our successful efforts to reduce manufacturing costs the other half of the 2005 decline was due to lower sales volumes and mix and higher new program launch costs the challenging competitive environment and high energy prices will continue in 2006 our business is working in 2006 to improve its performance through increased manufacturing efficiencies structural cost reduction initiatives focusing on profitable growth opportunities and improving our sales mix 

chemicals sales increased 364 million or 18 in 2005 sales increased 21 due to higher selling prices primarily for chloralkali products and 1 due to the combination of an acquisition in our optical products business and the positive effects of foreign currency translation total volumes declined 4 as volume increases in optical products were more than offset by volume declines in chloralkali and fine chemicals volume in chloralkali products and silicas were adversely impacted in the third and fourth quarters by the hurricanes operating income increased 160 million in 2005 the primary factor increasing operating income was the record high selling prices in chloralkali factors decreasing operating income were higher inflation including 136 million due to increased energy and ethylene costs 34 million of direct costs related to the impact of the hurricanes 27 million due to the asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business lower sales volumes higher manufacturing costs and increased environmental expenses the increase in chemicals operating earnings occurred primarily through the first eight months of 2005 the hurricanes hit in september impacting volumes and costs in september through november and contributing to the rise in natural gas prices which lowered fourth quarter chemicals earnings by 58 million almost 57 of the full year impact of higher natural gas prices 

the damage caused by hurricane rita resulted in the shutdown of our lake charles la chemical plant for a total of eight days in september and an additional five

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

days in october on sept 26 2005 following hurricane rita ppg declared force majeure for products produced at the lake charles facility on oct 6 2005 the facility resumed production at reduced operating rates and returned to full production capability in midnovember ppg has recorded a pretax charge in the amount of 34 million in 2005 for direct costs primarily related to hurricane damage to the lake charles facility this charge is included in “other charges” in the statement of income under item 8 of this form 10k the company also estimates that pretax earnings were reduced by approximately 27 million in 2005 due to lower sales volumes resulting from hurricane rita the company is engaged in discussions with its insurance providers and is in the process of evaluating whether these losses will result in insurance recoveries 

market conditions such as fewer new drug approvals product withdrawals excess production capacity and increasing share of generic drugs have continued to put pressure on the pharmaceutical industry and have created a challenging environment for our fine chemicals business which is included in our chemicals segment these conditions have produced an operating performance in our fine chemicals business in 2005 that has been disappointing as a result in the fourth quarter the company evaluated our fine chemicals business for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets” and determined that indicators of impairment were present for certain longlived assets at our manufacturing plant in the united states in measuring the fair value of these assets the company utilized an expected cash flow methodology to determine that the carrying value of these assets exceeded their fair value by 24 million we have also decided to sell a small fine chemical facility in france and have written the related assets down to their estimated net realizable value due to these developments the company has recorded an asset impairment charge related to these fine chemicals assets of 27 million pretax which is included in “other charges” in the statement of income 

  

other significant factors 

the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2005 were 12 million lower than in 2004 this decrease represents the impact of market driven growth in pension plan assets that occurred in 2004 and an increased benefit provided by the subsidy offered pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement act of 2003 the “medicare act” in 2005 offset in part by a decrease in the discount rate the majority of the company’s defined benefit plans continued to be underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation “abo” basis at dec 31 2005 the underfunded amount increased in 2005 resulting in an increase in the minimum pension liability and a decrease in shareholders’ equity through a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of 173 million aftertax this increase in the underfunded amount reflects a reduction of 40 basis points in the discount rate and the impact of a change in the mortality assumption for the us plans used to calculate the abo see note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca 2004” was signed into law among its many provisions the ajca 2004 provided a limited opportunity through 2005 to repatriate the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries at a us tax cost that could be lower than the normal tax cost on such distributions during 2005 we repatriated 114 million of dividends under the provisions of ajca 2004 resulting in income tax expense of 9 million in the absence of ajca 2004 the company estimates the tax cost to repatriate these dividends would have been 23 million higher 

the effective tax rate for 2005 was 298 compared to 303 for the 2004 the 2005 rate is comprised of a tax benefit of 39 on the 132 million charge for the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries the 61 million settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case the 27 million asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business the 19 million charge for debt refinancing costs and the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation related to asbestos litigation under the ppg settlement arrangement as discussed in note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the effective tax rate also includes tax expense of 9 million related to dividends repatriated under the ajca 2004 and tax expense of 310 on the remaining pretax earnings the 2005 effective rate also includes the benefit of the us manufacturing deduction which was created by ajca 2004 the 2004 rate is comprised of a tax benefit of 39 on the adjustment to increase the current value of the company’s obligation related to asbestos litigation under the ppg settlement arrangement and tax expense of 305 on the remaining pretax earnings our current estimate of the effective tax rate for 2006 is 315 

  

outlook 

in 2005 growth in the us economy moderated throughout the year due in part to rising interest rates and higher energy fuel and other raw material costs industrial production which grew at a rate of about 4 in the beginning of the year slowed in the second half of the year resulting in a full year growth rate of approximately 3 industrial production remains the economic metric that most positively correlates with our volume growth because it reflects activity in ppg’s broad enduse markets the commercial construction sector grew at a rate of 2 for the entire year but showed signs of further improvement during the second half of the year housing starts in the us were strong all year for the full year north american production of light vehicles was flat with 2004 while european automotive production was slightly down inflation remained at low levels overall and the us equity markets ended the year flat 

the european economy grew in 2005 at a rate of just under 2 but industrial production in europe grew only 05 for the year western european light vehicle production was down slightly yearoveryear

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

growth in asia was stronger in 2005 than in other parts of the world with gdp industrial production and light vehicle production posting gains in the range of 69 

entering 2006 most economists predict continued north american growth but at a slower pace once again inflation is expected to remain relatively low despite historically high energy costs and raw material prices this anticipated low level of inflation is due to the impact of increased globalization and productivity interest rates are expected to peak this year with some economists predicting a decline later in the year 

worldwide economic growth is expected to continue in 2006 with all four of the major economies expanding the western european economy began to show some positive signs at the end of 2005 and that will likely carry forward into early 2006 at low but positive levels growth in eastern europe is expected to continue 

in japan several economic indicators show that the economic environment has rebounded into positive territory for the first time in several years meanwhile the emerging asian economies are expected to continue to post high growth rates especially in both china and india china’s infrastructure growth is expected to continue to impact the overall global economy via increased demand for basic goods and commodities additionally china and other low production cost countries will continue to put downward pressure on worldwide pricing of consumer goods as has been our experience the past few years we expect china’s expansion to benefit demand for our coatings fiber glass and optical businesses while requiring our glass and commodity chemicals businesses to continue their ongoing focus on reducing costs 

in 2006 we will continue our commitment to our heritage values of serving our customers introducing new technologies and achieving operational excellence through our continuing focus on reducing costs the outlook for the global economic environment should support our efforts to deliver sales growth in 2006 throughout our businesses we also expect to face continued cost pressures in 2006 from pensions healthcare natural gas and raw materials 

the cost pressures that we face in 2006 mean that we will supplement our ongoing initiatives to lower our manufacturing and overhead costs through continuous improvement with additional actions to reduce our workforce and consolidate facilities we are in the process of finalizing our plans and expect to record pretax charges in the first quarter 2006 in the range of 50 million to 70 million 

our pension and post retirement benefit costs totaled 234 million in 2005 reflecting a decline of 12 million from 2004 however these costs remain well above their 2000 level as a result of subpar investment returns over this time period particularly the negative investment returns in the equity market in 2001 and 2002 a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets a lower discount rate environment and rising retiree medical costs particularly for prescription drugs based on our current estimates our pension and other postretirement benefits costs are expected to rise in 2006 by 40 million 

alltime high natural gas costs in north america were detrimental to our 2005 earnings and these costs rose abruptly following the severe hurricanes that impacted the us gulf coast in the third quarter changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments each onedollar change in the price of natural gas per million british thermal units “mmbtu” would have a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices which continue to be high and volatile as we begin 2006 in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we use a number of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging we currently estimate our average cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2006 will be at about 1000 per mmbtu or 350 per mmbtu higher than the first quarter of 2005 this represents an increase of over 50 yearoveryear 

beginning in the second half of 2004 and continuing throughout 2005 we have experienced increases in the prices we pay for raw materials used in many of our businesses particularly in our coatings businesses these increases have resulted from the industrial expansion supplydemand imbalance and increases in supplier costs for oil and other inputs yearoveryear coatings raw material costs rose by 245 million in 2005 and while the pace has slowed we expect to see a further yearoveryear increase in 2006 we plan to continue to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate and global supply sources for our raw materials reformulating our products improving our production processes and raising our selling prices 

these same factors along with high capacity utilization and industry related hurricane outages resulted in tight supplies of chloralkali products this led to record ecu pricing during all of 2005 with increases recognized throughout the year ecu prices in the fourth quarter 2005 were up 35 versus the fourth quarter of 2004 we expect these market conditions to continue as we enter 2006 but they may moderate at some point during the year 

significant structural changes continue to occur in the north american automotive industry including the loss of us market share by general motors and ford this has created a very challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to this industry these oems are also faced with funding substantial pension and postretirement medical liabilities that place stress on their financial condition our 2005 sales in the us and canada to general motors ford and the automotive tiered suppliers whose standard  poor’s credit rating was bb or lower at dec 31 2005 totaled approximately 5 of our total global sales these sales were made under normal credit terms and we expect to collect substantially all of the amounts due from these customers at dec 31

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

2005 during the first quarter of 2006 however we have increased our focus on the management of this credit risk 

we have been working for the past year on a major business process redesign project in our european coatings business with the objectives of improving our competitiveness supporting our initiatives to grow the business and increasing our margins the project will standardize our business processes throughout the region on a common it application platform in a newly defined business model that includes establishing a new european headquarters in switzerland we will reach the first key milestone in this project as we move our european refinish business to the new business model over the first half of 2006 the net cost savings in 2006 will not be significant but will increase as project activities continue through 2008 

a sharp focus on our capital spending and working capital has enabled us to continue along our track of strong cash generation as evidenced by the 5 billion in cash generated from operating activities over the 20012005 time period we have continued to fund our portfolio of businesses and prudently manage capital spending while at the same time continuing our trend of increasing dividend payments to shareholders for 34 consecutive years and reducing our debt by 17 billion over the past five years additionally we repurchased 100 million of ppg common stock in 2004 and completed another 600 million in purchases of ppg common stock in 2005 

we remain confident that ppg is well positioned to benefit from the expected worldwide economic growth in 2006 

  

accounting standard adopted in 2005 

in march 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” fin no 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” and provides further guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 

effective dec 31 2005 ppg adopted the provisions of fin no 47 our only conditional asset retirement obligation relates to the possible future abatement of asbestos contained in certain ppg production facilities the asbestos in our production facilities arises from the application of normal and customary building practices in the past when the facilities were constructed this asbestos is encapsulated in place and as a result there is no current legal requirement to abate it inasmuch as there is no requirement to abate we do not have any current plans or an intention to abate and therefore the timing method and cost of the future abatement if any are not known in accordance with the provisions of fin no 47 the company has not recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with asbestos abatement given the uncertainty concerning the timing of future abatement if any 

the adoption of fin no 47 on dec 31 2005 did not result in any impact to our results of operations or financial position for the year ended dec 31 2005 and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the company’s future results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  

accounting standards to be adopted in future years 

in november 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas no 151 requires the exclusion of certain costs from inventories and the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventories to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of this statement are effective for costs incurred after dec 31 2005 we have evaluated the effect the adoption of this standard will have on ppg and we do not expect it to have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

in december 2004 the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 123 “sharebased payments” which now requires that stock options be expensed based on their fair value in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission announced that the effective date of the revised sfas no 123 was delayed to years beginning after june 15 2005 as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k ppg began expensing stock options effective jan 1 2004 and consequently our adoption of this revised statement in 2006 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

  

performance in 2004 compared with 2003 

overall performance 

our sales increased 9 to 95 billion in 2004 from 88 billion in 2003 sales increased 7 due to improved volumes across all of our business segments and 3 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations these sales increases were offset by a 1 decline due to lower selling prices 

gross profit increased 279 million while the gross profit percentage remained steady at 369 in 2004 and 2003 the sales volume increase favorable impact of currency improved manufacturing efficiencies higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and lower pension and other postretirement benefit costs across all of our business segments increased our gross profit lower selling prices in our glass and coatings segments and higher natural gas energy raw material and labor costs lowered our gross profit 

selling general and administrative expense depreciation and research and development costs declined slightly as a percentage of sales to 25 despite increasing 142 million in 2004 these costs increased in part to support sales volume growth in 2004 and also because of the impact of foreign currency inflation and our decision to begin expensing stock options in 2004 

  

21    2005 ppg annual report and form 10k 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

interest expense was 17 million less in 2004 than in 2003 reflecting the year over year reduction in debt of 316 million other charges declined 30 million in 2004 due to a combination of lower environmental remediation legal and workers compensation expenses and the absence of certain 2003 charges other earnings were 28 million higher in 2004 due primarily to higher earnings from our equity affiliates 

the effective tax rate for 2004 was 3029 compared to 3476 for the full year 2003 the reduction in the rate for 2004 reflects the benefit of the subsidy offered pursuant to the medicare act not being subject to tax the continued improvement in the geographical mix of nonus earnings and the favorable resolution during 2004 of matters related to two open us federal income tax years 

net income in 2004 totaled 683 million an increase of 189 million over 2003 and earnings per share – diluted increased 106 to 395 per share 

  

results of business segments 

  

  coatings sales increased 440 million or 9 in 2004 sales increased 6 from improved volumes across all our coatings businesses and 4 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations sales declined 1 due to lower selling prices principally in our automotive business operating income increased 58 million in 2004 factors increasing operating income were the higher sales volume 135 million and the favorable effects of currency translation described above and improved manufacturing efficiencies of 20 million factors decreasing operating income were inflationary cost increases of 82 million and lower selling prices 

glass sales increased 54 million or 3 in 2004 sales increased 6 from improved volumes primarily from our performance glazings flat glass fiber glass and automotive original equipment businesses net of lower volumes in our automotive replacement glass business sales also increased 2 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european fiber glass operations sales declined 5 due to lower selling prices across all our glass businesses operating income in 2004 increased 98 million factors increasing operating income were improved manufacturing efficiencies of 110 million higher sales volume 53 million described above higher equity earnings and the gains on the saleleaseback of precious metals of 19 million the principal factor decreasing operating income was lower selling prices fiber glass volumes were up 15 for the year although pricing declined with the shift of electronic printed wiring board production to asia and the volume and pricing gains there equity earnings from our joint venture serving that region grew in 2004 these factors combined with focused cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies to improve the operating performance of this business as we continue to position it for future growth in profitability 

chemicals sales increased 263 million or 15 in 2004 sales increased 10 from improved volumes in our commodity and specialty businesses and 4 due to higher selling prices for our commodity products sales also increased 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations operating income increased 63 million in 2004 factors increasing operating income were the higher selling prices for our commodity products and the higher sales volume 73 million described above improved manufacturing efficiencies of 25 million and lower environmental expenses factors decreasing 2004 operating income were inflationary cost increases of 40 million and higher energy costs of 79 million 

  

other significant factors 

the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2004 were 45 million lower than in 2003 this decrease reflects the market driven growth in pension plan assets that occurred in 2003 the impact of the 140 million in cash contributed to the pension plans by the company in 2004 and the benefit of the subsidy offered pursuant to the medicare act as discussed in note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for a description of certain of these lawsuits including a description of the proposed ppg settlement arrangement for asbestos claims announced on may 14 2002 as discussed in item 3 and note 13 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the ppg settlement arrangement described in note 13 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

the company has been named as a defendant along with various other codefendants in a number of antitrust lawsuits filed in federal and state courts these suits allege that ppg acted with competitors to fix prices and allocate markets in the flat glass and automotive refinish industries

the plaintiffs in these cases are seeking economic and in certain cases treble damages and injunctive relief 

twentynine glass antitrust cases were filed in federal courts all of which have been consolidated as a class action in the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania located in pittsburgh pa all of the other defendants in the glass class action antitrust case previously settled with the plaintiffs and were dismissed from the case on may 29 2003 the court granted ppg’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the claims against ppg in the glass class action antitrust case the plaintiffs in that case appealed that order to the us third circuit court of appeals on sept 30 2004 the us third circuit court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the dismissal of ppg and remanded the case for further proceedings ppg petitioned the us supreme court for permission to appeal the decision of the us third circuit court of appeals however the us supreme court rejected ppg’s petition for review 

on oct 19 2005 ppg entered into a settlement agreement to settle the federal glass class action antitrust case in order to avoid the ongoing expense of this protracted case as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with complex litigation involving jury trials pursuant to the settlement agreement ppg agreed to pay 60 million and to bear up to 500000 in settlement administration costs the us district court entered an order on feb 7 2006 approving the settlement this order is subject to a thirty day appeal period if no appeals are filed the settlement will become effective at the expiration of the appeal period ppg has deposited 60 million in an escrow account as of dec 31 2005 pending the settlement becoming effective as a result of the settlement ppg will also pay 900000 pursuant to a preexisting contractual obligation to a plaintiff that is not participating in the federal glass class action antitrust case finally independent state court cases remain pending in california and tennessee involving claims that are not included in the settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case notwithstanding that ppg has agreed to settle the federal glass class action antitrust case ppg’s management remains steadfast in its belief that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the company and also believes that ppg has meritorious defenses to the independent state court cases 

approximately 60 cases alleging antitrust violations in the automotive refinish industry have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions the plaintiffs in these cases have not yet specified an amount of alleged damages the approximately 55 federal cases have been consolidated as a class action in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania located in philadelphia pa certain of the defendants in the federal automotive refinish case have settled this case is still at an early stage and discovery is continuing with the remaining defendants the automotive refinish cases in state courts have either been stayed pending resolution of the federal proceedings or have been dismissed neither ppg’s investigation conducted through its counsel of the allegations in these cases nor the discovery conducted to date has identified a basis for the plaintiffs’ allegations that ppg participated in a pricefixing conspiracy in the us automotive refinish industry ppg’s management continues to believe that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the company and also believes it has meritorious defenses in these automotive refinish antitrust cases as discovery in the federal class action antitrust case is ongoing we will continue to evaluate any additional information that becomes available in developing our conclusion on the outcome of this contingent liability while currently not expected if future developments in the case are adverse to the company we could consider a settlement of the automotive refinish antitrust case we have no present intention of settling any of the automotive refinish antitrust cases 

the company had been a defendant since april 1994 in a suit filed by marvin windows and doors “marvin” alleging numerous claims including breach of warranty all of the plaintiff’s claims other than breach of warranty were dismissed however on feb 14 2002 a federal jury awarded marvin 136 million on the remaining claim subsequently the court added 20 million for interest bringing the total judgment to 156 million ppg appealed that judgment and the appeals court heard the parties’ arguments on june 9 2003 on march 23 2005 the appeals court ruled against ppg subsequent to the ruling by the court ppg and marvin agreed to settle this matter for 150 million and ppg recorded a charge for that amount in the first quarter of 2005 which is included in “other charges” in the statement of income under item 8 of this form 10k ppg paid the settlement on april 28 2005 in the third quarter of 2005 ppg received 18 million in insurance recoveries related to this settlement the amount is included in “other charges” for the year ended dec 31 2005 the company continues to pursue additional insurance recoveries related to this matter but is unable to estimate the likelihood or amount of any future recoveries 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling  94 million and 81 million respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2005 2004 and 2003 totaled 27 million  15 million and 21 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 14 million  26 million and 16 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

in addition to the amounts currently reserved the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million which range is unchanged from the prior year end such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of 

  

23    2005 ppg annual report and form 10k 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

occurrence management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time over the past 15 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year we currently expect that charges against income for environmental remediation in 2006 will be within that range however it is possible that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors particularly as the work at a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city nj and at the calcasieu river estuary continues to progress could alter this expectation and result in higher charges in 2006 see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for an expanded description of certain of these environmental contingencies in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

impact of inflation 

in 2005 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material costs in our coatings segment and higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments was more than offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our coatings and chemicals segments and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our glass and coatings segments in 2004 the combined impact of lower overall selling prices and higher production costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material and labor costs across all our segments and higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments was only partially offset through improved manufacturing efficiencies in 2003 the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments was offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments 

we anticipate that the negative impact of inflation on our costs will be less severe in 2006 than in 2005 particularly with respect to raw material costs in our coatings segment and energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments we expect the combination of continuing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and an overall increase in our selling prices in 2006 will enable us to fully recoup the negative impact of inflation other than natural gas costs due to the high volatility of natural gas prices it is difficult to predict the related 2006 costs but if the prices remain at year end 2005 levels we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

cash from operating activities was 1065 million  1018 million and 1123 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively capital spending was 379 million  311 million and 220 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses environmental control projects and business acquisitions which amounted to 91 million  67 million and 3 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively capital spending excluding acquisitions is expected to be approximately 385 million during 2006 

we have an ongoing process that includes a review of our array of businesses in relation to our overall strategic and performance objectives as part of this review we may acquire or divest of certain businesses or enter into joint ventures with other companies during 2006 we anticipate making acquisitions as part of our strategy for accelerating growth any acquisitions would be funded through a combination of cash on hand cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and to a lesser extent external funding sources or the issuance of stock 

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 316 million  307 million and 294 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899 and 2005 marked the 34th consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders over time our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately onethird of our earnings per share 

during 2005 the company repurchased 94 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 607 million under previously authorized share repurchase programs during 2004 the company repurchased 15 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 100 million and during 2003 the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock 

during june 2005 the company completed a debt refinancing consisting of tender offers in the united states to retire outstanding debt combined with the issuance of bonds in europe as part of this refinancing the company issued €300 million of 3875 senior notes due 2015 the “euro notes” the proceeds from the euro notes were used to repay shortterm commercial paper obligations incurred in june 2005 in connection with the purchase of 100 million of 65 notes due 2007 159 million of 705 notes due 2009 and 16 million of 6875 notes due 2012 as well as for general corporate purposes the company recorded a second quarter pre tax charge of approximately 19 million 12 million aftertax or 7 cents per share for debt refinancing costs 

while we have had no mandatory funding contribution required under pension benefit guarantee corporation or internal revenue service “irs” regulations for our us pension plans we chose to make voluntary contributions of 4 million in 2005 and 100 million in 2004 these pension contributions will allow the 

  

24    2005 ppg annual report and form 10k 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

company more flexibility in determining both the timing and amounts of future mandatory contributions under the complex erisa and irs pension funding regulations these funding regulations are expected to change as a result of pending legislation currently being considered by the us congress notwithstanding the current uncertainty concerning these requirements we do not expect to have a mandatory contribution in 2006 or 2007 however the company may elect to make voluntary contributions to its us pension plans during that time during 2005 2004 and 2003 we made contributions to our nonus pension plans totaling 26 million  40 million and 41 million respectively we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in 2006 of approximately  20 million 

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity increased to 29 at dec 31 2005 from 27 at dec 31 2004 the increase in this ratio is primarily a function of the decline of equity in 2005 which was largely caused by the repurchase of 607 million of ppg common stock 

cash from operations and the company’s debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending including acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments contributions to pension plans amounts due under the proposed ppg settlement arrangement and operating requirements including ppg’s significant contractual obligations which are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the proposed ppg settlement arrangement 

  

  the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases natural gas coal and electricity consistent with customary industry practice these also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 5 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

see note 7 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company may issue up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in july 1999 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 7 “debt and bank credit arrangements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable environmental remediation pending impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 11 “income taxes” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually see note 12 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments evaluating market interest rate indices 

  

25    2005 ppg annual report and form 10k 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

and using an outside advisor to determine the yield on a diversified portfolio of available high quality fixed income securities that matches our projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption for 2006 is 565 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would increase 2006 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 9 million and 6 million respectively 

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2005 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 85 we expect to use the same assumption for 2006 a reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points with other assumptions held constant would increase 2006 net periodic pension expense by approximately 11 million 

net periodic benefit cost for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for each of the three years ended dec 31 2005 was calculated using the gam 83 mortality table a commonly used mortality table in 2006 we will begin to use rp 2000 a newer and more relevant mortality table to calculate net periodic benefit costs for these plans we estimate this change in the mortality assumption in 2006 will increase net periodic benefit costs by approximately 13 million and 4 million for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans respectively 

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill was impaired as of dec 31 2005 however the fair value of our fiber glass business declined during 2005 as a result some or all of the related goodwill of 49 million is at risk in 2006 for impairment should our projected recovery in the business not occur 

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants engineers lawyers and actuaries the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

currency 

when compared with currency rates of the prior year on a month to month basis the us dollar was weaker than the euro and the british pound sterling for most of the first eight months of the year the us dollar strengthened against these currencies during the last four months of the year the effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar decreased consolidated net assets by 215 million for the year ended dec 31 2005 the effect of currency rate changes over the course of the year resulted in a net favorable impact on 2005 pretax earnings as compared with 2004 of approximately 8 million 

during 2004 and 2003 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar the effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by 180 million and 328 million for the years ended dec 31 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2004 and 2003 pretax earnings of approximately 35 million and 50 million respectively 

  

research and development 

innovation and technology have been a hallmark of our company’s success throughout its history research and development costs totaled over 3 of sales in each of the past three years representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2006 these costs include technologydriven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service as well as the costs of developing new products and processes because of our broad array of products and customers we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

  

26    2005 ppg annual report and form 10k 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets which also depends on economic and political conditions foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if ppg’s settlement agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition operations or liquidity 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates natural gas prices and ppg’s stock price arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce this market risk a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 9 “derivative financial instruments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage our exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s financial results cash flows and financial condition 

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2005 and 2004 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk the fair value of these contracts as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 was not material the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies would also not have been material 

ppg had nonus dollar denominated debt of 433 million as of dec 31 2005 and 44 million as of dec 31 2004 the increase in these borrowings was primarily due to the issuance of €300 million of notes in june 2005 a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 50 million and 11 million as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk the fair value of the interest rate swaps in place as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 was a liability of 7 million and an asset of 4 million respectively the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by  3 million and 9 million as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately 2 million as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately  53 million and 36 million as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 respectively however such changes would not have had an effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

the fair value of natural gas contracts in place as of dec 31 2005 was an asset of 03 million the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of dec 31 2004 was a liability of  2 million these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to rising prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 of approximately  3 million and 1 million respectively 

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 9 “derivative financial instruments” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of dec 31 2005 and 2004 was an asset of  10 million and 19 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by 5 million and 6 million respectively as of dec 31 2005 and 2004

environmental matters 

like other companies ppg is subject to the existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were  11 million 9 million and 8 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2005 will approximate  12 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and costly additionally about 20 of our chloralkali production capacity currently utilizes mercury cell technology these cells are operated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and are reviewed at least annually by state authorities the us environmental protection agency “usepa” has issued new regulations imposing significantly more stringent requirements on mercury emissions these new rules are scheduled to take effect in december 2006 in order to meet the usepa’s new air quality standards we will need to either invest in air emissions equipment or replace this capacity with newer nonmercury based technology we are evaluating our options and believe that either choice can be accomplished within the government required timeframe and within the range of ppg’s normal capital spending 

ppg is negotiating with various us government agencies concerning 91 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 22 sites on the national priority list the number of sites is comparable with the prior year while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling  81 million and 92 million respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2004 2003 and 2002 totaled  15 million 21 million and 15 million respectively 

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year we anticipate that charges against income in 2005 will be within that range it is possible however that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this expectation in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are 

  

2004 annual report and form 10k n ppg industries inc 

  

sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to product liability contract patent environmental antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s business to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

the company has been named as a defendant along with various codefendants in a number of antitrust lawsuits filed in federal and state courts these suits allege ppg acted with competitors to fix prices and allocate markets in the flat glass and automotive refinish industries 

twentynine glass antitrust cases were filed in federal courts all of which have been consolidated in the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania located in pittsburgh pa the court has ruled that the case may proceed as a class action similar state court actions are inactive pending resolution of the federal proceedings all of the initial defendants in the glass class action antitrust case other than ppg have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs on may 29 2003 the court granted ppg’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the claims against ppg in the glass class action antitrust case the plaintiffs in that case appealed that order to the us third circuit court of appeals on sept 30 2004 the us third circuit court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the dismissal of ppg and remanded the case for further proceedings ppg has since petitioned the us supreme court for permission to appeal the decision of the us third circuit court of appeals if the us supreme court rejects ppg’s petition for review the case will likely proceed to trial in 2006 

in addition approximately 60 cases alleging antitrust violations in the automotive refinish industry have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions the approximately 55 federal cases have been consolidated as a class action in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania located in philadelphia pa certain of the defendants in the federal automotive refinish case have settled this case is still at an early stage and discovery is continuing with the remaining defendants except for a case in california and a recently filed case in vermont the state automotive refinish cases have either been stayed pending resolution of the federal proceedings or have been dismissed 

the plaintiffs in these various antitrust cases are seeking economic and treble damages as well as injunctive relief ppg believes it has meritorious defenses in these antitrust lawsuits 

the company has been a defendant since april 1994 in a suit filed by marvin windows and doors “marvin” alleging numerous claims including breach of warranty all of the plaintiff’s claims other than breach of warranty were dismissed however on feb 14 2002 a federal jury awarded marvin 136 million on the remaining claim subsequently the court added 20 million for prejudgment interest bringing the total judgment to 156 million ppg has appealed that judgment the appeals court heard the parties’ arguments on june 9 2003 but has not yet rendered its decision interest will be added to the 156 million judgment against ppg during the appeals process as of dec 31 2004 the amount of the total judgment against ppg including interest was approximately  166 million ppg believes it has meritorious defenses to the plaintiff’s claims and has reasonable prospects of prevailing on appeal 

for over thirty years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed ppg settlement arrangement announced may 14 2002 see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

over the past several years the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

performance in 2004 compared with 2003 

  

overall performance 

our sales increased 9 to 95 billion in 2004 from 88 billion in 2003 sales increased 7 due to improved volumes across all of our business segments and 3 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations these sales increases were offset by a 1 decline due to lower selling prices 

gross profit increased 279 million while the gross profit percentage remained steady at 369 in 2004 and 2003 the sales volume increase favorable impact of currency improved manufacturing efficiencies higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and lower pension and other postretirement benefit costs across all of our business segments increased our gross profit lower selling prices in our glass and coatings segments and higher natural gas energy raw material and labor costs lowered our gross profit 

selling general and administrative expense depreciation and research and development costs declined slightly as a percentage of sales to 25 despite increasing 142 million in 2004 these costs increased in part to support sales volume growth in 2004 and also because of the impact of foreign currency inflation and our decision to begin expensing stock options in 2004 

interest expense was 17 million less in 2004 than in 2003 reflecting the year over year reduction in debt of 316 million other charges declined 30 million in 2004 due to a combination of lower environmental remediation legal and workers compensation expenses and the absence of certain 2003 charges other earnings were 28 million higher in 2004 due primarily to higher earnings from our equity affiliates 

the effective tax rate for 2004 was 3029 compared to 3476 for the full year 2003 the reduction in the rate for 2004 reflects the benefit of the subsidy offered pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “medicare act” not being subject to tax the continued improvement in the geographical mix of nonus earnings and the favorable resolution during 2004 of matters related to two open us federal income tax years 

net income in 2004 totaled 683 million an increase of 189 million over 2003 and earnings per share – diluted increased 106 to 395 per share 

  

results of business segments 

  

  coatings sales increased 440 million or 9 in 2004 sales increased 6 from improved volumes across all our coatings businesses and 4 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations sales declined 1 due to lower selling prices principally in our automotive business operating income increased 58 million in 2004 factors increasing operating income were the higher sales volume 135 million and the favorable effects of currency translation described above and improved manufacturing efficiencies of 20 million factors decreasing operating income were inflationary cost increases of 82 million and lower selling prices 

glass sales increased 54 million or 3 in 2004 sales increased 6 from improved volumes primarily from our flat glass fiber glass and automotive original equipment businesses net of lower volumes in our automotive replacement glass business sales also increased 2 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european fiber glass operations sales declined 5 due to lower selling prices across all our glass businesses operating income in 2004 increased 98 million factors increasing operating income were improved manufacturing efficiencies of 110 million higher sales volume 53 million described above higher equity earnings and the gains on the saleleaseback of precious metals of 19 million the principal factor decreasing operating income was lower selling prices fiber glass volumes were up 15 for the year although pricing declined with the shift of electronic printed wiring board production to asia and the volume and pricing gains there equity earnings from our joint venture serving that region grew in 2004 these factors combined with focused cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies to improve the operating performance of this business as we continue to position it for future growth in profitability

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

chemicals sales increased 263 million or 15 in 2004 sales increased 10 from improved volumes in our commodity and specialty businesses and 4 due to higher selling prices for our commodity products sales also increased 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations operating income increased 63 million in 2004 factors increasing operating income were the higher selling prices for our commodity products and the higher sales volume 73 million described above improved manufacturing efficiencies of 25 million and lower environmental expenses factors decreasing 2004 operating income were inflationary cost increases of 40 million and higher energy costs of 79 million market influences such as fewer new drug approvals and increasing share of generic drugs are putting pressure on the pharmaceutical industry resulting in a challenging environment for our fine chemicals business in the nearterm that includes significantly lower pricing 

other significant factors 

  

the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2004 were 45 million lower than in 2003 this decrease reflects the market driven growth in pension plan assets that occurred in 2003 the impact of the 140 million in cash contributed to the pension plans by the company in 2004 and the benefit of the subsidy offered pursuant to the medicare act as discussed in note 12 under item 8 of this form 10k 

in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca 2004” was signed into law among its many provisions the ajca 2004 provides a limited opportunity in 2005 to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries at a us tax cost that may be lower than the normal tax cost on such distributions we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this provision on ppg and are awaiting final guidance from the internal revenue service to complete that evaluation however our current estimate is that the tax cost of any dividends we decide to pay in 2005 will not increase our effective tax rate significantly we have included the estimated net impact of the remaining provisions of the ajca 2004 including the us manufacturing deduction in our current estimate of the effective tax rate for 2005 of 315 

outlook 

  

in 2004 the us economy continued to gain momentum from the expansion that began in late 2003 consumer confidence has been strong and has been buoyed by low interest rates employment growth and improved us equity markets that reached their highest level in nearly three years industrial production which grew at a rate of 7 at the beginning of 2004 slowed in the second half of the year but still achieved a solid 45 growth rate for the year industrial production is the economic metric that most positively correlates with our volume growth because it reflects activity in ppg’s broad enduse markets the commercial construction sector grew at a 2 rate for the year but showed signs of further improvement during the second half of the year for the full year north american sales of light vehicles were up slightly as were european automotive sales 

as the new year begins most economists expect that the us economy will continue to perform well in 2005 though growth may perhaps be at a slower pace inflation is expected to remain relatively low despite rising energy costs and raw material prices because of increasing productivity interest rates should remain at relatively low levels 

the healthy us economy should help to support overall global economic growth in 2005 global competition combined with productivity improvements will keep overall inflation in check and sustain worldwide economic growth growth in the european economy will likely be adversely impacted by the strength of the euro which at the end of 2004 was near its alltime high against the us dollar however the strengthening economy of eastern europe may be a mitigating factor 

the asian economies are expected to continue to record relatively high growth rates especially in china this growth remains strong yet tempered due to a variety of government efforts aimed at preventing the economy from overheating china’s infrastructure growth is expected to continue to impact the overall global economy via increased demand for basic goods and commodities additionally china and other low labor cost countries will continue to put downward pressure on worldwide pricing of consumer goods as was the case in 2004 we expect china’s expansion to benefit our coatings fiber glass and optical businesses while requiring our glass and commodity chemicals businesses to continue their ongoing focus on reducing costs 

in 2005 we will remain committed to our ppg blueprint values of serving our customers introducing new technologies and achieving operational excellence through our continuing focus on reducing costs the prospect of favorable global economic conditions this year lead us to expect continued sales growth in 2005 important cost issues in 2005 will continue to include pensions other postretirement benefits natural gas and raw materials 

while we have consistently focused on reducing our costs we continue to be challenged by higher costs for employee benefits particularly pensions and medical prior to 2001 our pension income more than offset other postretirement benefit costs in 2004 pension expense combined with other postretirement benefit costs were nearly 250 million this cost increase translates to over 105 per share in lower earnings in 2004 compared with 2000 this increase in costs results from a combination of the decline in the market value of the company’s pension plans assets due primarily to negative investment returns 

  

2004 annual report and form 10k n ppg industries inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

in the equity markets during 20002002 a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets lower discount rate assumption and rising retiree medical costs particularly for prescription drugs the current low interest rate environment has continued and in fact the discount rate at dec 31 2004 was approximately 25 basis points lower than at dec 31 2003 this raises the present value of future benefit obligations and expense offsetting the negative impact of lower discount rates were the strong actual return on our us plan assets of over 25 in 2003 and over 12 in 2004 additionally the benefit of the subsidy available under the medicare act reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and resulted in a reduction of our other postretirement benefit cost in 2004 of 19 million this benefit is expected to be approximately 25 million in 2005 based on current estimates including the benefit of this subsidy our pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2005 are expected to rise only slightly from the 2004 level 

high natural gas costs in north america continue to be a drag on earnings changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments each onedollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu million british thermal units would have a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs it is difficult to predict future natural gas prices which continue to be high and volatile in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we use a number of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging we currently estimate our average cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2005 will be approximately 630 per mmbtu including the impact of hedges we have in place on approximately onethird of our expected first quarter natural gas consumption this estimate represents an increase of 12 over our first quarter 2004 cost of natural gas 

in the second half of 2004 we began to see increases in the prices for raw materials used in our coatings businesses as a result of the industrial expansion supplydemand imbalance and increases in supplier costs for oil and other inputs yearoveryear coatings raw material costs will rise at least 50 million in the first quarter of 2005 and are likely to continue to be higher for the remainder of 2005 we plan to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate supply sources reformulating our products improving our production processes and yields and raising our selling prices 

these same factors along with high capacity utilization resulted in tighter supplies of chloralkali products this led to a sharp increase in ecu prices in the second half of 2004 which benefited our commodity chemicals business ecu prices in the fourth quarter 2004 were up 31 versus the fourth quarter of 2003 we expect these tight supplydemand conditions in the market to continue at least through the first half of 2005 

our focus on our blueprint values has enabled us to continue along our track of strong cash generation as evidenced by the 3 billion in cash from operating activities over the 20022004 time period we have continued to fund our portfolio of businesses and prudently manage capital spending while at the same time continuing our trend of increasing dividend payments to shareholders for 33 consecutive years and reducing our debt by over 1 billion over the past three years additionally we repurchased 100 million of ppg common stock in 2004 and have announced plans to repurchase up to 500 million in ppg common stock by the end of 2005 

we remain confident that ppg is well positioned to benefit from the expected worldwide economic growth in 2005 

accounting standard adopted in 2004 

effective jan 1 2004 we adopted the fair value method of recording stockbased compensation as defined in statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” for stock options awarded to employees after the date of adoption and for previously issued stock options that were not vested as of jan 1 2004 using the modified prospective transition method the adoption increased “selling general and administrative” expense by 20 million 13 million aftertax or 007 per share for the year ended dec 31 2004 this impact reflects the fact that beginning in 2004 stock option grants under the ppg stock plan will vest three years after the date of grant previously original grants of stock options under this plan vested after one year additionally under the modified prospective transition method we recorded a deferred tax asset of 8 million and a corresponding increase to additional paidin capital equal to the deferred tax benefit that would have been recognized in 2003 had compensation expense been recorded under the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 for options outstanding at the date of adoption but not fully vested 

  

accounting standards to be adopted in future years 

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas no 151 requires the exclusion of certain costs from inventories and the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventories to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of this statement are effective for costs incurred after dec 31 2005 we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect the adoption of this standard will have on ppg however we do not expect it to have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

in december 2004 the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 123 “sharebased payments” which now 

  

2004 annual report and form 10k n ppg industries inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

requires that stock options be expensed based on their fair value as discussed above ppg began expensing stock options effective jan 1 2004 and consequently our adoption of this revised statement in 2005 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

  

performance in 2003 compared with 2002 

  

overall performance 

our sales increased 9 to 88 billion in 2003 from 81 billion in 2002 sales increased 4 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations 3 due to improved volumes across all of our business segments and 2 due to higher selling prices primarily in our chemicals segment 

the gross profit percentage decreased slightly to 369 in 2003 from 372 in 2002 higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and inflationary cost increases were offset by higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the benefits realized from improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments 

net income loss and earnings loss per share – diluted for 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following table along with the more significant charges that were included in those amounts 

  

 the notes referenced in the above table are found under item 8 of this form 10k 

net income for 2003 compared to 2002 was 563 million higher the significant charges in the table above account for 514 million of this change the remaining 49 million increase in net income was due to a combination of factors the factors causing 2003 net income to be higher were higher selling prices in our chemicals segment higher sales volumes across all of our business segments the favorable effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass segments the gain on the sale of certain nonstrategic assets including marketable securities and lower interest expense due to lower debt levels in 2003 higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and the negative effects of inflation were factors reducing 2003 net income 

results of business segments 

  

  coatings sales increased 353 million or 8 in 2003 sales increased 6 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations and 2 from improved volumes primarily from our aerospace architectural automotive and industrial businesses lower pricing in our automotive business offset higher pricing in our other coatings businesses operating income increased 110 million in 2003 operating income in 2003 and 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 2 million and 73 million respectively factors increasing operating income were lower restructuring costs in 2003 the higher sales volumes described above improved manufacturing efficiencies the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and lower overhead costs factors decreasing operating income were inflationary cost increases and higher pension and postretirement medical costs 

glass sales increased 79 million or 4 in 2003 sales increased 4 from improved volumes primarily from our automotive original equipment automotive replacement glass and flat glass businesses net of lower volumes from our fiber glass business sales also increased 3 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european fiber glass operations these sales increases were offset by a 3 decline due to lower selling prices from our automotive original equipment automotive replacement glass and fiber glass businesses operating income decreased 74 million in 2003 operating income in 2003 and 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 2 million and 1 million respectively factors decreasing operating income were lower selling prices of 68 million higher pension and postretirement medical costs of 67 million and higher energy costs of 30 million factors increasing operating income in 2003 by 91 million were the improved manufacturing efficiencies lower overhead costs the higher sales volumes described above and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation our fiber glass business continued to experience significant sales and earnings declines principally as a result of global industry overcapacity which has led to substantially lower pricing 

chemicals sales increased 257 million or 17 in 2003 sales increased 13 from higher selling prices for 

  

2004 annual report and form 10k n ppg industries inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

our commodity products sales also increased 3 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations and 1 from higher optical fine and silicas products volumes net of lower commodity volumes operating income increased 104 million in 2003 operating income in 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 1 million higher commodity product pricing in 2003 increased operating earnings by 200 million while higher energy and pension and postretirement medical costs decreased operating earnings by 70 million and 22 million respectively 

other significant factors 

the company’s pretax earnings in 2003 included net periodic pension expense of 176 million compared to 54 million in 2002 the increase in pension costs is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets through the end of 2002 a reduction in the expected return on plan assets assumption for 2003 and the amortization of accumulated actuarial losses in addition the cost of other postretirement benefits in 2003 was 115 million compared to 91 million in 2002 on a combined basis the increase in net periodic benefit cost of 146 million was 44 million for the coatings segment 67 million for the glass segment 22 million for the chemicals segment and 13 million for corporate 

although the majority of the company’s defined benefit plans continued to be underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation “abo” basis as of dec 31 2003 the underfunded amount was lower which resulted in an increase in shareholders’ equity through a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income of 147 million aftertax see note 12 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

the effective tax rate for 2003 was 3476 

  

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought in a suit filed by marvin windows and doors ppg has appealed the unfavorable judgment awarded by a federal jury the appeals court heard the parties’ arguments on june 9 2003 but has not yet rendered its decision ppg believes it has meritorious defenses to the plaintiff’s claims and has reasonable prospects of prevailing on appeal see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for an expanded description of this case and certain other lawsuits including the proposed ppg settlement arrangement for asbestos claims announced on may 14 2002 as discussed in item 3 and note 13 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the ppg settlement arrangement described in note 13 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling  81 million and 92 million respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2004 2003 and 2002 totaled  15 million 21 million and 15 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the accompanying statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated  26 million 16 million and 22 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in addition to the amounts currently reserved the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million which range is unchanged from the prior year end such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year we anticipate that charges against income in 2005 will be within that range it is possible however that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this expectation see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for an expanded description of certain of these environmental contingencies in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity 

in june 2003 our partner in a fiber glass joint venture in south america filed for bankruptcy upon resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings the partner’s ownership interest may transfer to one of its senior secured creditors or be sold while ppg expects operations at the joint venture to continue the company is currently evaluating its options with respect to this venture which may include the sale or liquidation of the venture should liquidation occur ppg’s exposure to loss would be

limited to  12 million which includes a combination of the company’s investment outstanding receivables and a loan guarantee related to this venture 

  

impact of inflation 

in 2004 the combined impact of lower overall selling prices and higher production costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher raw material and labor costs across all our segments and higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments was only partially offset through improved manufacturing efficiencies in 2003 the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments was offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments in 2002 the decline in selling prices and the negative effects of inflation on our production costs were not fully recovered through improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses and lower raw material and natural gas costs 

we expect the negative impact of inflation on our production costs to be more significant in 2005 than in 2004 primarily because of the expected increases in our coatings raw material costs we anticipate that the combination of continuing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and an overall increase in our selling prices in 2005 will offset the negative impact of inflation but achieving that result will be a challenge 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

cash from operating activities was  1018 million 1123 million and 872 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively capital spending was  311 million 220 million and 260 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively this spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses environmental control projects and business acquisitions which amounted to  67 million 3 million and 22 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively capital spending excluding acquisitions is expected to be approximately 350 million during 2005 

we periodically review our array of businesses in relation to our overall strategic and performance objectives as part of this review we may acquire or divest of certain businesses or enter into joint ventures with other companies during 2005 we anticipate that any acquisitions would be funded through a combination of cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and to a lesser extent external funding sources or the issuance of stock 

dividends paid to shareholders totaled  307 million 294 million and 287 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899 and 2004 marked the 33rd consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders over time our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately onethird of our earnings per share 

during 2004 the company repurchased 15 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 100 million under previously authorized share repurchase programs during 2003 and 2002 the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock at dec 31 2004 there are 94 million shares of common stock authorized for repurchase remaining under a program approved in october 2000 in january 2005 the company announced plans to repurchase up to 500 million of ppg common stock by year end 2005 under this program 

while we have had no mandatory funding contribution required under pension benefit guarantee corporation or internal revenue service “irs” regulations for our us pension plans we chose to make voluntary contributions of 100 million in 2004 and 22 million in 2003 these pension contributions will allow the company more flexibility in determining both the timing and amounts of future mandatory contributions under the complex erisa and irs pension funding regulations based on our current estimate under existing us pension funding regulations with available funding credits there will be no mandatory pension funding requirement until 2008 at the earliest even if our plan assets remain at december 2004 levels during 2004 2003 and 2002 we made contributions to our nonus pension plans totaling  40 million 41 million and 20 million respectively we expect to make mandatory contributions to our nonus plans in 2005 of approximately  20 million 

during 2004 after funding the matters described above we were able to repay over 350 million of debt consequently the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity declined to 27 at dec 31 2004 from 36 at dec 31 2003 we were also able to increase our cash by about 200 million in 2004 the company has invested this cash on a shortterm basis in high credit quality cash equivalents 

cash from operations and the company’s debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending share repurchases dividend payments contributions to pension plans amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement and operating requirements including ppg’s significant contractual obligations which

are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement 

  

  the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases and natural gas consistent with customary industry practice these also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 5 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

see note 7 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company may issue up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in july 1999 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 7 “debt and bank credit arrangements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable environmental remediation pending litigation against the company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 11 “income taxes” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually see note 12 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments evaluating market interest rate indices and using an outside advisor to determine the yield on a diversified portfolio of available high quality fixed income securities that matches our projected future benefit payments the discount rate assumption for 2005 is 60 for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points with all other assumptions held constant would increase 2005 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 9 million and 6 million respectively 

the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future longterm investment returns for 2004 the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 85 we expect to use the same assumption for 2005 a reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points with other assumptions held constant would increase 2005 net periodic pension expense by approximately 11 million

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill was impaired as of dec 31 2004 however the fair value of our fine chemicals business declined during 2004 as a result some or all of the related goodwill of 28 million is at risk in 2005 for impairment should our projected growth in the business not occur the excess of the fair value over the carrying value of our fiber glass business grew during 2004 

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants engineers lawyers and actuaries the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

currency 

during 2004 and 2003 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar the effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by 180 million and 328 million for the years ended dec 31 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition the weaker us dollar had a favorable impact on 2004 and 2003 pretax earnings of approximately 35 million and 50 million respectively 

the euro and the british pound sterling strengthened against the us dollar by 18 and 11 respectively during 2002 the effects of translating the net assets and net earnings of our operations denominated in these currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by approximately 140 million but did not have a significant impact on the results of operations this was offset in part by the continued devaluation of the argentine peso which reduced our net investment in argentina by 39 million 

  

research and development 

innovation and technology have been a hallmark of our company’s success throughout its history research and development costs totaled over 3 of sales in each of the past three years representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2005 these costs include technologydriven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service as well as the costs of developing new products because of our broad array of products and customers we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission also note the following cautionary statements 

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets which also depends on economic and political conditions foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if ppg’s settlement agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective however it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition operations or liquidity 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates natural gas prices and ppg’s stock price arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce this market risk a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 9 “derivative financial instruments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage our exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonable unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s financial results cash flows and financial condition 

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2004 and 2003 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk the fair value of these contracts as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 was not material the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies would also not have been material 

ppg had nonus dollardenominated debt of 44 million and 28 million outstanding as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 11 million and 7 million as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk and as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 the fair value of the interest rate swaps in place was an asset of  4 million and 9 million respectively the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by  9 million and 10 million as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately  2 million and 1 million as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately  36 million and 40 million as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 respectively such changes would not have had a material effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place was a liability of  2 million and an asset of 3 million as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 respectively these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to rising prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 of approximately  1 million and 3 million respectively 

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 9 “derivative financial instruments” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of dec 31 2004 and 2003 was an asset of  19 million and 15 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by 6 million as of dec 31 2004 and 2003

environmental matters 

  

like other companies ppg is subject to the existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 9 million in 2003 8 million in 2002 and 22 million in 2001 it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2004 will approximate 14 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and costly 

  

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 89 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 23 sites on the national priority list npl the number of sites is comparable with the prior year while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 92 million and 87million respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2003 2002 and 2001 totaled 21 million 15 million and 29 million respectively 

  

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year we anticipate that charges against income in 2004 will be within that range it is possible however that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this expectation in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to product liability contract patent environmental antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s business to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers 

  

2003 annual report and form 10k • ppg industries inc 13 

and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

  

the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

the company has been named as a defendant along with various codefendants in a number of antitrust lawsuits filed in federal and state courts by various plaintiffs these suits allege ppg was involved with competitors in fixing prices and allocating markets for the automotive refinish industry and for certain glass products twentynine glass antitrust cases were filed in federal courts all of which have been consolidated in the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania located in pittsburgh pa and the court has ruled that the case may proceed as a class action all of the initial defendants in the glass class action antitrust case other than ppg have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs on may 29 2003 the court granted ppg’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the claims against ppg in the glass class action antitrust case the plaintiffs in that case have appealed that order to the us third circuit court of appeals 

  

in addition approximately 60 cases alleging antitrust violations in the automotive refinish industry have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions the approximately 55 federal cases have been consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania located in philadelphia pa but these proceedings are still at an early stage the other state cases have either been stayed pending resolution of the federal proceedings or have been dismissed the plaintiffs in these various cases are seeking economic and treble damages and injunctive relief ppg believes it has meritorious defenses in these lawsuits 

  

the company has been a defendant since april 1994 in a suit filed by marvin windows and doors marvin alleging numerous claims including breach of warranty all of the plaintiff’s claims other than breach of warranty were dismissed however on feb 14 2002 a federal jury awarded marvin 136 million on the remaining claim subsequently the court added 20 million for interest bringing the total judgment to 156 million ppg has appealed that judgment the appeals court has heard the parties’ arguments but has not yet rendered its decision ppg believes it has meritorious defenses to the plaintiff’s claims and has reasonable prospects of prevailing on appeal 

  

for over years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos for a description of asbestos litigation affecting the company and the terms and status of the proposed ppg settlement arrangement announced may 14 2002 see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

over the past several years the company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of leadbased coatings applications ppg has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

performance in 2003 compared with 2002 

  

overall performance 

  

our sales increased 9 to 88 billion in 2003 from 81 billion in 2002 sales increased 4 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations 3 due to improved volumes across all of our business segments and 2 due to higher selling prices primarily in our chemicals segment 

  

the gross profit percentage decreased slightly to 369 in 2003 from 372 in 2002 higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and inflationary cost increases were offset by higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the benefits realized from improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments 

  

net income loss and earnings loss per share — diluted for 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following table along with the more significant charges that were included in those amounts 

  

 the notes referenced in the above table are found under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

net income for 2003 compared to 2002 was 563 million higher the significant charges in the table above account for 514 million of this change the remaining 49 million increase in net income was due to a combination of factors the factors causing 2003 net income to be higher were higher selling prices in our chemicals segment higher sales volumes across all of our business segments the favorable effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass segments the gain on the sale of certain nonstrategic assets including marketable securities and lower interest expense due to lower debt levels in 2003 higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and the negative effects of inflation were factors reducing 2003 net income 

  

results of business segments 

  

   

coatings sales increased 353 million or 8 in 2003 sales increased 6 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations and 2 from improved volumes primarily from our aerospace architectural automotive and industrial businesses lower pricing in our automotive business offset higher pricing in our other coatings businesses operating income increased 102 million in 2003 operating income in 2003 and 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 2 million and 73 million respectively factors increasing operating income were lower restructuring costs in 2003 the higher sales volumes described above improved manufacturing efficiencies the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and lower overhead costs factors decreasing operating income were inflationary cost increases and higher pension and postretirement medical costs 

  

glass sales increased 79 million or 4 in 2003 sales increased 4 from improved volumes primarily from our automotive original equipment automotive replacement glass and flat glass businesses net of lower volumes from our fiber glass business sales also increased 3 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european fiber glass operations these sales increases were offset by a 3 decline due to lower selling prices from our automotive original equipment automotive replacement glass and fiber glass businesses operating income decreased 72 million in 2003 operating income in 2003 and 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 2 million and 1 million respectively factors decreasing operating income were lower selling prices of 68 million higher pension and postretirement medical costs of 65 million and higher energy costs of 30 million factors increasing operating income in 2003 by 91 million were the improved manufacturing efficiencies lower overhead costs the higher sales volumes described above and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation our fiber glass business continues to experience significant sales and earnings declines principally as a result of global industry overcapacity which has led to substantially lower pricing 

  

2003 annual report and form 10k • ppg industries inc 17 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

chemicals sales increased 257 million or 17 in 2003 sales increased 13 from higher selling prices for our commodity products sales also increased 3 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations and 1 from higher optical fine and silicas products volumes net of lower commodity volumes operating income increased 108 million in 2003 operating income in 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 1 million higher commodity product pricing in 2003 increased operating earnings by 200 million while higher energy and pension and postretirement medical costs decreased operating earnings by 70 million and 18 million respectively 

  

other significant factors 

  

the company’s pretax earnings in 2003 included net periodic pension expense of 176 million compared to 54 million in 2002 the increase in pension costs is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets through the end of 2002 a reduction in the expected return on plan assets assumption for 2003 and the amortization of accumulated actuarial losses in addition the cost of other postretirement benefits in 2003 was 115 million compared to 91 million in 2002 on a combined basis the increase in net periodic benefit cost of 146 million was 52 million for the coatings segment 65 million for the glass segment 18 million for the chemicals segment and 11 million for corporate 

  

although the majority of the company’s defined benefit plans continued to be underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation abo basis as of dec 31 2003 the underfunded amount was lower which resulted in an increase in shareholders’ equity through a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income of 147 million aftertax see note 12 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

  

the effective tax rate for 2003 was approximately 35 and is expected to be the same for 2004 

  

outlook 

  

the us economy continued to gain strength in late 2003 consumer confidence buoyed by tax cuts low interest rates and overall improvements in the us equity markets improved during the year particularly during the fourth quarter the commercial construction sector remained at very low levels but has been showing signs of improvement throughout the second half of the year increases in industrial production have been positive since july however for the full year growth was only slightly positive strong consumer confidence has been a key driver of the current economic recovery including its impact on automotive sales european automotive markets were weak at the beginning of the year but have improved although as with the us markets sales were below the high levels of the past few years as the new year begins the economic reports suggest that the us economy is poised for growth extending the improvement that was seen in the second half of the year 

  

for 2004 we expect the us economy to settle into a more stable pattern in terms of quarterly gdp growth compared to 2003 interest rates should remain at historically low levels much of this year and continue to support economic expansion increasing values of stock portfolios are likely to be a positive factor while the benefit from households refinancing their debt is unlikely to provide the same boost as it has during the industrial slowdown of the past few years 

  

overall global economic growth in 2004 is expected to reach its highest level since 2000 possibly exceeding three percent in terms of real gdp growth growth in europe is likely to be negatively impacted by the strength of the euro which hit a new alltime high against the us dollar in january of 2004 economic growth in south america will probably remain relatively slow compared to most other regions the asian market should once again post solid growth especially in china the chinese economy is the fastest growing of the world’s ten largest economies with production of vehicles and consumer goods increasing at significant rates while this provides an attractive market for our coatings products it also encourages expansion of production in the region which in turn contributes to the downward price pressure on some of our glass and fiber glass businesses where there is excess global capacity and we compete against products produced in china and other low labor cost markets 

  

while we have consistently focused on reducing our costs we continue to be challenged by high and rising costs for employee benefits particularly pensions and medical prior to 2001 our pension income more than offset retiree medical costs in 2003 pension expense combined with other postretirement benefit costs were nearly 300 million this increase in costs results from a combination of the decline in the market value of the company’s pension plans assets due primarily to negative investment returns in the us equity market during 2000 – 2002 a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets lower discount rate assumption and rising medical costs particularly for prescription drugs this cost increase translates to about 119 per share in lower earnings in 2003 compared with 2000 while the current low interest rate environment is expected to continue which raises the present value of future benefit obligations there was some brighter news in 2003 with respect to our us pension plans as a result of an actual return on plan assets for the year of a little more than 25 consequently the underfunded status of these plans was reduced along with our recorded minimum pension liability additionally even though the plans continue to be underfunded we will not be required to make a mandatory funding contribution to the us plans under pension benefit guarantee corporation or irs regulations until at least 2007 even if our plan assets stay flat with december 2003 levels these developments are also good news for 2004 pension costs which are currently estimated to be slightly less than those in 2003 other postretirement benefit costs however in 2004 are expected to be about 15 million higher than last year this increase in costs does not include the benefit of any anticipated reductions 

  

18 2003 annual report and form 10k • ppg industries inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

as a result of the implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the act ppg is currently evaluating the provisions of the act and its potential impact to our postretirement medical plans which we believe will ultimately reduce our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and other postretirement benefit costs 

  

high natural gas costs in north america continue to be a drag on earnings changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments each onedollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu million british thermal units would have a direct impact of approximately 60 million to 70 million on our annual operating costs it is difficult to predict future natural gas prices which continue to be high and volatile in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we use a number of techniques which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes switching to alternative fuels and hedging as of dec 31 2003 we had hedged approximately ten percent of our anticipated natural gas requirements for 2004 at an average price of 480 per mmbtu factoring in the expected benefit from these hedges based on an average cost for january and february 2004 of approximately 600 the average cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2004 would be approximately 590 per mmbtu or an increase of about 6 over the average cost of natural gas in the first quarter of 2003 

  

in 2004 we see the potential for increases in the prices for raw materials used in our coatings businesses especially as the economic expansion begins to gain momentum at the same time the anticipated growth in industrial production may strengthen the end use markets of our chloralkali customers and support higher ecu prices which had declined at the end of 2003 even though they rose significantly for the full year compared with 2002 

  

we expect to remain focused in 2004 on serving our customer needs investing in technology to bring new products to market and reducing our costs further we have a demonstrated track record of generating cash as evidenced by the 31 billion in cash from operating activities over the 2001 – 2003 time period after capital spending which we have managed tightly and payment of dividends to our shareholders we have been directing our cash flow to reduce debt by more than 13 billion over the past three years we plan to use our cash in a similar manner in 2004 

  

we are well positioned to face the challenges that come our way during 2004 we remain confident that our focus on growing revenues while continuously working to improve our manufacturing efficiencies and lower our costs will enable ppg to once again take advantage of economic growth both in the us and international markets 

  

accounting standard adopted in 2004 

  

effective jan 1 2004 we adopted the fair value method of recording stockbased compensation as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 for stock options awarded to employees after the date of adoption and for previously issued stock options that were not vested as of jan 1 2004 using the modified prospective transition method we expect the impact of adoption to increase 2004 stockbased compensation expense by approximately 10 million aftertax or 006 per share this impact reflects the fact that beginning in 2004 stock option grants under the ppg stock plan will vest three years after the date of grant previously original grants of stock options under this plan vested after one year as a result of this vesting provision and assuming the number of options granted in 2004 and 2005 and the fair value of those options is comparable to those granted in 2003 the impact of this accounting change will grow to approximately 009 and 012 per share in 2005 and 2006 respectively at which time a full annual run rate of expense is reached additionally under the modified prospective transition method we are required to record a deferred tax asset of 9 million and a corresponding increase to additional paidin capital equal to the deferred tax benefit that would have been recognized in 2003 had compensation expense been recorded under the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 for options outstanding at the date of adoption but not fully vested 

  

performance in 2002 compared with 2001 

  

overall performance 

  

our sales decreased 1 to 81 billion from 82 billion in 2001 sales declined 2 due to lower selling prices in our glass and chemicals segments this decline was partially offset by higher volumes in our coatings and chemicals segments net of lower volumes in our glass segment 

  

the gross profit percentage increased slightly to 372 in 2002 from 371 in 2001 the increase in gross profit percentage was due to improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our business segments lower raw material costs in our coatings segment and lower energy costs these improvements were substantially offset by lower selling prices in our glass and chemicals segments and higher pension and postretirement medical costs

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

net loss income and loss earnings per share – diluted for 2002 and 2001 are presented in the following table along with the more significant charges that were included in those amounts 

  

 the notes referenced in the above table are found under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

net loss income for 2002 compared to 2001 was 456 million lower the significant charges in the table above account for 474 million of this change the remaining 18 million increase in net loss income was due to lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass businesses lower environmental remediation expenses higher insurance recoveries lower interest expense due to the lower debt levels in 2002 and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations these favorable factors were substantially offset by an increase in pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our businesses the negative effects of inflation and lower equity earnings primarily in our glass segment also as a result of the company’s adoption as of jan 1 2002 of the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the carrying value of goodwill and certain trademarks will no longer be amortized and will instead be tested for impairment annually such amortization reduced earnings in 2001 by 32 million aftertax or 020 a share 

  

results of business segments 

  

   

coatings sales increased 72 million or 2 in 2002 sales increased 1 from improved volumes primarily in our architectural north american and asian automotive original equipment and industrial businesses offset in part by lower sales volumes in our aerospace and refinish businesses sales also increased 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation operating income increased 110 million in 2002 operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 73 million and 83 million respectively the increase in operating income is attributable to higher sales volume lower raw material and overhead costs improved manufacturing efficiencies lower restructuring costs in 2002 and the benefit of goodwill and certain trademarks no longer being amortized due to the company’s adoption of sfas no 142 these were offset in part by higher selling costs in our architectural business higher pension and postretirement medical costs inflationary cost increases and 3 million in lower equity earnings primarily due to the writeoff of a receivable from a customer by one of our asian joint ventures 

  

glass sales decreased 165 million or 7 in 2002 sales volumes declined 5 principally in our automotive replacement glass flat glass and fiber glass businesses sales also decreased 2 due to lower selling prices principally in our north american automotive original glass flat glass and fiber glass businesses operating income decreased 112 million in 2002 operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 1 million and 10 million respectively the decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volume and selling prices described above operating income also decreased due to lower equity earnings a shift in sales mix to lower margin products and higher pension and postretirement medical costs offset in part by improved manufacturing efficiencies lower restructuring costs in 2002 and lower energy and overhead costs 

  

  

  

  

  

  

chemicals sales decreased 9 million in 2002 sales volumes increased 9 principally from our chloralkali fine chemicals and optical products offset by a 9 decrease in selling prices principally for our chloralkali products operating income increased 33 million in 2002 operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 1 million and 7 million respectively the increase in operating income is attributable to improved sales volume improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses lower energy costs lower restructuring costs in 2002 and lower environmental remediation expenses partially offset by lower selling prices for our chloralkali products and higher pension and postretirement medical costs 

  

other significant factors 

  

the company’s pretax loss in 2002 included net periodic pension expense of 54 million as compared to net periodic pension income of 53 million in 2001 the increase in net periodic pension expense is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets a reduction of the expected return on plan assets assumption for 2002 and the amortization of accumulated actuarial losses 

  

additionally as of dec 31 2002 the majority of the company’s defined benefit pension plans had an abo in excess of plan assets as a result the company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment in 2002 this adjustment reduced the prepaid pension asset by 912 

  

20 2003 annual report and form 10k • ppg industries inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

million increased the intangible pension asset by 96 million and the minimum pension liability by 326 million and reflected a deferred tax benefit of 416 million with a resulting reduction in shareholders’ equity through an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of 726 million 

  

in 2002 the company resolved all matters related to its federal income tax returns for the years 1994 to 1998 including matters that were on appeal related to the 1994 to 1996 tax returns in connection with the resolution of these matters the company surrendered in july 2002 certain companyowned life insurance policies and received proceeds of 32 million which are included in “reductions of other property and investments” in the investing activities section in the statement of cash flows under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

the decrease in shortterm debt during 2002 is due principally to the repayment of various us and nonus debt obligations 

  

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought in a suit filed by marvin windows and doors ppg has appealed the 156 million judgment awarded by a federal jury the appeals court has heard the parties’ arguments but has not yet rendered its decision ppg believes it has meritorious defenses to the plaintiff’s claims and has reasonable prospects of prevailing on appeal see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for an expanded description of this case and certain other lawsuits including the proposed ppg settlement arrangement for asbestos claims announced on may 14 2002 as discussed in note 13 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the ppg settlement arrangement described in note 13 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 92 million and 87 million respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2003 2002 and 2001 totaled 21 million 15 million and 29 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the accompanying statement of income cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 16 million 22 million and 19 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively in addition to the amounts currently reserved the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million which range is unchanged from the prior year end such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year we anticipate that charges against income in 2004 will be within that range see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for an expanded description of certain of these environmental contingencies in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity 

  

in june 2003 our partner in a fiber glass joint venture in south america filed for bankruptcy upon resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings the partner’s ownership interest may transfer to one of its senior secured creditors or be sold while ppg expects operations at the joint venture to continue the company is currently evaluating its options with respect to this venture which include its sale or the liquidation of the venture should liquidation occur ppg’s exposure to loss would be limited to 12 million which includes a combination of the company’s investment outstanding receivables and a loan guarantee related to this venture 

  

impact of inflation 

  

ppg’s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 

  

in 2003 the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments was offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments in 2002 the decline in selling prices and the negative effects of inflation on our production costs were not fully recovered through improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses and lower raw material and natural gas costs in 2001 the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not fully recovered through price increases and manufacturing efficiencies which were adversely impacted by lower production volumes 

  

in 2004 the expected inflationary and market pressures on costs as well as a decline in selling prices will not be fully recovered by ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

during the past three years we continued to have sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements to fund our capital spending share repurchase programs and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders 

  

cash from operating activities was 1123 million 872 million and 1060 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively capital spending was 220 million 260 million and 301 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively this spending related to modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses environmental control projects and business acquisitions which amounted to 3 million 22 million and 10 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively capital spending excluding acquisitions is expected to be in the range of 250 million to 300 million during 2004 

  

we periodically review our array of businesses in comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives as part of this review we may acquire or divest of certain businesses or enter into joint ventures with other companies during 2004 we anticipate that any acquisitions completed will be funded through a combination of cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and to a lesser extent external funding sources or the issuance of stock 

  

dividends paid to shareholders totaled 294 million 287 million and 283 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively ppg has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899 and 2003 marked the 32nd consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders over time our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately onethird of our earnings per share 

  

the company has two authorized share repurchase programs under the program initiated in november 1998 there are 09 million of common stock authorized for repurchase remaining in october 2000 we authorized another program to repurchase an additional 10 million shares of common stock during 2003 and 2002 the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock and in 2001 repurchased only 01 million shares at a cost of 5 million however the company announced on january 15 2004 that it will begin to repurchase shares of common stock from timetotime in market transactions of small amounts through midfebruary 2004 we have repurchased 01 million shares of ppg common stock at a cost of 6 million 

  

while we had no mandatory funding contribution required in 2003 under pension benefit guarantee corporation or irs regulations for our us pension plans we chose to make a voluntary contribution to these plans of 22 million for 2004 we have no mandatory funding contribution required for our us plans although we may make further voluntary contributions during 2003 2002 and 2001 we made contributions to our nonus pension plans totaling 41 million 20 million and 13 million respectively we expect to make contributions to our nonus plans in 2004 of approximately 30 million 

  

during 2003 after meeting the needs for funding the matters described above we were able to repay nearly 400 million of debt bringing the total reduction in debt over the last three years to more than 13 billion consequently the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity declined to 36 at dec 31 2003 from 49 at dec 31 2002 we were also able to increase our cash by about 375 million in 2003 the company has invested this cash on a shortterm basis in high credit quality cash equivalents 

  

cash from operations and the company’s debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending share repurchase dividend payments contributions to pension plans amounts due under the asbestos settlement and operating requirements including ppg’s significant contractual obligations which are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the asbestos settlement 

  

    

the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases and natural gas consistent with customary industry practice these also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 5 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

see note 7 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

  

in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit the company may issue up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in july 1999

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 7 “debt and bank credit arrangements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

  

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable environmental remediation pending litigation against the company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 11 “income taxes” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually see note 12 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 

  

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on this testing none of our goodwill was impaired as of dec 31 2003 however the fair value of our fiber glass business declined during 2003 as a result the related goodwill of 47 million is at risk in 2004 for impairment should our projected recovery in this business not occur 

  

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants engineers lawyers and actuaries the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

  

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

  

currency 

  

during 2003 the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates most notably against the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar the effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in nonus currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by 328 million in addition the weak us dollar had a favorable impact on 2003 pretax earnings of approximately 50 million compared to 2002 

  

the euro and the british pound sterling strengthened against the us dollar 18 and 11 respectively during 2002 the effects of translating the net assets and net earnings of our operations denominated in these currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by approximately 140 million but did not have a significant impact on the results of operations 

  

this was offset in part by the continued devaluation of the argentine peso which reduced our net investment in argentina by 39 million to a total of 29 million as of dec 31 2002 any reduction in the value of these net assets resulting from a further devaluation of the argentine peso will result in a direct charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders’ equity 

  

research and development 

  

innovation and technology have been a hallmark of our company’s success throughout its history research and development costs totaled over 3 of sales in each of the past three years representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2004 these costs include technologydriven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service as well as the costs of developing new products because of our broad array of products and customers we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made 

  

2003 annual report and form 10k • ppg industries inc 23 

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

  

forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the sec also note the following cautionary statements 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements among these factors are increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets which also depends on economic and political conditions foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation including litigation that could result if ppg’s settlement agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective further it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

  

the consequences of material differences in the results as compared to those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition operations or liquidity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates natural gas prices and ppg’s stock price arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce this market risk a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 9 “derivative financial instruments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

the following disclosures summarize ppg’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use and fair value of derivatives employed to manage our exposure to such risks quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonable unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg’s financial results cash flows and financial condition 

  

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2003 and 2002 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk the fair value of these contracts was an asset of 02 million and 1 million as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from adverse changes in the exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies would have totaled approximately 02 million and 1 million as of dec31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

ppg had nonus dollardenominated debt of 28 million and 317 million as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the significant decrease in the debt levels is attributable to the company’s ongoing efforts to reduce overall debt levels by deploying a portion of its operating cash flows for this purpose a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 7 million and 46 million as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk and as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of 9 million and 23 million respectively the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by 10 million and 7 million as of dec31 2003 and 2002 respectively if variable interest rates increased by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately 1 million and 3 million as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 40 million and 53 million as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 respectively such changes would not have had a material effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

  

the fair value of natural gas swap and option contracts was an asset of 3 million and 24 million as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 respectively these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to rising prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap and option contracts outstanding as of dec31 2003 and 2002 of approximately 3 million and 8 million respectively 

  

an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 9 “derivative financial instruments” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k in addition to the change in ppg’s stock price contributing to the change in fair value of this instrument was the increase in the number of shares purchased by the bank from 504900 shares as of dec 31 2002 to 904900 shares as of dec 31 2003 the fair value of this instrument as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 was an asset of 15 million and 1 million respectively a 10 decrease in ppg’s stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by 6 million and 3 million as of dec 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

environmental matters 

  

like other companies ppg is subject to the existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment capital expenditures for environmental control projects were 8 million in 2002 and 22 million in 2001 and 2000 it is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2003 will approximate 20 million although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and costly 

  

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 94 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 23 sites on the national priority list npl the number of sites is comparable with the prior year while ppg is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 87 million and 94 million respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2002 2001 and 2000 totaled 15 million 29 million and 18 million respectively 

  

the company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year we anticipate that charges against income in 2003 will be within that range it is possible however that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this expectation in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity see “commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters” in management’s discussion and analysis under item 7 of this form 10k for additional information related to environmental matters

 item 2 properties

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims the most significant of which are described below relate to product liability contract patent environmental antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg’s business to the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage ppg believes it has adequate insurance however certain of ppg’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims and other insurers as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented ppg’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental asbestos and other matters 

  

the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable however management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described below does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

the company has been named as a defendant in a number of antitrust lawsuits filed in federal and state courts by various plaintiffs these suits allege ppg was involved with competitors in fixing prices and allocating markets for the automotive refinish industry and for certain glass products twentynine glass antitrust cases were filed in federal courts all of which have been consolidated in federal district court in pittsburgh pa and the court has ruled that the case may proceed as a class action all of the initial defendants in the glass class action antitrust case other than ppg have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs in addition approximately 65 cases alleging antitrust violations in the automotive refinish industry have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions and have been consolidated in federal district court in philadelphia pa but these proceedings are still at an early stage the plaintiffs in these cases are seeking economic and treble

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

performance in 2002 compared with 2001 

  

overall performance 

  

our sales decreased 1 to 81 billion from 82 billion in 2001 sales declined 2 due to lower selling prices in our glass and chemicals segments this decline was partially offset by higher volumes in our coatings and chemicals segments net of lower volumes in our glass segment 

  

the gross profit percentage increased slightly to 372 in 2002 from 371 in 2001 the increase in gross profit percentage was due to improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our business segments lower raw material costs in our coatings segment and lower energy costs these improvements were substantially offset by lower selling prices in our glass and chemicals segments and higher pension and postretirement medical costs 

  

reported net loss income and loss earnings per share – diluted in 2002 and 2001 is summarized in the following table we have also identified significant nonrecurring items in 2002 and 2001 

  

   

the note references in the above table are found under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

aside from the factors described above the increase in net income was also due to lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass businesses lower environmental remediation expenses higher insurance recoveries lower interest expense due to the lower debt levels in 2002 and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our european operations these favorable factors were substantially offset by an increase in pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our businesses the negative effects of inflation and lower equity earnings primarily in our glass segment also as a result of the company’s adoption as of jan 1 2002 of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the carrying value of goodwill and certain trademarks will no longer be amortized and will instead be tested for impairment annually such amortization reduced earnings in 2001 by 32 million aftertax or 020 a share 

  

results of business segments 

  

   

coatings sales increased 72 million or 2 to 45 billion in 2002 sales increased 1 from improved volumes primarily in our architectural north american and asian automotive original equipment and industrial businesses offset in part by lower sales volumes in our aerospace and refinish businesses sales also increased 1 due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation operating income increased to 605 million in 2002 compared to 495 million in 2001 operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 73 million and 83 million respectively excluding these charges operating income in 2002 was 678 million compared to 578 million in 2001 the increase in operating income is attributable to higher sales volume lower raw material and overhead costs improved manufacturing efficiencies and the benefit of goodwill and certain trademarks no longer being amortized due to the company’s adoption of sfas no 142 these were offset in part by higher selling costs in our architectural business higher pension and postretirement medical costs inflationary cost increases and 3 million in lower equity earnings primarily due to the writeoff of a receivable from a customer by one of our asian joint ventures 

  

glass sales decreased 7 to 21 billion in 2002 from 22 billion in 2001 sales volumes declined 5 principally in our automotive replacement glass flat glass and fiber glass businesses sales also decreased 2 due to lower selling prices principally in our north american automotive original glass flat glass and fiber glass businesses operating income decreased to 143 million in 2002 compared to 255 million in 2001 operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 1 million and 10 million respectively excluding these charges operating income in 2002 was 144 million compared to 265 million in 2001 the decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volume and selling prices described above operating income also decreased due to lower equity earnings a shift in sales mix to lower margin products and higher pension and postretirement medical costs offset in part by improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower energy and overhead costs 

  

chemicals sales were 15 billion in 2002 and 2001 sales volumes increased 9 principally from our chloralkali fine chemicals and optical products offset by a 9 decrease in selling prices principally for our chloralkali products operating income increased to 124 million in 2002 from 91 million in 2001 operating income in 2002 

  

18 ppg industries inc 2002 annual report and form 10k 

  

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 1 million and 7 million respectively excluding these charges operating income in 2002 was 125 million compared to 98 million in 2001 the increase in operating income is attributable to improved sales volume improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses lower energy costs and lower environmental remediation expenses partially offset by lower selling prices for our chloralkali products and higher pension and postretirement medical costs 

  

other significant factors 

  

the company’s pretax loss in 2002 included net periodic pension expense of 54 million as compared to net periodic pension income of 53 million in 2001 the increase in net periodic pension expense is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets a reduction of the expected return on plan assets assumption for 2002 and the amortization of actuarial losses 

  

additionally at dec 31 2002 the majority of the company’s defined benefit pension plans had an accumulated benefit obligation abo in excess of plan assets as a result the company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment in 2002 this adjustment reduced the prepaid pension asset by 912 million increased the intangible pension asset by 96 million and the minimum pension liability by 326 million and reflected a deferred tax benefit of 416 million with a resulting reduction in shareholders’ equity through an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of 726 million 

  

in 2002 the company resolved all matters related to its federal income tax returns for the years 1994 to 1998 including matters that were on appeal related to the 1994 to 1996 tax returns in connection with the resolution of these matters the company surrendered in july 2002 certain companyowned life insurance policies and received proceeds of 32 million which are included in “reductions of other property and investments” in the investing activities section in the statement of cash flows under item 8 of this form 10k the effective tax rate for 2003 is expected to approximate 36 

  

the decrease in shortterm debt during 2002 is due principally to the repayment of various us and nonus debt obligations 

  

outlook 

  

during 2002 we continued to experience mixed economic signals in the united states although we saw strong consumer spending and housing starts we also saw increased unemployment and low demand in the commercial construction sector additionally increases in industrial production which trended up for much of the year fell back in the fourth quarter business investment declined in 2002 for the second straight year economic results in 2002 also reflect the positive influence of the extension of sales incentive programs by the north american automobile manufacturers which were on and off throughout 2002 offsetting weaker european automotive markets 

  

as we begin the new year the economic reports indicate that the growth in the us economy appears to have stalled in the fourth quarter of 2002 factory orders and industrial production in the us declined in december the us dollar weakened against the euro and our trade deficit grew this news creates further uncertainty concerning the outlook for our economy in 2003 the consensus view calls for modest growth in consumer spending and a gradual rise in business investment that would lead to moderate growth in the us economy in the second half of the year the outlook for the global economy generally lags behind that of the us with some exceptions such as china that outlook is clouded by uncertainties such as the threat of terrorism or war with iraq 

  

despite the challenges of weaker economic conditions in 2002 and 2001 we were able to take several important steps to strengthen our company as a result of our commitment to financial discipline first we elevated our focus on cash flow and were able to pay down over 400 million in debt in 2002 and over 500 million in 2001 second as a result of the workforce reductions and other restructuring actions undertaken in 2002 and 2001 and our continued focus on cost reductions and improvements to business processes we reduced our manufacturing and overhead costs by 140 million in 2002 in 2003 we will continue to focus on reducing costs and improving productivity we will also continue our efforts to improve our customers’ results through the delivery of cost effective solutions these efforts will include developing new products and integrated productservice offerings to meet our customers’ needs 

  

while the steps taken above will translate into improved profitability costs for employee benefits continue to grow we expect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase by about 130 million in 2003 which will reduce earnings per share by about 050 this is due to the decline in the market value of the company’s pension plan assets due primarily to negative investment returns in the us equity market during the last three years a reduction in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption to approximately 875 for 2003 rising medical costs particularly for prescription drugs and a lower discount rate assumption despite the expected increase in these costs we do not believe that we will have a mandatory funding requirement under pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc or internal revenue service irs regulations in the nearterm so there will only be a minor impact on cash flows in 2003 as a result of these factors 

  

another potential risk in 2003 will be increases in energy and raw material costs particularly for natural gas and petroleumbased materials the factors driving these costs upward have historically created favorable market conditions for pricing in our chloralkali business during 2002 we benefited from lower raw material costs primarily associated with our coatings businesses as well as from lower natural gas costs however in the fourth quarter we began to see this benefit diminish and our natural gas costs in the fourth quarter of 2002 exceeded those for the same period of the prior year changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments each onedollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu million british thermal units could have a direct impact of 

  

2002 annual report and form 10k ppg industries inc 19 

  

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

approximately 60 million on our annual operating costs it has become increasingly more difficult to predict future natural gas prices which are expected to continue to be volatile over the next few years in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices we use a number of techniques which include hedging reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes and switching to alternative fuels as of dec 31 2002 we hedged approximately onethird of our anticipated natural gas requirements for 2003 at an average price of 325 per mmbtu 

  

we also expect the continuing consolidation of companies within our customer and competitor groups excess global automotive production capacity and the availability of imported products from low labor cost markets to lead to continued downward pressure on our selling prices 

  

for 2003 we expect slow and perhaps erratic expansion in our north american markets and gains in our asian markets we expect continued softness in our european and south american markets there are several developments that would signal a more solid economic environment for 2003 the most important of which would be steady growth in industrial production 

  

we expect that 2003 will be another challenging year due to the combination of worldwide political and economic uncertainties but we are confident that the steps we have taken put us on solid footing to reap the benefits of improved market conditions both in the us and abroad whenever they occur 

  

newly adopted accounting standards 

  

note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k describes and quantifies the company’s adoption of the provisions of the financial accounting standards board’s fasb standards on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective jan 1 2002 

  

other new accounting standards 

  

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which is effective jan 1 2003 the cumulative effect of this change in accounting will decrease our 2003 net income by less than 10 million and will not have a material impact on future results of operations or financial condition 

  

during 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” and interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k for an expanded description of these new standards additionally the disclosure provisions of sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” have been implemented in note 18 “stockbased compensation” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

performance in 2001 compared with 2000 

  

overall performance 

  

our sales decreased 5 in 2001 to 82 billion from 86 billion in 2000 the majority of this sales decrease 4 is attributable to decreased volumes across all of our business segments sales for 2001 also declined 2 from foreign currency translation primarily within our coatings segment due to the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies these sales decreases were partially offset by a 1 increase in prices within our coatings and glass segments 

  

the gross profit percentage decreased to 371 in 2001 from 382 in 2000 increased raw material costs including natural gas particularly in our glass and chemicals segments along with unfavorable sales mix across our glass and chemicals segments were offset slightly by the benefits realized from improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments 

  

reported net income and earnings per share – diluted in 2001 and 2000 is summarized in the following table we have also identified significant nonrecurring items in 2001 and 2000 

  

   

the note references in the above table are found under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

the decrease in earnings is largely attributable to the lower sales volume and gross profit percentage described above in addition selling general and administrative expenses were up 31 million as the savings from our restructuring actions of about 35 million were more than offset by the additional overhead costs of businesses acquired during 2000 higher pension and other benefit costs higher growth related overhead in our architectural coatings business and the impact of inflation additional cost reductions of 25 million related to our restructuring actions are reflected in research and development costs and costs of sales

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

results of business segments 

  

   

coatings sales decreased 5 to 44 billion in 2001 from 47 billion in 2000 sales decreased 4 from decreased volumes primarily in our north american automotive original equipment refinish and industrial businesses sales also decreased 2 due to negative effects of foreign currency translation these decreases were offset slightly by a 1 increase from higher selling prices primarily in our refinish business operating income decreased to 495 million in 2001 compared to 685 million in 2000 operating income in 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 83 million excluding these pretax charges operating income in 2001 was 578 million the decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volumes and higher environmental pension and other benefit costs offset in part by improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower research and development costs 

  

glass sales decreased 5 to 22 billion in 2001 from 24 billion in 2000 sales decreased 6 from decreased volumes primarily in our north american automotive original and fiber glass businesses and 1 due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation these declines were offset by a 2 increase in selling prices due in part to more profitable product mix in our flat glass automotive replacement glass and fiber glass businesses operating income decreased to 255 million in 2001 compared to 377 million in 2000 operating income in 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 10 million and operating income in 2000 included pretax charges of 6 million for restructuring and onetime integration costs related to ppg auto glass excluding these pretax charges operating income in 2001 was 265 million compared to 383 million in 2000 the decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volumes primarily in our north american automotive original and fiber glass businesses the effects of higher natural gas costs and lower equity earnings partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies higher selling prices and the inclusion of a full year’s results of ppg auto glass 

  

chemicals sales decreased 6 to 15 billion in 2001 from 16 billion in 2000 sales volumes declined 4 primarily from our chlorine caustic soda chloralkali derivative and silica products sales also decreased 1 due to lower selling prices for our chloralkali derivative products and 1 due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation operating income decreased to 91 million in 2001 from 174 million in 2000 operating income in 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of 7 million excluding these pretax charges operating income in 2001 was 98 million the decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volumes higher natural gas and environmental costs and decreased manufacturing efficiencies 

  

other significant factors 

  

earnings in 2001 and 2000 included pension income of 53 million and 86 million respectively this decline in pension income is due primarily to a decline in the market value of pension plan assets during 2000 the market value of our pension plan assets continued to decrease during 2001 due primarily to the declines in the us equity markets see note 12 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for information concerning the pension plan assets and the components of pension income 

  

other unallocated corporate expense—net was 21 million in 2001 as compared to 54 million in 2000 included in 2001 is a pretax charge of 1 million for restructuring and other related costs included in 2000 are pretax charges of 39 million representing the writeoff of a 50 owned equity investment in pittsburgh corning corporation which has filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy code and 14 million representing an other than temporary decline in the market value of an investment in marketable equity securities previously recorded net of tax as an unrealized loss in other comprehensive loss 

  

the tax rate for ongoing operations was 36 in both 2001 and 2000 however the overall effective tax rate in 2001 was 3707 as the geographic spread of the restructuring charges taken in the first quarter provided a tax benefit of only 30 

  

the decrease in shortterm and longterm debt during 2001 is due principally to the repayment of various us and nonus debt obligations 

  

business restructuring 

  

during the first quarter of 2002 the company finalized plans to reduce costs increase efficiencies and accelerate performance improvement and took a pretax charge of 81 million for restructuring and other related activities including severance and other costs of 66 million and asset dispositions of 15 million it is expected that these activities will be completed by june 2003 the details of this charge were as follows 

  

 2002 annual report and form 10k ppg industries inc 21 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

during the first quarter of 2001 the company finalized plans to reduce costs increase efficiencies and accelerate performance improvement and took a pretax charge of 101 million for restructuring and other related activities including severance and other costs of 67 million and asset dispositions of 34 million as of dec 31 2002 these actions are complete the details of this charge were as follows 

  

   

in conjunction with the 2001 first quarter charge an additional 2 million of restructuring costs were recorded in 2001 as incurred and during the second quarter of 2002 4 million of the initial 101 million charge related to the coatings segment was reversed to income 

  

during 2002 and 2001 we paid 2 million and 17 million respectively related to restructuring reserves accrued in 2000 and 1999 see note 2 “acquisitions and business restructuring” under item 8 of this form 10k for an expanded description of these restructuring actions 

  

commitments and contingent liabilities including environmental matters 

  

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial monetary damages are sought see note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k for an expanded description of certain of these lawsuits including the proposed settlement of asbestos claims announced on may 14 2002 as discussed in note 13 although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable management believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg including asbestosrelated claims in the event the settlement described in note 13 does not become effective will not have a material effect on ppg’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs if any are recognized 

  

it is ppg’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 87 million and 94 million respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2002 2001 and 2000 totaled 15 million 29 million and 18 million respectively and are included in “other charges” in the statement of income under item 8 of this form 10k cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated 22 million 19 million and 16 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

management anticipates that the resolution of the company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between 10 million and 49 million per year we anticipate that charges against income in 2003 will be within that range it is possible however that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this expectation in management’s opinion the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg’s financial position or liquidity 

  

in addition to the amounts currently reserved the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as 200 million to 400 million which range is unchanged from the prior year end such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence the company’s environmental contingencies are expected to be resolved over an extended period of time 

  

although the unreserved exposure to future loss relates to all sites a significant portion of such exposure involves three operating plant sites in our chemicals segment initial remedial actions are occurring at these sites studies to determine the nature of the contamination are reaching completion and the need for additional remedial actions if any is presently being evaluated the loss contingencies related to the remaining portion of such unreserved exposure include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination if any at these other sites and the methods that may have to be employed should remediation be required the most significant of these sites is the calcasieu river estuary near our lake charles la chemicals plant the us environmental protection agency usepa has been investigating contamination levels in the calcasieu river estuary during 2002 the usepa issued draft human health and ecological risk assessments indicating that elevated levels of risk exist in the estuary it is expected that usepa could issue final risk assessments in 2003 followed by a remedial investigation report ppg would then have discussions with the usepa and other parties to determine what if any role ppg would have in addressing estuary issues

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

with respect to certain waste sites the financial condition of any other potentially responsible parties also contributes to the uncertainty of estimating ppg’s final costs although contributors of waste to sites involving other potentially responsible parties may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability in general final allocations of costs are made based on the relative contributions of wastes to such sites ppg is generally not a major contributor to such sites 

  

the impact of evolving programs such as natural resource damage claims industrial site reuse initiatives and state voluntary remediation programs also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this unreserved exposure to future loss the company’s assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation if necessary of such environmental contingencies 

  

impact of inflation 

  

ppg’s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 

  

in 2002 the decline in selling prices and the negative effects of inflation on our production costs were not fully recovered through improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses and lower raw material and natural gas costs in 2001 the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not fully recovered through price increases and manufacturing efficiencies which were adversely impacted by lower production volumes in 2000 the negative effects of inflation including the impact of higher natural gas costs were substantially offset in the aggregate by the impact of higher selling prices in our glass and chemicals businesses and manufacturing efficiencies in all of our businesses 

  

while inflationary and market pressures on costs are expected to be experienced in 2003 we anticipate that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies improvement in sales volume as well as increases in selling prices for certain products will more than offset the negative effect of inflation on 2003 operating income 

  

financial resources capital spending 

  

during the past three years we continued to have sufficient financial resources to meet operating requirements to fund our capital spending and share repurchase programs and to pay increased dividends to shareholders cash from operating activities was 872 million 1060 million and 870 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively dividends paid to shareholders totaled 287 million 283 million and 276 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

during 2002 the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock nor does it anticipate in the near term that any shares will be repurchased however during 2001 and 2000 the company repurchased approximately 01 million and 58 million shares of common stock at a cost of 5 million and 234 million respectively under various share repurchase programs the program initiated in november 1998 authorized the repurchase of 10 million shares of common stock as of dec 31 2002 91 million shares of common stock had been repurchased under this program at a cost of 421 million in october 2000 we authorized a program to repurchase an additional 10 million shares of common stock the repurchase of common stock was financed principally by cash from operations and proceeds from longterm debt additional shares were repurchased from the ppg employee savings plan 

  

capital spending was 260 million 301 million and 676 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively this spending related to business acquisitions totaling 22 million 10 million and 115 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively modernization and productivity improvements expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects capital spending in 2000 also included 83 million for marketable securities relating to the deferred compensation plan capital spending excluding acquisitions is expected to be in the range of 250 million to 300 million during 2003 

  

we periodically review our array of businesses in comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives as part of this review we may acquire or divest of certain businesses during 2003 we anticipate that any acquisitions completed will be funded through a combination of cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and to a lesser extent external funding sources or the issuance of stock 

   

  

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

the ratio of total debt including capital leases to total debt and equity was 49 and 44 at dec 31 2002 and 2001 respectively while we reduced our debt by over 400 million during 2002 this ratio was negatively impacted as equity was reduced by the aftertax impact of the asbestos settlement charge and the minimum pension liability adjustment recorded in 2002 cash from operations and the company’s debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending dividend payments contributions to pension plans amounts due under the asbestos settlement and operating requirements including ppg’s significant contractual obligations which are presented in the following table 

  

   

the unconditional purchase commitments are principally takeorpay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials including industrial gases and natural gas consistent with customary industry practice these also include ppg’s commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the rs cogen joint venture discussed in note 5 “investments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

see note 7 “debt and bank credit agreements and leases” under item 8 of this form 10k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit letters of credit guarantees and debt covenants 

  

in addition to the lines of credit the company may issue up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in july 1999 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes under item 8 of this form 10k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate we believe that the most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated and to accounting for pensions other postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 

  

contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable environmental remediation pending litigation against the company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years for more information on these matters see note 3 “working capital detail” note 11 “income taxes” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works to accomplish this extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation investment returns mortality turnover medical costs and discount rates these assumptions are reviewed annually in determining the expected return on plan asset assumption the company evaluates longterm actual return information the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of longterm investment returns in selecting rates for current and longterm health care assumptions the company takes into consideration a number of factors including the company’s actual health care cost increases the design of the company’s benefit programs the demographics of the company’s active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates out into the future see note 12 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” under item 8 of this form 10k for information on these plans 

  

as discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under item 8 of this form 10k the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of such assets to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows 

  

as part of our ongoing financial reporting process a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial credit environmental legal tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants engineers lawyers and actuaries the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

  

we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k related to these contingencies pensions postretirement benefits goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 

   

  

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

currency 

  

the euro and the british pound sterling strengthened against the us dollar 18 and 11 respectively during 2002 the effects of translating the net assets and net earnings of our operations denominated in these currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by approximately 140 million but did not have a significant impact on the results of operations 

  

this was offset in part by the continued devaluation of the argentine peso which reduced our net investment in argentina by 39 million to a total of 29 million at dec 31 2002 any reduction in the value of these net assets resulting from a further devaluation of the argentine peso will result in a direct charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders’ equity 

  

research and development 

  

innovation and technology have been a hallmark of our company’s success throughout its history research and development costs totaled over 3 of sales in each of the past three years representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2003 these costs include technologydriven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service as well as the costs of developing new products because of our broad array of products and customers we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company management’s discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect the company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 

  

forwardlooking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the sec also note the following cautionary statements 

  

many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forwardlooking statements among these factors are increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements economic and political conditions in international markets the ability to penetrate existing developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets which also depends on economic and political conditions foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates and the unpredictability of possible future litigation including litigation that could result if the asbestos settlement does not become effective further it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently while the list of factors presented here is considered representative no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forwardlooking statements 

  

the consequences of material differences in the results as compared to those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements could include among other things business disruption operational problems financial loss legal liability to third parties and similar risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition operations or liquidity 

   

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and natural gas prices arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce this market risk a detailed description of these exposures and the company’s risk management policies are provided in note 9 “derivative financial instruments” under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 were used to hedge ppg’s exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk the fair value of these contracts was an asset of 1 million as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 the potential reduction in ppg’s earnings resulting from adverse changes in the exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 for european currencies and 20 for asian and south american currencies would have totaled approximately 1 million and 4 million as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

ppg had nonus dollardenominated debt of 317 million and 409 million as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 respectively a weakening of the us dollar by 10 against european currencies and by 20 against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately 46 million and 59 million as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg’s interest rate risk and as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of 23 million and a liability of 20 million respectively the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by 7 million as of dec 31 2002 and increased by 11 million as of dec 31 2001 if variable interest rates changed unfavorably by 10 a 10 increase in interest rates in the us canada mexico and europe and a 20 increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately 3 million and 6 million as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 respectively further a 10 reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 53 million and 62 million as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 respectively such changes would not have had a material effect on ppg’s annual earnings or cash flows 

  

the fair value of natural gas swap and option contracts was an asset of 24 million and a liability of 12 million as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 respectively these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg’s exposure to rising prices of natural gas a 10 reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap and option contracts outstanding as of dec 31 2002 and 2001 of approximately 8 million and 12 million respectively 

  

in november 2002 an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust see note 9 “derivative financial instruments” and note 13 “commitments and contingent liabilities” under item 8 of this form 10k the fair value of this instrument as of dec 31 2002 was an asset of 1 million a 10 unfavorable change in ppg’s stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument to a liability of 2 million

34900 the company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout

environmental matters

like other companies ppg is subject to the existing and evolving standards
relating to the protection of the environment capital expenditures for
environmental control projects were 22 million 22 million and 19 million
in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively it is expected that expenditures for
such projects in 2002 will approximate 25 million with similar amounts of
annual expenditures expected in the near future although future capital
expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly
changing regulatory standards and policies it can be anticipated that
environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and costly

ppg is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 98 current and
former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations including 27
sites on the national priority list npl while ppg is not generally a major
contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations each
potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint
and several liability generally however a final allocation of costs is made
based on relative contributions of wastes to the site there is a wide range
of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites due largely to uncertainties as
to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to
be employed for their remediation the company has established reserves for
those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount can be reasonably estimated as of december 31 2001 and 2000 ppg had
reserves for environmental contingencies totaling 94 million and 84 million
respectively pretax charges against income for environmental remediation
costs totaled 29 million in 2001 18 million in 2000 and 10 million in
1999

the companys experience to date regarding environmental matters leads ppg to
believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with
provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and
future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites management anticipates
that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time and could
result in charges against income of up to 50 million in 2002 it is possible
however that technological regulatory and enforcement developments the
results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this
expectation in addition a portion of such environmental expenditures may be
recovered from insurers and other third parties in managements opinion the
company operates in an environmentally sound manner is well positioned
relative to environmental matters within the industries in which it operates
and the outcome of these environmental matters will not have a material
adverse effect on ppgs financial position or liquidity see commitments and
contingent liabilities including environmental matters in managements

matters









item 2 properties

see item 1 business for information on ppgs production and fabrication
facilities

generally the companys plants are suitable and adequate for the purposes for
which they are intended and overall have sufficient capacity to conduct
business in the upcoming year



item 3 legal proceedings

ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential
including some that it has asserted against others in which substantial
monetary damages are sought these lawsuits and claims relate to product
liability contract patent environmental antitrust and other matters
arising out of the conduct of ppgs business except with respect to any ppg
contribution arising out of a possible voluntary settlement of asbestos claims
as discussed below the amount of which cannot be predicted management
believes that in the aggregate the outcome of all lawsuits and claims
involving ppg will not have a material effect on ppgs consolidated financial
position or liquidity however such outcome may be material to the results of
operations of the period in which the costs if any are recognized included
among ppgs legal proceedings are the following

the company has been named as a defendant in a number of antitrust lawsuits
filed in federal and state courts by various plaintiffs these suits allege
ppg was involved with competitors in fixing prices and allocating markets for
the automotive refinish industry and for certain glass products twentynine
glass antitrust cases were

                                       3
page

filed in federal courts all of which have been consolidated in a single
federal district court and the court has ruled that the case may proceed as a
class action all of the initial defendants in the glass antitrust actions
except ppg have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs in
addition over 65 cases alleging antitrust violations in the automotive
refinish industry have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions
and have been consolidated the plaintiffs in these cases are seeking economic
and treble damages and injunctive relief the company believes it has
meritorious defenses in these lawsuits

the company has been a defendant since april 1994 in a suit filed in the
federal district court in st paul minnesota by marvin windows and doors
marvin alleging numerous claims including breach of warranty the district
court dismissed the plaintiffs claims in 1999 but certain of the claims were
reinstated on appeal the eighth circuit us court of appeals dismissed 12 of
13 claims but allowed the plaintiff to proceed to trial on a breach of
warranty claim on feb 14 2002 the federal jury awarded marvin 136 million
on the remaining claim ppg believes it has meritorious defenses to the
plaintiffs claims and intends to appeal the jurys decision

for over thirty years ppg has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims
alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos aggregate settlements by
ppg to date have been immaterial at december 31 2001 ppg was one of many
defendants in numerous asbestosrelated lawsuits involving about 116000
claims in many of the cases the plaintiffs allege that ppg should be liable
for injuries involving asbestoscontaining thermal insulation products
manufactured and distributed by pittsburgh corning corporation pc ppg and
corning incorporated are each 50 shareholders in pc ppg believes that it is
not responsible for any injuries caused by pc products and intends to defend
against such claims prior to 2000 ppg had never been found liable for any
such claims and in numerous cases ppg had been dismissed on motions prior to
trial in january 2000 in a trial in a state court in texas involving six
plaintiffs the jury found ppg not liable however a week later in a separate
trial also in state court in texas another jury found ppg for the first
time partly responsible for injuries to five plaintiffs alleged to be caused
by pc products ppg intends to appeal the adverse verdict

on april 16 2000 pc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the federal
bankruptcy court in pittsburgh pennsylvania accordingly in the first
quarter of 2000 ppg recorded an aftertax charge of 35 million for the
writeoff of all of its investment in pc as a consequence of the bankruptcy
filing and the various motions and orders in that proceeding the asbestos
litigation against ppg and against pc and corning incorporated related to pc
products has been stayed and the filing of additional asbestos suits against
them has been enjoined until march 1 2002 during the pendency of the stay
interested parties including pc and ppg among others have been engaged in
discussions to determine whether a settlement of current and potential
asbestos claims can be agreed on within the context of the pc bankruptcy
proceeding the court has extended the stay several times with the parties
consent in order to facilitate settlement discussions these settlement
discussions involve numerous complex issues accordingly it is impossible to
predict whether when or on what terms a voluntary settlement if any on the
part of ppg might be reached

over the past ten years the company and others have been named as defendants
in several cases claiming damages related to exposure to lead ppg has been
dismissed as a defendant from most of those lawsuits and has never been found
liable in any of those cases

although ppg believes it has adequate insurance for the personal injury and
property damage claims against ppg described above certain of ppgs insurers
are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims ppgs lawsuits
and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third
parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental
asbestos and other matters

securities and exchange commission regulations require the disclosure of any
environmental legal proceedings in which a governmental authority is party and
which may reasonably be expected to involve monetary sanctions in excess of
100000 in this regard ppg received a notice of violation from the us
environmental protection agency with respect to ppgs facilities in lexington
and shelby north carolina in february 2002 ppg entered into a consent
decree providing for a final penalty of 250000 to resolve this matter
